Although frontline treatment options (medication, deep brain stimulation, and focused ultrasound ablation)  have provided significant relief, many patients are unsatisfied with the  outcomes. Peripheral suppression techniques, such as injections of botulinum  toxin or sensory electrical stimulation of muscles, are gaining popularity, but  could be optimized if the muscles most responsible for a patient's tremor were  identified. The purpose of this study was to quantify the relationship between  the activity in various upper limb muscles and the resulting tremor in patients  with ET. Surface electromyogram (sEMG) from the 15 major superficial muscles of  the upper limb and displacement of the hand and upper limb joints were recorded  from 22 persons with ET while they performed kinetic and postural tasks  representative of activities of daily living. We calculated the peak coherence  (frequency-dependent correlation) in the tremor band (4-8 Hz) between the sEMG of  each muscle and the displacement in each major degree of freedom (DOF). Averaged  across subjects with ET, the highest coherence was found between elbow flexors  (particularly biceps brachii and brachioradialis) and the distal DOF (forearm,  wrist, and hand motion), and between wrist extensors (extensor carpi radialis and  ulnaris) and the same distal DOF. These coherence values represent the upper  bound on the proportion of the tremor caused by each muscle. We conclude that,  without further information, elbow flexors and wrist extensors should be among  the first muscles considered for peripheral suppression techniques in persons  with ET.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We characterized the relationships between activity in  upper limb muscles and tremor in persons with essential tremor using coherence,  which provides an upper bound on the proportion of the tremor due to each muscle.  Averaged across subjects and various tasks, tremor in the hand and distal joints  was most coherent with elbow flexors and wrist extensors. We conclude that,  without further information, these muscle groups should be among the first  considered for peripheral suppression techniques.","2024-02-01","2024-03-06 17:05:16","2024-03-06T17:05:16Z","","337-348","","2","136","","J Appl Physiol (1985)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38126087","","","","*Essential Tremor/therapy; *Wrist/physiology; Activities of Daily Living; EMG; Elbow; Electromyography; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal/physiology; Tremor/therapy; Upper Extremity; coherence; essential tremor; joint; muscle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Numerous focal therapy modalities are currently available with early  data demonstrating highly variable rates of cancer control and preservation of  sexual/urinary function. METHODS: All English language clinical trial  publications evaluating various focal therapies for localized prostate cancer  were reviewed. The literature search was limited to studies from the modern era  of MRI-guided treatment, as MRI is hypothesized to improve tumor localization and  targeting. Primary outcomes were post-treatment cancer-free rates,  in-field/out-of-field recurrence rates, and rates of conversion to radical  therapy. Secondary outcomes were related to functional status and adverse events.  RESULTS: Numerous focal therapies were identified with clinical data including  high-intensity focused ultrasound, transurethral ultrasound ablation, focal laser  ablation, focal cryotherapy, irreversible electroporation, and photodynamic  therapy. Recurrence rates among all technologies were low to moderate (0-51%) and  rates of freedom from radical treatment were highly variable (46-98%). Rates of  erectile dysfunction and incontinence generally ranged from 0 to 44% and 0 to  12%, respectively, with variability between focal therapy modalities. Caution  should be exercised when comparing studies as outcomes are strongly associated  with patient selection. No individual focal therapy is currently recommended by  society guidelines. Randomized controlled trials are ongoing in search of a  standard of care. CONCLUSION: For localized MRI-visible prostate cancer, early  clinical trial data demonstrate that focal therapy can provide good to moderate  cancer control while having preferable side effect profiles compared to  whole-gland treatments. While current studies do not make head-to-head  comparisons between technologies, early data suggest a potential for these  technologies to provide adequate cancer control in a well-selected patient  population. The oncologic outcomes of some focal therapies appear promising;  however, longer-term follow-up data are needed to assess the durability of early  outcomes.","2023-06","2024-03-06 17:04:38","2024-03-06T17:04:38Z","","218-227","","2","26","","Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Because  of their natural axisymmetric geometry, ultrasound generation with ring  transducers can take advantage of the biaxial driving to change the focus of the  beam generated by this type of transducer using only two driving signals. In this  study, we applied the biaxial driving technique into a single-element PZT ring  transducer operating at 500 kHz to produce a change in size and position of the  focal spot while using the 1st (482 kHz), 3rd (1.362 MHz) and 5th (2.62 MHz)  harmonic excitation. The transducer had a thickness of 2.85 mm, an inner diameter  of 9.75 mm and a ring width of 2.0 mm, and two pairs of electrodes as required  for biaxial driving. Simulation and experimental results showed that both the  focal area and the distance at which the focal area centre was located changed as  a function of the phase and power difference between the two driving signals.  Experimental results showed that the focal area could be reduced from 31.6 mm(2)  (conventional driving) to 3.4 mm(2) (89 % reduction) when using the first  harmonic excitation. For the third harmonic, the focal area could be reduced from  4.0 mm(2) (conventional driving) to 3.3 mm(2) (17.5 % reduction). For the fifth  harmonic, the focal area could be reduced from 1.7 mm(2) (conventional driving)  to 1 mm(2) (41.7 % reduction). Results also demonstrated the centre of the focus  could be displaced between 3.0 mm and 9.3 mm from the surface of the transducer  when using the first harmonic, between 7.3 mm and 8.4 mm at the third harmonic,  and between 4.9 mm and 8.2 mm at the fifth harmonic. The reduction in the focus  area, as well as the possibility to displace the focus dynamically will be  advantageous for preclinical applications of focused ultrasound, especially on  drug delivery and neuromodulation studies in small rodents.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","107051","","","133","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

We herein propose a reliable strategy  for non-invasively delivering a specific anti-Aβ antibody in a mouse model of AD  by microbubbles-enhanced Focused Ultrasound (FUS)-mediated Blood-brain barrier  disruption (BBBD), using a simple single stage MR-compatible positioning device.  METHODS: The initial experimental work involved wild-type mice and was devoted to  selecting the sonication protocol for efficient and safe BBBD. Pulsed FUS was  applied using a single-element FUS transducer of 1 MHz (80 mm radius of curvature  and 50 mm diameter). The success and extent of BBBD were assessed by Evans Blue  extravasation and brain damage by hematoxylin and eosin staining. 5XFAD mice were  divided into different subgroups; control (n = 1), FUS + MBs alone (n = 5),  antibody alone (n = 5), and FUS + antibody combined (n = 10). The changes in  antibody deposition among groups were determined by immunohistochemistry.  RESULTS: It was confirmed that the antibody could not normally enter the brain  parenchyma. A single treatment with MBs-enhanced pulsed FUS using the optimized  protocol (1 MHz, 0.5 MPa in-situ pressure, 10 ms bursts, 1% duty factor, 100 s  duration) transiently disrupted the BBB allowing for non-invasive antibody  delivery to amyloid plaques within the sonicated brain regions. This was  consistently reproduced in ten mice. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings  should be confirmed by longer-term studies examining the antibody effects on  plaque clearance and cognitive benefit to hold promise for developing  disease-modifying anti-Aβ therapeutics for clinical use.","2023-07-29","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","J Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Recent ultrasound preclincal  studies utilizing large or whole brain stimulation regions create a demand for  expanding the treatment envelope of transcranial pulsed-low intensity ultrasound  towards Global Brain Sonication (GBS) for potential human investigation. Here, we  conduct ultrasound field characterizations when transmitting pulsed ultrasound  through human skull specimens using a 1-3 piezocomposite planar transducer  operating at 464 kHz with an active single-element surface of 30 × 30 cm. Through  computational simulation and hydrophone scanning methodology, ultrasound wave  behavior and dose homogeneity in the brain space were evaluated under various  trajectories of sonication using the planar transducer. Clinically relevant pulse  parameters used for transcranial therapeutic ultrasound applications were used in  the experiments. Simulations and empirical testing revealed that dose homogeneity  and acoustic intensity over the brain space are influenced by sonication  trajectory, skull lens effects, and acoustic wave reflections. The transducer can  emit a spatial peak pulse average intensity of 4.03 W/cm(2) (0.24 MPa) measured  in the free-field at 464 kHz with electrical power of 1 kW. The simulation showed  that approximately 99 % of the cranial volume was exposed with <30 % of the  maximum external acoustic intensity being transmitted into the skull. The  transmission loss across all sonication trajectories is similar to previously  reported FUS studies. A marker for GBS dose homogeneity is introduced to score  the ultrasound pressure field uniformity in the intracranial space. Results of  this study identify the initial challenges of exposing the entire human brain  space with ultrasound using a large cranium-wide sonication beam intended for  global brain therapeutic modulation.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","107062","","","134","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS)  using transthoracic scanning protocols, such as FUSIC Heart, has empowered  non-cardiologists to rapidly identify and treat the major causes of haemodynamic  instability. There are, however, circumstances when a transoesphageal, rather  than transthoracic approach, may be preferrable. Due to the close anatomical  proximity between the oesophagus, stomach and heart, a transoesphageal  echocardiogram (TOE) can potentially overcome many of the limitations encountered  in patients with poor transthoracic ultrasound windows. These are typically  patients with severe obesity, chest wall injuries, inability to lie in the left  lateral decubitus position and those receiving high levels of positive airway  pressure. In 2022, to provide all acute care practitioners with the opportunity  to acquire competency in focused TOE, the Intensive Care Society (ICS) and  Association of Anaesthetists (AA) launched a new accreditation pathway, known as  Focused Transoesophageal Echo (fTOE). The aim of fTOE is to provide the  practitioner with the necessary information to identify the aetiology of  haemodynamic instability. Focused TOE can be taught in a shorter period of time  than comprehensive and teaching programmes are achievable with support from  cardiothoracic anaesthetists, intensivists and cardiologists. Registration for  fTOE accreditation requires registration via the ICS website. Learning material  include theoretical modules, clinical cases and multiple-choice questions. Fifty  fTOE examinations are required for the logbook, and these must cover a range of  pathology, including ventricular dysfunction, pericardial effusion, tamponade,  pleural effusion and low preload. The final practical assessment may be  undertaken when the supervisors deem the candidate's knowledge and skills  consistent with that required for independent practice. After the practitioner  has been accredited in fTOE, they must maintain knowledge and competence through  relevant continuing medical education. Accreditation in fTOE represents a joint  venture between the ICS and AA and is endorsed by Association of Cardiothoracic  Anaesthesia and Critical care (ACTACC). The process is led by TOE experts, and  represents a valuable expansion in the armamentarium of acute care practitioners  to assess haemodynamically unstable patients.","2023-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","419-426","","4","24","","J Intensive Care Soc","","","","","","","","eng","© The Intensive Care Society 2023.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37841296  PMCID: PMC10572472","","","","Focused; echocardiography; intensive care; intraoperative; transoesophageal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study introduces a microfocused  ultrasound (MFU) device, ULTIGHT, to overcome the severe pain issue, providing  quasi-facial lifting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transducer surface was imaged with a  scanning electron microscope. The energies of four treatment cartridges were  measured using an ultrasound power meter. In vitro experiments were performed to  quantitatively evaluate the MFU thermal zones (MFUTZs) and treatment line (TL) of  10 MFUTZs. Ex vivo experiments were performed to evaluate the MFUTZs and  temperature rise in tissue. Clinical trials using eight volunteers were performed  to qualitatively evaluate facial lifting. RESULTS: The MFU transducer clearly  showed a smooth and no air gap surface. ULTIGHT produced 10 discrete MFUTZs in a  TL of length 10 mm. In ex vivo tissue, discrete linear MFUTZs were clearly  observed at lower number of TLs; however, they started to aggregate at higher  number of TLs. The temperature rise was linearly increased as a function of the  number of treatments. A single MFUTZ resulted in a temperature rise of 3°C-10°C  that could cause hyperthermia for body temperature. In the clinical trials, the  volunteers showed quasi-facial lifting right after treatment on the lower facial  region. CONCLUSIONS: ULTIGHT provides relatively low energy, which may be  advantageous or disadvantageous depending on clinical applications. Additionally,  it has the advantage of being pain-free even without anesthetic during treatment,  providing quasi-facial lifting right after treatment.","2023-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2982-2988","","11","22","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

This study investigated whether  cavitation could also enhance the extravasation of larger (>10 µm) therapeutic  particles, representative of radio- or chemo-embolic particles, in a  tissue-mimicking phantom. METHODS: High-speed (10(3)-10(6) frames/s) optical  imaging was used to observe the motion of glass microspheres with diameters of  15-32 or 105-107 µm in an agar phantom under exposure to high-intensity focused  ultrasound (0.5 MHz) at a range of peak negative pressures (1.9-2.8 MPa) in the  presence of SonoVue microbubbles. RESULTS: In contrast to the microstreaming  reported to be responsible for nanoparticle transport, the formation and  translation of bubble clouds were found to be primarily responsible for the  motion of glass microspheres. The bubble clouds were seen both to create channels  in the phantom and to travel along them under the action of primary acoustic  radiation force, either propelling or entraining microspheres with them.  Collisions between microspheres were also seen to promote cloud formation and  cavitation activity. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-mediated cavitation can promote the  transport of solid microparticles in tissue-mimicking material. Further work is  needed to understand the influence of tissue mechanical properties and ultrasound  exposure parameters on the extent and uniformity of particle distribution that  can be achieved.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1415-1421","","6","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

This research  investigated the feasibility of FAV-mediated sonochemotherapy combined with the  immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to reshape immunosuppressive tumor  microenvironment (TME), inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis. Sonosensitizer  chlorin e6 (Ce6) and chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (Dox) were co-loaded into  microbubble-liposome complex to compose Ce6/Dox@Lip@MBs (CDLM) for ""all-in-one""  synergistic sonochemotherapy, whose main components were clinical approved.  FAV-activated CDLM significantly enriched immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers  in tumors and amplified ICD of cancer cells compared with FUS-activated CDLM.  Furthermore, the amplified-ICD combined with ICB increased the infiltration of  cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, polarized M2 macrophages to M1  macrophages, and decreased regulatory T cells.

In echocardiography, this is especially needed due to the existence of  rapidly moving structures, such as the heart valves. In the last two decades,  various methods have been proposed to improve the frame rate. Here, we propose a  novel method, based on binary coding patterns (BCPs) and tensor completion (TC),  to increase the temporal resolution (i.e., frame rate) in the preprocessing stage  of conventional focused ultrasound imaging (CFUI). The rationale behind our  proposal is to perform, at first, the beamforming of a fraction of the scan  lines, randomly selected in each frame based on BCP. Then, we reconstruct the  missing scan lines through TC. The latter is an effective technique for  recovering missing information from a low-rank tensor, based on a small number of  observations using rank minimization. Following our approach, reducing the  transmissions events needed to generate an image, the frame rate is increased by  the same proportion. We have applied the proposed technique to a pre-beamformed  radio frequency (RF) echocardiographic dataset. Our results show that we can  improve the frame rate by a factor from 3 to 4, while keeping the structural  similarity (SSIM) of the reconstructed tensor and the original one at values  higher than 0.98.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","41-51","","1","70","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36399594","","","","*Echocardiography/methods; *Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Phantoms, Imaging; Ultrasonography/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There were no serious adverse  events and 12 mild/moderate severity events. The mean age was 50.9 years (SD:  12.7), and the mean symptom duration was 12.3 years (SD: 9.7). Among eight  patients with a 1-year follow-up, the brief pain inventory decreased from 7.6  (SD: 1.1) to 3.8 (SD: 2.8), with a mean percent decrease of 46.3 (SD: 40.6)  (paired t-test, P = .017). The mean pain disability index decreased from 43.0  (SD: 7.5) to 25.8 (SD: 16.8), with a mean percent decrease of 39.3 (SD: 41.6) (P  = .034). Numeric rating scale scores decreased from a mean of 7.2 (SD: 1.8) to  4.0 (SD: 2.8), with a mean percent decrease of 42.8 (SD: 37.8) (P = .024).  Patients with predominantly intermittent pain or with allodynia responded better  than patients with continuous pain or without allodynia, respectively. Some  patients decreased medication use. Resting-state functional connectivity changes  were noted, from disruption of the DMN at baseline to reactivation of  connectivity between DMN nodes at 3 months. CONCLUSION: MRgFUS CLT is feasible  and safe for refractory NP and has potential utility in reducing symptoms as  measured by validated pain scales.","2023-11-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","Neurosurgery","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2023.

This study aimed  to explore the clinical value of GMV to assess magnetic resonance imaging-guided  focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy as a treatment for tremor-dominant PD  (TDPD). METHODS: Nine TDPD patients with MRgFUS thalamotomy were recruited for  structural magnetic resonance image (MRI) scanning and clinical score evaluation.  GMV was calculated. To investigate changes after treatment, voxel- and region of  interest (ROI)-wise GMV analyses were performed. Then, GMV with significant  differences was extracted from patients to investigate its dynamic alterations by  one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The nonparametric  Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between  GMV alterations and tremor improvement after thalamotomy. RESULTS: Tremors were  significantly relieved after MRgFUS thalamotomy in nine patients (P<0.05). The  treated hand tremor scores improved 74.82% on average in patients from  pre-operation to 12 months post-operation. Voxel-wise analysis at the cluster  level showed a significant decrease in GMV in the left middle occipital gyrus  (MOG) [t=11.81, voxel-level P<0.001, cluster-level P(family-wise error (FWE))  <0.05] and an increase in GMV in the left precentral gyrus (PreCG) (t=7.99,  voxel-level P<0.001, cluster-level P(FWE) <0.05) in TDPD patients from  preoperative to 12 months post-operation, which was significantly correlated with  tremor scores (rho =0.346-0.439, P<0.05). ROI-wise analysis showed that GMV  related to MRgFUS thalamotomy was associated with long-term structural  alterations (P<0.05 with Bonferroni correction), including specific basal ganglia  and related nuclei and cerebellum subregions. CONCLUSIONS: GMV can be used to  reflect tremor improvement after MRgFUS thalamotomy and be helpful to better  understand the distant effect of MRgFUS thalamotomy and the involvement of GMV in  tremor control in TDPD.

Identification of the molecular drivers  and pathways of neurodegeneration is critical to individualized targeted  treatment of these disorders. However, despite important advances in fluid  biomarker detection, characterization of these molecular subtypes is limited by  the blood-brain barrier. Purpose To evaluate the feasibility and safety of  focused ultrasound-mediated liquid biopsy (sonobiopsy) in the detection of  brain-derived protein biomarkers in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy (PS19  mice). Materials and Methods Sonobiopsy was performed by sonicating the cerebral  hemisphere in 2-month-old PS19 and wild-type mice, followed by measurement of  plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species (30 minutes after sonication in the  sonobiopsy group). Next, spatially targeted sonobiopsy was performed by  sonicating either the cerebral cortex or the hippocampus in 6-month-old PS19  mice. To detect changes in plasma neurofilament light chain (a biomarker of  neurodegeneration) levels, blood samples were collected before and after  sonication (15 and 45-60 minutes after sonication). Histologic staining was  performed to evaluate tissue damage after sonobiopsy. The Shapiro-Wilk test,  unpaired and paired t tests, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used. Results In  the 2-month-old mice, sonobiopsy significantly increased the normalized levels of  plasma p-tau species compared with the conventional blood-based liquid biopsy  (p-tau-181-to-mouse tau [m-tau] ratio: 1.7-fold increase, P = .006;  p-tau-231-to-m-tau ratio: 1.4-fold increase, P = .048). In the 6-month-old PS19  mice, spatially targeted sonobiopsy resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in plasma  neurofilament light chain after sonication of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex  (P < .001). After optimization of the sonobiopsy parameters, no excess  microhemorrhage was observed in the treated cerebral hemisphere compared with the  contralateral side. Conclusion This study showed the feasibility of sonobiopsy to  release phosphorylated tau species and neurofilament light chain to the blood  circulation, potentially facilitating diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. ©  RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected vaginal secretions at the time of  admission and 3 months after FU treatment from 169 women who received FU  treatment for cervical HR-HPV infection between July 2020 and September 2022.  Among them, there were 101 patients with cute vaginitis, we also collected their  vaginal secretions after one week of drug treatment. These samples were evaluated  for vaginal microecology and HPV-DNA examination. RESULTS: Of the 169 patients,  101 (59.7%) suffered from acute vaginitis at the time of admission. After one  week of targeted antibiotics drug treatment, there were no pathogens or pus cells  on the field of microscopic vision, but there was no significant  difference(p > 0.05) in the diversity and density of vaginal flora, the  proportion and function of Lactobacillus (H(2)O(2) negative rate) between one  week after treatment and at the time of admission. At the time of admission of  the 169 patients, the normal flora rate was 40.3%, which increased to 93.5% three  months after FU treatment. The differences in vaginal secretion parameters at the  time of admission and 3 months after FU treatment were as follows: H(2)O(2)  negative rate (37.3% vs. 3.6%), leukocyte esterase positive rate (54.4% vs.  5.9%), sialidase positive rate (38.5% vs. 4.1%), bacterial vaginitis positive  rate (55% vs. 4.7%), fungal vaginitis positive rate (44.4% vs. 5.9%), and  trichomonal vaginitis positive rate (7.1% vs. 0). The difference was  statistically significant (p < 0.01). The pH value and Nagent score at the time  of admission were significantly higher than those three months after FU. Three  months after FU, the positive rate of HPV was 5.8% in the group of patients with  normal vaginal microecology at the time of admission and post-FU; it was 6.7% in  the group of patients with abnormal vaginal microecology at the time of admission  and normal vaginal microecology post-FU; and it was 100% in the group patients  with abnormal vaginal microecology at the time of admission and post-FU. A  significant difference was observed among the three groups (p < 0.01).  CONCLUSION: FU is an effective treatment for patients with cervical HR-HPV  infection. FU does not interfere with the vaginal microecology of HR-HPV positive  patients with normal vaginal microecology.FU followed by antibiotic drug therapy  for pathogens is beneficial to restore the function of Lactobacillus vaginalis in  HR-HPV positive patients with acute vaginitis,so as to improve the vaginal  microecology of HR-HPV positive patients with abnormal vaginal microecology.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2211276","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37357319","","","","*Papillomavirus Infections/drug therapy; *Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; *Vaginitis/drug therapy/microbiology; Female; Focused ultrasound; HR-HPV infection; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Papillomaviridae/genetics; Vagina/diagnostic imaging; cervix; vaginal microecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously, the  authors reported the short-term safety and feasibility of FUS BBB opening of the  hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) in patients with AD. Given the need to  treat larger brain regions beyond the hippocampus and EC, brain volumes and  locations treated with FUS have now expanded. To evaluate any potential adverse  consequences of BBB opening on disease progression, the authors report safety,  imaging, and clinical outcomes among participants with mild AD at 6-12 months  after FUS treatment targeted to the hippocampus, frontal lobe, and parietal lobe.  METHODS: In this open-label trial, participants with mild AD underwent MRI-guided  FUS sonication to open the BBB in β-amyloid positive regions of the hippocampus,  EC, frontal lobe, and parietal lobe. Participants underwent 3 separate FUS  treatment sessions performed 2 weeks apart. Outcome assessments included safety,  imaging, neurological, cognitive, and florbetaben β-amyloid PET. RESULTS: Ten  participants (range 55-76 years old) completed 30 separate FUS treatments at 2  participating institutions, with 6-12 months of follow-up. All participants had  immediate BBB opening after FUS and BBB closure within 24-48 hours. All FUS  treatments were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to the  procedure. All 10 participants had a minimum of 6 months of follow-up, and 7  participants had a follow-up out to 1 year. Changes in the Alzheimer's Disease  Assessment Scale-cognitive and Mini-Mental State Examination scores were  comparable to those in controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging  Initiative. PET scans demonstrated an average β-amyloid plaque of 14% in the  Centiloid scale in the FUS-treated regions. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the  largest cohort of participants with mild AD who received FUS treatment, and has  the longest follow-up to date. Safety was demonstrated in conjunction with  reversible and repeated BBB opening in multiple cortical and deep brain  locations, with a concomitant reduction of β-amyloid. There was no apparent  cognitive worsening beyond expectations up to 1 year after FUS treatment,  suggesting that the BBB opening treatment in multiple brain regions did not  adversely influence AD progression. Further studies are needed to determine the  clinical significance of these findings. FUS offers a unique opportunity to  decrease amyloid plaque burden as well as the potential to deliver targeted  therapeutics to multiple brain regions in patients with neurodegenerative  disorders.","2023-07-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","275-283","","1","139","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36334289","","","","*Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging/therapy; *Blood-Brain Barrier/diagnostic imaging/metabolism; Aged; Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides/metabolism; BBB; Brain/metabolism; Cognition; FUS; Humans; Middle Aged; Plaque, Amyloid; blood-brain barrier opening; focused ultrasound; surgical technique; β-amyloid plaque","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Radiation therapy (RT),  despite being the mainstay adjuvant modality regardless of BBB, the effect of  radiation induced cell death is hindered by the hypoxic microenvironment. Focused  ultrasound (FUS) combined with systemic microbubbles has been shown not only to  open BBB but also potentially increased regional perfusion. However, no clinical  study has investigated the combination of RT with FUS-BBB opening (RT-FUS).  METHODS: We aimed to provide preclinical evidence of RT-FUS combination in GBM  animal model, and to report an interim analysis of an ongoing single arm,  prospective, pilot study (NCT01628406) of combining RT-FUS for recurrent  malignant high grade glioma patients, of whom re-RT was considered for disease  control. In both preclinical and clinical studies, FUS-BBB opening was conducted  within 2 h before RT. Treatment responses were evaluated by objective response  rate (ORR) using magnetic resonance imaging, progression free survival, and  overall survival, and adverse events (AE) in clinical study. Survival analysis  was performed in preclinical study and descriptive analysis was performed in  clinical study. RESULTS: In mouse GBM model, the survival analysis showed RT-FUS  (2 Gy) group was significantly longer than RT (2 Gy) group and control, but not  RT (5 Gy) group. In the pilot clinical trial, an interim analysis of six  recurrent malignant high grade glioma patients underwent a total of 24 RT-FUS  treatments was presented. Three patients had rapid disease progression at a mean  of 33 days after RT-FUS, while another three patients had at least stable disease  (mean 323 days) after RT-FUS with or without salvage chemotherapy or target  therapy. One patient had partial response after RT-FUS, making the ORR of 16.7%.  There was no FUS-related AEs, but one (16.7%) re-RT-related grade three radiation  necrosis. CONCLUSION: Reirradiation is becoming an option after disease  recurrence for both primary and secondary malignant brain tumors since systemic  therapy significantly prolongs survival in cancer patients. The mechanism behind  the synergistic effect of RT-FUS in preclinical model needs further study. The  clinical evidence from the interim analysis of an ongoing clinical trial  (NCT01628406) showed a combination of RT-FUS was safe (no FUS-related adverse  effect). A comprehensive analysis of radiation dosimetry and FUS energy  distribution is expected after completing the final recruitment.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","535-545","","3","165","","J Neurooncol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

However, the two pathologies are expressed concurrently in  human disease. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the  effects of repeated bilateral sonications in the presence of both pathologies.  Methods: Herein, we investigate its functional and morphological outcomes on  brains bearing both pathologies simultaneously. Eleven transgenic mice of the  3xTg-AD line (14 months old) expressing human amyloid beta and human tau and  eleven age-matched wild-type littermates received four weekly bilateral  sonications covering the hippocampus followed by working memory testing.  Afterwards, immunohistochemistry and immunoassays (western blot and ELISA) were  employed to assess any changes in amyloid beta and human tau. Furthermore, we  present preliminary data from our clinical trial using a neuronavigation-guided  FUS system for sonications in AD patients (NCT04118764). Results: Interestingly,  both wild-type and transgenic animals that received FUS experienced improved  working memory and spent significantly more time in the escape platform-quadrant,  with wild-type animals spending 43.2% (sham: 37.7%) and transgenic animals  spending 35.3% (sham: 31.0%) of the trial in the target quadrant. Furthermore,  this behavioral amelioration in the transgenic animals correlated with a 58.3%  decrease in the neuronal length affected by tau and a 27.2% reduction in total  tau levels. Amyloid plaque population, volume and overall load were also reduced  overall. Consistently, preliminary data from a clinical trial involving AD  patients showed a 1.8% decrease of amyloid PET signal 3-weeks after treatment in  the treated hemisphere compared to baseline. Conclusion: For the first time, it  is shown that bilateral FUS-induced BBB opening significantly and simultaneously  ameliorates both coexistent pathologies, which translated to improvements in  spatial memory of transgenic animals with complex AD, the human mimicking  phenotype. The level of cognitive improvement was significantly correlated with  the volume of BBB opening. Non-transgenic animals were also shown to exhibit  similar memory amelioration for the first time, indicating that BBB opening  results into benefits in the neuronal function regardless of the existence of AD  pathology. A potential mechanism of action for the reduction of the both  pathologies investigated was the cholesterol metabolism, specifically the LRP1b  receptor, which exhibited increased expression levels in transgenic mice  following FUS-induced BBB opening. Initial clinical evidence supported that the  beta amyloid reduction shown in rodents could be translatable to humans with  significant amyloid reduction shown in the treated hemisphere.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","4102-4120","","12","13","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","eng","© The author(s).","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 37554284  PMCID: PMC10405840","","","","*Alzheimer Disease/metabolism; Alzheimer's Disease; Amyloid beta and Tau; Amyloid beta-Peptides/metabolism; Animals; Blood-Brain Barrier Opening; Brain/metabolism; Disease Models, Animal; Drug-free therapy; Focused Ultrasound; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Spatial Memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used MRgFUS to  produce small lesions in the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM), an  important node in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical tremor network, in 13 patients  with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease or essential tremor. Significant tremor  alleviation in the target hand ensued (t(12) = 7.21, p < 0.001, two-tailed),  which was strongly associated with the functional reorganization of the brain's  hand region with the cerebellum (r = 0.91, p < 0.001, one-tailed). This  reorganization potentially reflected a process of normalization, as there was a  trend of increase in similarity between the hand cerebellar connectivity of the  patients and that of a matched, healthy control group (n = 48) after treatment.  Control regions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, default, and  frontoparietal networks, in comparison, exhibited no association with tremor  alleviation and no normalization. More broadly, changes in functional  connectivity were observed in regions belonging to the motor, limbic, visual, and  dorsal attention networks, largely overlapping with regions connected to the  lesion targets.

Focused ultrasound (FUS) can transiently, reversibly,  and locally open the BBB, while the effects of FUS combined with Exos-miRNA on  the treatment of glioma have not been explored to date. METHODS: Exos were  extracted by differential centrifugation and the efficacy of miR-1208-loaded Exos  combined with FUS in the treatment of glioma was detected by CCK-8, colony  formation, flow cytometry, transwell and tumour xenografts assays. The  METTL3-mediated regulation of IGF2BP2 on mRNA stability of NUP214 was determined  by MeRIP-qPCR, half-life and RIP assays. RESULTS: We used Exos secreted by  mesenchymal stem cells as carriers for the tumour suppressor gene miR-1208, and  following FUS irradiation, more Exos carrying miR-1208 were allowed to pass  through the BBB, and the uptake of miR-1208 in Exos by glioma cells was promoted,  thereby achieving high-efficiency tumour-suppressive effects. Furthermore, the  molecular mechanism underlying this effect was elucidated that miR-1208  downregulated the m(6)A methylation level of NUP214 mRNA by negatively regulating  the expression of METTL3, thereby NUP214 expression and TGF-β pathway activity  were suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-1208-loaded Exos combined with FUS is expected  to become an effective glioma treatment and deserves further clinical evaluation.","2023-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1083-1094","","7","129","","Br J Cancer","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

In preclinical studies,  FUS of the spleen (sFUS) activates an anti-inflammatory neural pathway which  suppresses acute and chronic inflammation. However, the relevance of sFUS for  regulating inflammatory responses in humans is unknown. Here, we used a modified  diagnostic ultrasound imaging system to target the spleen of healthy human  subjects with 3 min of continuously swept or stationary focused pulsed  ultrasound, delivered at three different energy levels within allowable safety  exposure limits. Potential anti-inflammatory effects of sFUS were assessed by  measuring sFUS-elicited changes in endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)  production in whole blood samples from insonified subjects. We found that  stimulation with either continuously swept or focused pulsed ultrasound has an  anti-inflammatory effect: sFUS lowers TNF production for >2 h, with TNF returning  to baseline by 24 h following sFUS. This response is independent of anatomical  target (i.e., spleen hilum or parenchyma) or ultrasound energy level. No  clinical, biochemical, or hematological parameters are adversely impacted. This  is the first demonstration that sFUS suppresses the normal inflammatory response  in humans, with potential implications for noninvasive bioelectronic therapy of  inflammatory disorders.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","703-711","","3","16","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023.

Magnetic resonance  image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS) has been shown to  control tremor efficaciously and with acceptable risk. To date, paresthesia and  ataxia are the most common adverse effects (AE). Nevertheless, the impact of  MRIgFUS thalamotomy on balance is not well established. METHODS: Thirty-two  patients underwent MRIgFUS for ET and completed 6 months of follow-up. Tremor  severity and functional disability were assessed using the Essential Tremor  Rating Scale and the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire. The Berg  Balance Scale (BBS) was applied to objectively measure balance status. RESULTS:  All treatments were successful. The sonication target was 1-2 mm above the depth  of the intercommissural line. Procedures lasted less the 2 h, with an average of  8 sonications per patient. Twenty-four patients were included in the tremor  analysis. The hand tremor score was improved by 76% after 6 months of follow-up  and 87% of patients self-reported marked improvement (≥75%). Disability scores  showed marked improvement (78%), leading to a significant improvement in quality  of life. At the final follow-up, 48% of the patients reported no side effects.  When present, AE were generally transient and were considered mild in 96% of  affected patients. Paresthesia and subjective feeling of unsteadiness were the  most common persistent complaints (23% and 20%, respectively). Regarding  objective ataxia, BBS scores remained stable throughout follow-up for most  patients. Only 2 patients suffered a mild worsening of balance although no  patients experienced moderate or severe ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective feeling  of unsteadiness is one of the most frequent AE after MRIgFUS, although objective  ataxia is infrequent and mild. Selecting the most appropriate lesion location and  procedural parameters should increase treatment benefits while reducing side  effects.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","12-21","","1","101","","Stereotact Funct Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 S.

In November 2019, the spectrum of alternative treatment for PCa was  added by a novel minimally invasive method, namely high-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU) using the latest Focal One machine (with the possibility of  combining intraoperative ultrasound and preoperative MRI data). MATERIALS AND  METHODS: During the period from November 2019 to November 2021, HIFU using Focal  One device (manufactured by EDAP, France) was performed in 75 patients with PCa.  Total ablation was done in 45 cases, while 30 patients undergone to focal  prostate ablation. The average age of the patients was 62.7 (51-80) years, the  total PSA level was 9.3 (3.2-15.5) ng/ml and the prostate volume was 32.0 (11-35)  cc. The maximum urinary rate was 13.3 (6.3-36) ml/s, IPSS score was 7 (3-25)  points, IIEF-5 score was 18 (4-25). Clinical stage c1N0M0 was diagnosed in 60  patients, 1bN0M0 in 4 patients, 2N0M0 in 11 patients. In 21 cases, transurethral  resection of the prostate was performed within 4-6 weeks prior to total ablation.  Before surgery, all patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the  pelvis with intravenous contrast and PIRADS V2 assessment. MRI data were used  intraoperatively for precision planning of the procedure. RESULTS: In all  patients, the procedure was performed under endotracheal anesthesia in accordance  with the technical recommendations of the manufacturer. Prior to surgery, a  silicone urethral catheter of 16 or 18 Ch was placed. The average duration of the  intervention was 101 (56-147) minutes. The postoperative period was uneventful in  all cases.Patients received antibiotic therapy via parenteral route for 4 days,  followed by oral administration for another 10 days, as well as alpha-blockers  (at least 1 month after procedure). After removal of urethral catheter on the 4th  day, all patients started to void. In 9 cases there was acute urinary retention  in the evening and in 4 patients in the next morning, requiring temporary bladder  catheterization. A year after the procedure, 53 patients were fully examined: the  average total PSA level in patients who underwent total ablation (n=53) was  0.96+/-0.11 ng/ml, the IPSS score was 6.9+/-0,6 points (no difference compared to  baseline). Follow-up biopsy revealed PCa in 6 patients; in other cases, prostate  fibrosis was determined. CONCLUSIONS: HIFU in patients with localized PCa using  image-guided robotic HIFU (Focal One) is promising and feasible. This method has  shown good oncological results with a short follow-up period. It is advisable to  carry out further prospective analysis.","2023-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","83-89","","2","","","Urologiia","","","","","","","","rus","","","","","","","Place: Russia (Federation) PMID: 37401710","","","","*Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy; *Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Robotic Surgical Procedures; *Transurethral Resection of Prostate; *Ultrasound, High-Intensity Focused, Transrectal; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Treatment Outcome; prostate cancer; ultrasound ablation of the prostate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results showed a significant 4.8-fold increase in MRI  contrast-enhancement volume in FUS-targeted regions compared to nontargeted  regions. FUS sonication enhanced aPD-L1 delivery by an average of 2.1-fold,  according to fluorescence imaging. In vivo MRI and ex vivo staining revealed that  the procedure did not cause significant acute tissue damage.

In this case report, we  describe the successful use of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as an  effective pretreatment method for surgical procedure in a patient with GTN to  reduce the perioperative risk and the impact on fertility. CASE PRESENTATION: A  26-year-old woman was diagnosed with high-risk GTN (FIGO Stage III: 12 prognostic  scores) after a hydatidiform mole. The fifth chemotherapy cycle was interrupted  due to severe chemotherapy toxicity. However, the uterine lesion was still  present and the beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level was not restored  to normal. Therefore, ultrasound-guided HIFU was performed as a pretreatment  method to shrink the lesion and prevent massive bleeding during localized lesion  resection. The effectiveness of ablation was evaluated immediately using  contrast-enhanced ultrasound and Color Flow Doppler ultrasonography. One month  after HIFU treatment, the uterine lesion was completely resected under  hysteroscopic surgery. During the surgery, HIFU was found to have shrunk the  lesion and there was minimal bleeding (5 mL). The uterine cavity morphology and  menstruation returned to normal after surgery. The patient has showed no signs of  recurrence as of one-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided HIFU ablation  may be a new choice for high-risk GTN patients with chemoresistance or  chemo-intolerance. As a noninvasive pretreatment method, HIFU can shrink the  uterine lesion, and reduce the risk of bleeding with no obvious effect on  fertility.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2192448","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36966804","","","","*Gestational Trophoblastic Disease/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Hydatidiform Mole/surgery; *Uterine Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/surgery/pathology; Adult; Female; Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia; Humans; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; fertility; high intensity focused ultrasound; hysteroscopic resection; noninvasive","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  acoustic output level and safety of ultrasound treatments are closely related to  the accuracy of sound pressure measurements. Heterodyne laser interferometry is  applied to the measurement of ultrasonic pressure owing to its characteristics of  non-contact, high precision, and traceability. However, the upper limit of sound  pressure measurement is limited by the bandwidth of the interferometer. In this  paper, a high-bandwidth heterodyne laser interferometer for the measurement of  high-intensity focused ultrasound pressure is developed and tested. The optical  carrier with a frequency shift of 358 MHz is realized by means of an  acousto-optic modulator. The selected electrical devices ensure that the  electrical bandwidth can reach 1.5 GHz. The laser source adopts an iodine  frequency-stabilized semiconductor laser with high-frequency spectral purity,  which can reduce the influence of spectral purity on the bandwidth to a  negligible level.

The use  of a four-tract probabilistic tractography technique, targeting the intersection  between the dentato-rubro-thalamic tracts (both decussating and non-decussating),  while evaluating the corticospinal tract and the medial lemniscus, may obtain  immediate clinical results with reduced adverse events. Our aim is to present our  experience with the four-tract technique for patients undergoing ET treatment  with MRgFUS. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospective database of  consecutive patients undergoing ET treatment in a single center from February  2022 to February 2023. Procedural parameters were collected, and tremor  improvement was assessed with the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) at  baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Adverse events were also reported. RESULTS:  Forty-three patients (median age, 72 years [interquartile range, 66-76]; 22  females) were evaluated. Tremor improved significatively in all CRST subsections  at 3 months, including the CRST part A + B treated hand tremor (22 [19-27] vs 4  [2-7], p < 0.001) and CRST part C (16 [13-19] vs 3 [1-4], p < 0.001). Differences  persisted significant at 6 months. Adverse events were few (4.1% of paresthesias  and 12.5% of objective gait disturbance at follow-up) and recorded as mild. The  median number of sonications was 7 [6-8] and mean operative time 68.7 ± 24.2 min.  CONCLUSION: Our data show support for the feasibility and benefits of systematic  targeting approach with four-tract probabilistic tractography for treating ET  using MRgFUS. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: An approach with four-tract  probabilistic tractography for treating essential tremor (ET) patients with  magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound decreases interindividual  variability with good clinical outcomes, low number of sonications, few adverse  effects, and short procedure times. KEY POINTS: • The optimal target for the  treatment of essential tremor with MR-guided focused ultrasound remains unknown.  • Four-tract probabilistic tractography is a feasible technique that reduces  interindividual variability, with good clinical results, few side effects, and  short operative time. • The four-tract tractography approach can be performed  using different MRI scanners and post-processing software in comparison with the  initial description of the technique.","2023-11-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

The luminol-O(2) ECL system suffers from a problem, that is, the conversion rate of dissolved O(2)  into reactive oxygen species (ROS) is low. In this work, we used high-intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU) pretreatment combined with Ti(3)C(2)-TiO(2) to  construct a highly sensitive luminol-O(2) ECL system for the specific detection  of polynucleotide kinase (PNK) first. On the one hand, HIFU generated ROS in situ  as a coreactant via the cavitation effect to boost the luminol emission. On the  other hand, Ti(3)C(2)-TiO(2) was prepared in situ via Ti(3)C(2) as a reducing  agent, and it can aggregate and catalyze ROS generated in situ by HIFU. Moreover,  the Ti on the Ti(3)C(2)-TiO(2) surface could bind to phosphate groups through  chelation, thereby realizing highly specific detection of PNK. The sensor has a  linear relationship range of 1.0 × 10(-5) to 10.0 U mL(-1), and the limit of  detection is 1.48 × 10(-7) U mL(-1), which is superior to most existing methods.

METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included 57 consecutive  patients with localised PCa. Aged 18-80 with ≤2 suspicious lesions on mpMRI  (PIRADS ≥ 3), PSA of ≤15 ng/mL, and an ISUP GG of ≤2. HIFU was performed between  November 2014 and September 2018. All men had an MRI/US fusion-guided targeted  biopsy (TB) combined with a TRUS-guided 10-core systematic biopsy (SB) prior to  focal therapy. HIFU treatment was performed as focal, partial, or hemiablative,  depending on the prior histopathology. Follow-up included Questionnaires (IIEF-5,  ICIQ, and IPSS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement, follow-up mpMRI,  and follow-up biopsies. RESULTS: The median age of the cohort was 72 years (IQR  64-76), and the median PSA value before HIFU was 7.3 ng/mL (IQR 5.75-10.39  ng/mL). The median follow-up was 27.5 (IQR 23-41) months. At the time of the  follow-up, the median PSA value was 2.5 ng/mL (IQR 0.94-4.96 ng/mL), which shows  a significant decrease (p < 0.001).

METHODS: Eighteen female rabbits were infused with isotonic sodium chloride  solution (ISCS), C118P or oxytocin for 30 min, and an HIFU ablation of the leg  muscles was performed within the last 2 min. Blood pressure, heart rate and laser  speckle flow imaging (LSFI) of the auricular blood vessels were recorded during  perfusion. Ears with vessels, uterus and muscle ablation sites were collected and  sliced for hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining to compare vascular size, as well as  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR) staining to  observe necrosis after ablation. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that the perfusion of  C118P or oxytocin steadily reduced blood perfusion in the ears to approximately  half by the end of the perfusion, constricted the blood vessels of the ears and  uterus, and improved HIFU ablation in the muscle tissues. C118P increased blood  pressure and decreased heart rate. The degree of contraction of the auricular and  uterine blood vessels was positively correlated. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed  that C118P could reduce blood perfusion in various tissues and had a better  synergistic effect with HIFU ablation of muscle (the same tissue type as  fibroids) than did oxytocin. C118P could therefore possibly replace oxytocin in  facilitating HIFU ablation of uterine fibroids; however, electrocardiographic  monitoring is required.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2185576","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36913972","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Leiomyoma/surgery; *Uterine Neoplasms/surgery; Animals; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Oxytocin; Rabbits; Treatment Outcome; Vascular disrupting agent; blood perfusion; high-intensity focused ultrasound; laser speckle flow imaging; vasoconstriction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acoustic simulations can estimate the pressure field when propagating through the  cranium but rely on accurately replicating the positioning of the transducer and  skull in a simulated space. Here, we develop and characterize the accuracy of a  workflow that creates simulation grids based on optical tracking information in a  neuronavigated phantom with and without transmission through an ex vivo skull  cap. The software pipeline could replicate the geometry of the tFUS procedure  within the limits of the optical tracking system (transcranial target  registration error (TRE): 3.9 ± 0.7 mm). The simulated focus and the free-field  focus predicted by optical tracking had low Euclidean distance errors of 0.5±0.1  and 1.2±0.4 mm for phantom and skull cap, respectively, and some skull-specific  effects were captured by the simulation. However, the TRE of simulation informed  by optical tracking was 4.6±0.2, which is as large or greater than the focal spot  size used by many tFUS systems. By updating the position of the transducer using  the original TRE offset, we reduced the simulated TRE to 1.1 ± 0.4 mm. Our study  describes a software pipeline for treatment planning, evaluates its accuracy, and  demonstrates an approach using MR-acoustic radiation force imaging as a method to  improve dosimetry. Overall, our software pipeline helps estimate acoustic  exposure, and our study highlights the need for image feedback to increase the  accuracy of tFUS dosimetry.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","146-156","","","3","","IEEE Open J Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38222464  PMCID: PMC10785958","","","","Acoustic simulations; optical tracking; transcranial focused ultrasound; ultrasound neuromodulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: FUS sonications were performed through skull phantoms  embedding agar-based tissue mimicking gels using a 1 MHz single-element  spherically focused transducer. The skull phantoms were 3D printed with  Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) and Resin thermoplastics having the exact  skull bone geometry of a healthy volunteer. The temperature field distribution  during and after heating was monitored in a 3 T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  scanner using MR thermometry. The effect of the skull's thickness on intracranial  heating was investigated. RESULTS: A single FUS sonication at focal acoustic  intensities close to 1580 W/cm(2) for 60 s in free field heated up the agar  phantom to ablative temperatures reaching about 90 °C (baseline of 37 °C). The  ABS skull strongly blocked the ultrasonic waves, resulting in zero temperature  increase within the phantom. Considerable heating was achieved through the Resin  skull, but it remained at hyperthermia levels. Conversely, tFUS through a 1 mm  Resin skull showed enhanced ultrasonic penetration and heating, with the focal  temperature reaching 70 °C. CONCLUSIONS: The ABS skull demonstrated poorer  performance in terms of tFUS compared to the Resin skull owing to its higher  ultrasonic attenuation and porosity. The thin Resin phantom of 1 mm thickness  provided an efficient acoustic window for delivering tFUS and heating up deep  phantom areas. The results of such studies could be particularly useful for  accelerating the establishment of a wider range of tFUS applications.","2023-07-30","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","J Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

The aim of this work was  to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of focal therapy versus prostatectomy and  external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov cohort health  state transition model with four health states (stable disease, local recurrence,  metastatic disease and death) was created, evaluating costs and utilities over a  10-year time horizon for patients diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer.  National Health Service (NHS) for England perspective was used, based on direct  healthcare costs. Clinical transition probabilities were derived from prostate  cancer registries in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, EBRT and focal  therapy using cryotherapy (Boston Scientific) or high-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU) (Sonablate). Propensity score matching was used to ensure that  at-risk populations were comparable. Variables included age, prostate-specific  antigen (PSA), International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group,  maximum cancer core length (mm), T-stage and year of treatment. RESULTS: Focal  therapy was associated with a lower overall cost and higher quality-adjusted life  year (QALY) gains than either prostatectomy or EBRT, dominating both treatment  strategies. Positive incremental net monetary benefit (NMB) values confirm focal  therapy as cost-effective versus the alternatives at a willingness to pay (WTP)  threshold of £30,000/QALY. One-way deterministic sensitivity analyses revealed  consistent results. LIMITATIONS: Data used to calculate the transition  probabilities were derived from a limited number of hospitals meaning that other  potential treatment options were excluded. Limited data were available on later  outcomes and none on quality of life data, therefore, literature-based estimates  were used. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness modelling demonstrates use of focal  therapy (cryotherapy or HIFU) is associated with greater QALY gains at a lower  overall cost than either radical prostatectomy or EBRT, representing good value  for money in the NHS.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1099-1107","","1","26","","J Med Econ","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37656223","","","","*Cost-Effectiveness Analysis; *Prostatic Neoplasms/radiotherapy/surgery; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Cost-effectiveness; Humans; I; I1; I10; I19; Male; Markov model; Prostatectomy; Quality of Life; State Medicine; cryotherapy; focal therapy; high-intensity focused ultrasound; propensity score matching; prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The histopathological injury of  the intestinal tissue and the expression of IL-1β, IL-18, caspase-recruitment  domain (ASC), cleaved caspase-1, gasdermin D (GSDMD), and NLRP3 of the CC tumors  were examined utilizing hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical  assay, and Western blot. RESULTS: FUS restrained the fluorescence intensity of  the tumors in orthotopic CC mice, while FUS-mediated suppression of the  bioluminescent signal of the tumors was alleviated by BAY11-7082. FUS was found  to relieve the injury of the intestinal tissues in CC mice as revealed by  morphology. Furthermore, the expressions of IL-1β, IL-18, GSDMD, ASC, cleaved  caspase-1, and NLRP3 of the CC tumors in the FUS group were higher than those in  the tumor group, while BAY11-7082 addition partly reversed the FUS's effects on  orthotopic CC model mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results pointed out that FUS presented  anti-tumor activity in experimental CC, and its mechanism was correlated with the  promotion of pyroptosis.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","47-55","","1","61","","Folia Histochem Cytobiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Poland PMID: 36880682","","","","*Colonic Neoplasms; *NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/metabolism; Animals; CT26-Luc cells; Caspases/metabolism/pharmacology; Interleukin-18/pharmacology; Mice; NLRP3; Pyroptosis; focused ultrasound; gasdermin D; orthotopic colon cancer; pyroptosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The BH lesion is  known to depend in size and shape on exposure parameters and mechanical  properties, structure and composition of tissue being treated. The aim of this  work was to advance the concept of BH dose by investigating quantitative  relationships between the parameters of the lesion, pulsing protocols, and  targeted tissue properties. A HIFU focus of a 1.5 MHz 256-element array driven by  power-enhanced Verasonics system was electronically steered along the grid within  12 × 4 × 12 mm volume to produce volumetric lesions in porcine liver (soft, with  abundant collagenous structures) and bovine myocardium (stiff, homogenous  cellular) ex vivo tissues with various pulsing protocols (1-10 ms pulses, 1-15  pulses per point). Quantification of the lesion size and completeness was  performed through serial histological sectioning, and a computer vision approach  using a combination of manual and automated detection of fully fractionated and  residual tissue based on neural network ResNet-18 was developed. Histological  sample fixation led to underestimation of BH ablation rate compared to the  ultrasound-based estimations, and provided similar qualitative feedback as did  gross inspection. This suggests that gross observation may be sufficient for  qualitatively evaluating the BH treatment completeness. BH efficiency in liver  tissue was shown to be insensitive to the changes in pulsing protocol within the  tested parameter range, whereas in bovine myocardium the efficiency increased  with either increasing pulse length or number of pulses per point or both. The  results imply that one universal mechanical dose metric applicable to an  arbitrary tissue type is unlikely to be established. The dose metric as a product  of the BH pulse duration and the number of pulses per sonication point (BHD1) was  shown to be more relevant for initial planning of fractionation of collagenous  tissues. The dose metric as a number of pulses per point (BHD2) is more suitable  for the treatment planning of softer targets primarily containing cellular  tissue, allowing for significant acceleration of treatment using shorter pulses.","2023-12-20","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","107225","","","138","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

However, therapies targeting Aβ have proven  insufficient in achieving disease reversal, prompting a shift to focus on early  intervention and alternative therapeutic targets. Focused ultrasound (FUS) paired  with systemically-introduced microbubbles (μB) is a non-invasive technique for  targeted and transient blood-brain barrier opening (BBBO), which has demonstrated  Aβ and tau reduction, as well as memory improvement in models of late-stage AD.  However, similar to drug treatments for AD, this approach is not sufficient for  complete reversal of advanced, symptomatic AD. Here we aim to determine whether  early intervention with FUS-BBBO in asymptomatic AD could delay disease onset.  Thus, the objective of this study is to measure the protective effects of  FUS-BBBO on anxiety, memory and AD-associated protein levels in female and male  triple transgenic (3xTg) AD mice treated at an early age and disease state. Here  we show that early, repeated intervention with FUS-BBBO decreased  anxiety-associated behaviors in the open field test by 463.02 and 37.42% in male  and female cohorts, respectively. FUS-BBBO preserved female aptitude for learning  in the active place avoidance paradigm, reducing the shock quadrant time by 30.03  and 31.01% in the final long-term and reversal learning trials, respectively.  Finally, FUS-BBBO reduced hippocampal accumulation of Aβ40, Aβ42, and total tau  in females by 12.54, 13.05, and 3.57%, respectively, and reduced total tau in  males by 18.98%. This demonstration of both cognitive and pathological protection  could offer a solution for carriers of AD-associated mutations as a safe,  non-invasive technique to delay the onset of the cognitive and pathological  effects of AD.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1229683","","","17","","Front Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Noel, Gorman, Batts and Konofagou.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37575309  PMCID: PMC10412991","","","","Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; anxiety; blood–brain barrier; focused ultrasound; long-term memory; spatial memory; tau","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we  retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of high-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU) as a local adjuvant therapy for systemic chemotherapy for  patients with unresectable CRLM. HIFU is a noninvasive method previously  demonstrated as efficacious for various solid malignancies. METHODS: Propensity  score matching was used for the combination therapy group (HIFU group, n = 59)  and the observation group receiving systemic therapy only (No-HIFU group,  n = 59). In addition, the survival benefit, adverse effects, and factors  affecting prognosis following HIFU were evaluated. RESULTS: The disease control  rate was 77.9% and 62.7%, and the objective remission rate was 18.9% and 6.8% in  the HIFU and non-HIFU groups, respectively. The survival analysis showed that  median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 12.0 months and 11.0 months for the  HIFU and non-HIFU groups, respectively (p = 0.002). The univariate and  multivariate analysis showed that pre-treatment colorectal cancer liver  metastasis lesion size was significantly associated with mPFS. In addition,  patients that received a combination treatment for CRLM lesions <5.0 cm had a  longer mPFS when compared to those receiving systemic therapy alone (13.0 months  vs. 11.0 months, p = 0.001). In the HIFU group, patients with lesions <5.0 cm had  a longer mPFS than patients with lesions ≥5.0 cm (13.0 months vs. 10.0 months,  p = 0.04) (Figure 3B,C). Most treatment-related adverse events observed in both  groups were grade 1-2. Only four cases (6.8%) of grade 1-2 skin burns were  observed in patients in the HIFU group; no other statistically significant  adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that HIFU ablation  targeting unresectable CRLM alongside systemic therapy safely and significantly  improved local control rates and prolonged mPFS, especially for lesions smaller  than 5.0 cm.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","21985-21995","","24","12","","Cancer Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

Gross and histological analyses were used to  characterize the ablation efficacy of the treatment, and routine  immunohistochemistry and batched cytokine analysis were used to investigate the  acute immunological effects of histotripsy. RESULTS: Results showed that  histotripsy ablation was achievable and well-tolerated in all three cats. Precise  cavitation bubble clouds were generated in all patients, and hematoxylin & eosin  stained tissues revealed ablative damage in targeted regions. Immunohistochemical  results identified an increase in IBA-1 positive cells in treated tissues, and no  significant changes in cytokine concentrations were identified post-treatment.

METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 20  patients underwent inferior turbinate surgery, which consisted of either HIFU or  coblation therapy. Efficacy, safety, and tolerability were evaluated by  subjective symptom scores, acoustic rhinometry, and nasal endoscopy. RESULTS: The  modified nasal obstruction symptom evaluation (NOSE) score and nasal obstruction  visual analog scale (NO-VAS) significantly decreased in both groups 12 weeks  postoperatively. The between-group differences in the evaluation scores were not  statistically significant. On nasal endoscopy, the HIFU patients showed  improvements in mucosal swelling sooner than the patients undergoing coblation  therapy. Nasal crusting significantly increased in the patients undergoing  coblation compared to the patients undergoing HIFU therapy until postoperative  week 4. Mucosal preservation was superior in the HIFU patients. Although HIFU was  less painful than coblation therapy during the procedure, the difference was not  significant (4.9 vs. 6.3, P=0.143). The difference in global satisfaction between  the two groups was not statistically significant, although satisfaction was  slightly higher among the HIFU patients than among the coblation patients (4.6  vs. 4.1, P=0.393). CONCLUSION: HIFU provided results similar to those of  coblation therapy for patients with nasal obstruction due to ITH, but HIFU  therapy caused less discomfort during the procedure.

METHODS/MATERIALS:  10 histotripsy SQ fat treatments were completed in 5 swine, divided into four  groups based on pre-determined survival: day 0 (n = 4), day 7 (n = 2), day 28  (n = 2), and day 56 (n = 2). A 4.0 × 4.0x2.0 cm ovoid treatment was created in  the fat pad of the posterior thorax. MRI of survived animals were obtained on day  7 (n = 6), day 28 (n = 4), and day 56 (n = 2), and reviewed for size and imaging  characteristics. Technical success was defined as the creation of a treatment  zone in the targeted SQ fat. Skin firmness and indentation were qualitatively  scored. RESULTS: Histotripsy had a 100% (10/10) technical success for creation of  SQ fat treatments. Mean treatment time was 35.5 min (range 35-36.5).

Although intracerebral hemorrhage has not been reported with MRgFUS thalamotomy  for the treatment of movement disorders, clinicians commonly interrupt active  blood thinning medications prior to the procedure or offer gamma knife  radiosurgery instead. However, MRgFUS uses focal thermoablation, and bleeding  risk is likely minimal. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of MRgFUS  thalamotomy in patients with essential tremor (ET) and tremor-dominant  Parkinson's disease (PD) without interrupting anticoagulant or antiplatelet  therapies. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective case series of all  patients with ET or PD undergoing MRgFUS from February 2019 through December 2022  (n = 96). Demographic variables and medications taken at the time of surgery were  obtained. Our primary outcome was the type and frequency of hemorrhagic  complications noted on the operative report or postoperative imaging. RESULTS:  The mean age of patients was 74.2 years, and 26% were female. Forty patients were  taking ≥1 antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications. No patient actively taking  anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapies had a hemorrhagic complication during or  &lt;48 h after the procedure. CONCLUSION: The frequency of intra- or  postoperative complications from MRgFUS was not higher in patients actively  taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapies relative to those who were not.  Our findings suggest that MRgFUS thalamotomy does not necessitate interrupting  anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapies. However, given the limited number of  patients actively taking these therapies in our cohort (n = 40), additional  testing in large, prospective studies should be conducted to further establish  safety.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","314-318","","5","101","","Stereotact Funct Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 S.

Peripheral nerve blockade using  traditional needle-based and local anesthetic-based techniques improves pain  outcomes for some patient populations but has shortcomings limiting use. These  limitations include its invasiveness, potential for local anesthetic systemic  toxicity, risk of infection with an indwelling catheter, and relatively short  duration of blockade compared with the period of pain after major injuries.  Focused ultrasound is capable of inhibiting the peripheral nervous system and has  potential as a pain management tool. However, investigations of its effect on  peripheral nerve nociceptive fibers in animal models of acute pain are lacking.  In an in vivo acute pain model, we investigated focused ultrasound's effects on  behavior and peripheral nerve structure. METHODS: Focused ultrasound was applied  directly to the sciatic nerve of rats just prior to a hindpaw incision; three  control groups (focused ultrasound sham only, hindpaw incision only, focused  ultrasound sham+hindpaw incision) were also included. For all four groups  (intervention and controls), behavioral testing (thermal and mechanical  hyperalgesia, hindpaw extension and flexion) took place for 4 weeks. Structural  changes to peripheral nerves of non-focused ultrasound controls and after focused  ultrasound application were assessed on days 0 and 14 using light microscopy and  transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Compared with controls, after focused  ultrasound application, animals had (1) increased mechanical nociceptive  thresholds for 2 weeks; (2) sustained increase in thermal nociceptive thresholds  for ≥4 weeks; (3) a decrease in hindpaw motor response for 0.5 weeks; and (4) a  decrease in hindpaw plantar sensation for 2 weeks. At 14 days after focused  ultrasound application, alterations to myelin sheaths and nerve fiber  ultrastructure were observed both by light and electron microscopy. DISCUSSION:  Focused ultrasound, using a distinct parameter set, reversibly inhibits A-delta  peripheral nerve nociceptive, motor, and non-nociceptive sensory fiber-mediated  behaviors, has a prolonged effect on C nociceptive fiber-mediated behavior, and  alters nerve structure. Focused ultrasound may have potential as a peripheral  nerve blockade technique for acute pain management. However, further  investigation is required to determine C fiber inhibition duration and the  significance of nerve structural changes.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","462-470","","9","48","","Reg Anesth Pain Med","","","","","","","","eng","© American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine 2023.

In conventional HMI, the amplitude-modulated FUS sequence and imaging  pulse are transmitted simultaneously. With this method, the high-amplitude FUS  signal must be separated from the imaging data for tissue displacement  estimation. Frequency domain notch filtering and bandpass filtering were  previously used to filter FUS interference from imaging data. However, FUS  interference becomes more pronounced at the increased intensities and durations  necessary for thermal ablation, rendering frequency domain filtering challenging.  In this study, three methods for FUS interference filtering during HMI-guided FUS  ablation (HMIgFUS) were compared. The methods were notch filtering; interleaved  HMIgFUS, with interleaved FUS and imaging pulses; and FUS-net, a convolutional  neural network-based U-Net autoencoder developed by our group for FUS  interference filtering in radiofrequency data. FUS-net was applied here for the  first time for the purpose of ablation displacement monitoring. METHODS: The  three filtering methods were tested during 20 HMIgFUS acquisitions in an ex vivo  canine liver using a range of peak positive pressures from 11 to 18 MPa and  durations ranging from 60 to 180 seconds. The B-mode mean squared errors (MSEs)  and displacement amplitude contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the three methods  were calculated and compared. RESULTS: The interleaved method for HMIgFUS was  found to be significantly robust in avoiding FUS interference in all tested cases  for FUS ablation monitoring, especially cases with high FUS pressure and long  durations, as opposed to traditional notch filtering and FUS-net filtering. CNRs  obtained from displacement amplitude maps in the interleaved data set were  significantly higher in all cases than those obtained from the notch filtered and  FUS-net data sets. There was not a significant trend in displacement CNR between  the FUS-net and notch filtered data sets. However, B-mode MSE was found to be  significantly higher when comparing the FUS-net and interleaved data sets as  opposed to the notch filtered and interleaved data sets, suggesting further  potential of FUS-net as an FUS interference filtering method. CONCLUSION: These  findings indicate the robustness of interleaved HMIgFUS in avoiding FUS  interference during HMIgFUS monitoring and the advantages, limitations and future  potential of FUS-net and notch filtering.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","119-127","","1","50","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

A significant proportion of patients will develop  biochemical failure after definitive radiotherapy and an increasing number of  local failures are now identifiable with prostate specific membrane antigen  (PSMA) positron emission tomography and computerized tomography (PET/CT).  Brachytherapy (BT) represents an excellent option for definitive local salvage  treatment. Consensus guidelines for the delivery of salvage BT are heterogenous  and limited. Herein, we report the results from a narrative review analyzing  whole gland and partial gland BT salvage to help guide treatment recommendations.  METHODS: The PubMed and MEDLINE databases were searched in October 2022 to  identify studies analyzing BT salvage in patients with recurrent prostate cancer  after definitive external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). 503 initial studies met  search criteria. After title and abstract screening, 25 studies met inclusion  criteria and full-text review was performed. Twenty studies were included for  analysis. Reports included whole gland (n=13) and partial gland or focal (n=7)  salvage BT. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: The median 5-year biochemical failure free  survival (BFFS) for men receiving whole gland BT salvage was 52%, which is  comparable to 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates for other salvage  treatment modalities (radical prostatectomy (RP) 54%, high-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU) 53%, cryotherapy 50%). However, the median rate of severe  genitourinary (GU) toxicity was lower (12%) compared to published rates for other  treatment modalities (RP 21%, HIFU 23%, and cryotherapy 15%). Furthermore,  patients receiving partial gland salvage BT had even lower median rates of grade  3 or higher GU toxicity (4% vs. 12%) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (0% vs.  3%), with 3-year BFFS of 58%. Only two studies directly comparing BT whole versus  partial gland salvage were identified with comprehensive literature search and  neither provided specific comparison regarding prescription dose or dose  constraints. CONCLUSIONS: This narrative review identified only two studies that  directly compared whole versus partial gland BT salvage treatment. Neither report  provided a specific comparison of recommendations for dosimetric technique or  normal structure dose constraints. Therefore, this review highlights a  significant gap in the existing literature and provides an important framework to  guide radiation treatment (RT) recommendations for both whole gland and partial  gland salvage BT in patients with recurrent prostate cancer.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","26","","3","12","","Chin Clin Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: China PMID: 37417290","","","","*Brachytherapy/methods; *Prostatic Neoplasms/radiotherapy; Humans; Male; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/radiotherapy; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prostate; Prostate cancer; Salvage Therapy/methods; brachytherapy (BT); focal; recurrence; salvage; whole gland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men with two or fewer lesions of grade  group (GG) ≤3 PCa were eligible for participation. Additional criteria included a  prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of ≤15 ng/mL, clinical T1c-T2, and a life  expectancy of ≥10 years. The primary endpoint was failure-free survival (FFS),  defined as absence of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) in- or out-of-field on  protocol-mandated saturation biopsy, no whole-gland or systemic salvage  treatment, PCa metastasis, or PCa-related death. Results are reported using two  distinct definitions of csPCa: (i) the presence of any GG ≥2 and (ii) any GG ≥3  or core involvement of ≥6 mm. Secondary endpoints were functional  patient-reported outcome measures addressing urinary, sexual, and bowel function.  RESULTS: A total of 91 patients were included: six (7%) with GG1 and 85 (93%)  with GG ≥2. In all, 83 (91%) underwent at least one follow-up biopsy. Biopsy  attendance at 6, 12, and 36 months was 84%, 67%, and 51%, respectively. The FFS  at these time points for any GG ≥2 PCa was 79% (95% confidence interval [CI]  80-88%), 57% (95% CI 48-69%) and 44% (95% CI 34-56%), respectively. Using the  second definition, FFS were 88% (95% CI 81-95%), 70% (95% CI 61-81%) and 65% (95%  CI 55-77%), respectively. The 3-year cancer-specific survival was 100%, and  freedom from metastasis was 99%. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (negative  predictive value of up to 89%, 95% CI 84-93%) and relative decrease of PSA values  (P = 0.4) performed poorly in detecting residual disease. Urinary and bowel  assessment returned to baseline questionnaire scores within 3 months. In all, 17  (21%) patients reported meaningful worsening in erectile function. A significant  decrease of PCa related anxiety was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Focal HIFU treatment  for localised PCa shows excellent functional outcomes with half of the patients  remaining cancer-free after 3 years. Whole-gland treatment was avoided in 81%.  Early follow-up biopsies are crucial to change or continue the treatment modality  at the right time, while the use of MRI and PSA in detecting PCa recurrence is  uncertain.","2023-10-27","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","BJU Int","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 BJU International.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37897088","","","","focal therapy; high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation; image-guided surgery; prostate cancer; treatment outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Minimally invasive interventions such as  ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU) are gaining  popularity as they avoid surgical morbidity and conserve the uterus. We present a  single-center experience on the use of USgHIFU for the treatment of fibroids and  adenomyosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 167  patients who underwent USgHIFU for uterine fibroids and adenomyosis between July  2018 and December 2020. Relevant demographic data and pre- and post-intervention  fibroid volume, symptom severity scores (SSS), and health-related quality of life  (QOL) scores were collected and compared. The paired t-test or Wilcoxon  signed-rank test was used to compare the difference before and after treatment. P  < 0.001 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: One hundred and  sixty-seven patients with fibroids or adenomyosis were included in this study.  The mean age of the cohort was 42-year-old. USgHIFU treatment led to a reduction  in mean fibroid volume, improvement in SSS, and health-related QOL scores. The  average reduction in mean fibroid volume was 68% and 75% at 6 and 12 months,  respectively. There was a significant reduction in SSS (46.9 [pre] vs. 15.6  [post], P < 0.001) and improvement in health-related QOL scores at 6 months (58  [pre] vs. 86 [post], P < 0.001). The re-intervention rate following USgHIFU was  7.7% and successful pregnancy post USgHIFU was reported in 6 patients.  CONCLUSION: USgHIFU is safe and effective. In women who desire fertility or are  not suitable for surgery, it is a good alternative option. It should be included  in the armamentarium for the treatment of uterine fibroids and adenomyosis.","2023-03","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","15-25","","1","12","","Gynecol Minim Invasive Ther","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright: © 2023 Gynecology and Minimally Invasive Therapy.","","","","","","Place: India PMID: 37025438  PMCID: PMC10071864","","","","High-intensity focused ultrasound; noninvasive; ultrasound; ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound; uterine fibroid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ex vivo bovine deep digital  flexor tendons were obtained (n = 4), and varying formulations of polyacrylamide  (PA), collagen and fibrin hydrogels (n = 3 each) were fabricated. Axial sound  speeds were measured at 1 MHz for calculation of anisotropy. All samples were  treated with a 1.5-MHz focused ultrasound transducer with 10-ms pulses repeated  at 1 Hz (p(+) = 127 MPa, p(-) = 35 MPa); treatments were monitored with passive  cavitation imaging and high-speed photography.

Histotripsy  is a focused ultrasound therapy under development for tissue ablation via bubble  activity. The goal of this study was to assess outcomes of histotripsy ablation  in a xenograft model of high-risk NB. METHODS: Female NCr nude mice received  NGP-luciferase cells intrarenally. Under ultrasound image guidance, histotripsy  pulses were applied over a distance of 4-6 mm within the tumors. Bioluminescence  indicative of tumor viability was quantified before, immediately after, and 24 h  after histotripsy exposure. Tumors were immunostained to assess apoptosis  (TUNEL), endothelium (endomucin), pericytes (αSMA), hypoxia (pimonidazole),  vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and platelet-derived growth  factor-B (PDGF-B). The apoptotic cytokine TNFα and its downstream effector  cleaved caspase-3 (c-casp-3) were assessed with SDS-PAGE. RESULTS: Histotripsy  induced a 50% reduction in bioluminescence compared to untreated controls, with  an absence of nuclei in the treatment core surrounded by a dense rim of  TUNEL-positive cells. Tumor regions not targeted by histotripsy also showed an  increase in TUNEL staining density. Increased apoptosis in histotripsy samples  was consistent with increases in TNFα and c-casp-3 relative to controls. Treated  tumors exhibited a decrease in hypoxia, VEGF, PDGF-B, and pericyte coverage of  vasculature compared to control samples. Further, increases in vasodilation were  found in histotripsy-treated specimens. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to ablative  effects, histotripsy was found to drive tumor apoptosis through intrinsic  pathways, altering blood vessel architecture, and reducing hypoxia.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2222941","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37344380","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Neuroblastoma/therapy; Animals; Apoptosis; Female; Heterografts; Histotripsy; Humans; Hypoxia; Mice; Mice, Nude; PDGFB; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; VEGF; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; apoptosis; hypoxia; neuroblastoma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Seventy-seven patients  using Sonablate(®) HIFU for localized prostate cancer were enrolled in this study  from April 2021 to December 2022. Prostate-specific antigen biochemical  recurrence, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 scores,  International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QoL) scores, and  postoperative complications were recorded during follow-up. RESULTS: Overall,  19.5% of patients were low-risk, 36.4% were intermediate-risk, and 44.1% were  high-risk according to the D'Amico risk classification. The median follow-up was  12.09 ± 5.85 months, and the biochemical-free survival rates for the low-,  intermediate-, and high-risk groups were 100% (15/15), 96.4% (27/28), and 79.4%  (27/34), respectively. Four patients (5.2%) received salvage radiotherapy and all  maintained biochemical-free survival. The mean IPSS and QoL scores before versus  after HIFU were 10.4 versus 6.8 (p = 0.003) and 3.2 versus 3.0 (p = 0.096),  respectively. There was no statistically significant change in preoperative and  postoperative IIEF scores (20.6 vs. 19; p = 0.062) in patients who had an IIEF  score of >15 at baseline and received nerve-sparing procedures (subtotal  ablation).

However, whether the effect of HIFU  is comparable with that of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has not been  determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of  Science, WanFang Data, CqVip, CNKI, and CBM databases were searched for  randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies.  The methodological quality of each study was evaluated. When there is no  statistical heterogeneity, the fixed effect model would be used to merge data.  Otherwise, the random effect model would be utilized. Sensitivity analyses were  conducted by excluding one study each time. Subgroup analyses were conducted  based on age, sex, tumor number, relative number of the patients with Child-Pugh  C grade in each group, the percentage of patients with Child-Pugh C grade in the  whole study, and tumor load. Publication bias was evaluated by Egger's test and  Begg's test. RESULTS: Six cohort studies including 188 patients from HIFU group  and 224 patients from TACE group were obtained for further analysis. The  meta-analysis suggested HIFU and TACE showed no differences in postoperative  1-year overall survival (OS) rate, tumor response (including complete response,  partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease), and postoperative  complications. Moreover, compared with TACE, HIFU showed higher postoperative  6-month and 2-year OS rates. Subgroup analyses, meta regression analysis and  sensitivity analyses indicated the findings above were reliable. Additionally, no  potential publication bias was detected. CONCLUSION: For HCC, when compared with  TACE, HIFU might show comparable safety but better effect. Considering the  limitations of current studies, more well-designed studies are needed to validate  our conclusion.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1879-1889","","12","99","","Int J Radiat Biol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37523652","","","","*Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/diagnostic imaging/therapy/pathology; *Chemoembolization, Therapeutic/adverse effects; *Liver Neoplasms/pathology; Cohort Studies; High-intensity focused ultrasound; Humans; Treatment Outcome; effect; hepatocellular carcinoma; meta-analysis; transarterial chemoembolization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current treatments, like dry needling,  induce microdamage to promote healing but produce mixed success rates.  Previously, we showed focused ultrasound can noninvasively create microdamage  while preserving mechanical properties in ex vivo murine tendons. This present  study compared growth factor, histological, and mechanical effects after focused  ultrasound or dry needling treatments in an in vivo murine tendon injury model.  Partial Achilles tenotomy was performed in 26 rats. One-week postsurgery, tendons  were treated with focused ultrasound (1.5 MHz, 1-ms pulses at 10 Hz for 106 s,  p(+)  = 49 MPa, p(-)  = 19 MPa) or dry needling (30 G needle, 5 fenestrations  over 20 s) and survived for 1 additional week. Blood was collected immediately  before and after treatment and before euthanasia; plasma was assayed for growth  factors. Treated tendons and contralateral controls were harvested for histology  or mechanical testing. No differences were found between treatments in release of  insulin growth factor 1 and transforming growth factor beta; vascular endothelial  growth factor A concentrations were too low for detection. Histologically,  focused ultrasound and dry needling tendons displayed localized fibroblast  infiltration without collagen proliferation with no detectable differences  between treatments. Mechanically, stiffness and percent relaxation of dry  needling tendons were lower than controls (p = 0.0041, p = 0.0441, respectively),  whereas stiffness and percent relaxation of focused ultrasound tendons were not  different from controls. These results suggest focused ultrasound should be  studied further to determine how this modality can be leveraged as a therapy for  tendinopathies.","2023-10-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","J Orthop Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

Due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier, the effects of chemotherapy have been unsatisfactory. The  combination of focused ultrasound and microbubbles to reversibly open the  blood-brain barrier is now considered a key factor in improving treatment  outcomes of glioblastoma. In this study, we developed bionic drug delivery  microbubbles, which in combination with focused ultrasound had an obvious  inhibitory effect on glioblastoma. We extracted the brain microvascular cell  membranes, combined them with lipid components, and loaded them with  superparamagnetic iron oxide and doxorubicin to prepare biomimetic drug delivery  microbubbles (FeDOX@cellMBs). We demonstrated that FeDOX@cellMBs retained the  intrinsic properties of loading, such as magnetic properties and drug toxicity,  both in vitro and in vivo. FeDOX@cellMBs exhibited good tumor targeting and  uptake under the combined action of magnetic and focused ultrasound. Importantly,  the FeDOX@cellMBs demonstrated excellent internal stability and effectively  inhibited tumor growth in orthotopic glioblastoma mice. Finally, organ H&E  staining confirmed that FeDOX@cellMBs were safe for use. In conclusion,  FeDOX@cellMBs successfully penetrated the blood-brain barrier and effectively  inhibited glioblastoma growth under the combined effects of focused ultrasound  and magnetic stimulation. These results provide a new approach for the treatment  of glioblastoma, with implications for future clinical translation.","2023-08-26","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","297","","1","21","","J Nanobiotechnology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-tumor-bearing pigs (n = 8; mean  weight, 52.5 kg) were anticoagulated with warfarin (initial dose, 0.08 mg/kg) to  a target prothrombin time (PT) of 30%-50% above baseline. A total of 15  histotripsy procedures were performed (kidney: n = 8, 2.0-cm sphere; liver: n =  7, 2.5-cm sphere). Treatments were immediately followed by computed tomography  (CT) imaging. Animals were observed for 7 days while continuing anticoagulation,  followed by repeat CT and necropsy. RESULTS: All animals survived to complete the  entire protocol with no signs of disability or distress. Three animals had  hematuria (pink urine without clots). Baseline PT values (mean, 16.0 seconds)  were elevated to 22.0 seconds (37.5% above baseline, P = .003) on the day of  treatment and to 28.8 seconds (77.8% above baseline, P < .001) on the day of  necropsy. At the time of treatment, 5 of 8 (63%) animals were at a therapeutic  anticoagulation level, and all 8 animals (100%) reached therapeutic levels by the  time of necropsy. There were no cases of intraparenchymal, peritoneal, or  retroperitoneal hemorrhage associated with any treatments despite 5 of 7 (71%)  liver and all 8 (100%) kidney treatments extending to the organ surface.  CONCLUSIONS: Liver and kidney histotripsy seems safe with no elevated bleeding  risk in this anticoagulated animal model, supporting the possibility of  histotripsy treatments in patients on anticoagulation.","2023-03","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","386-394.e2","","3","34","","J Vasc Interv Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 SIR.

Our aim was to bridge this gap by investigating and correlating MRI with  histological analysis after histotripsy treatment of mouse brain with and without  brain tumors and evaluating the evolution of the histotripsy ablation zone on MRI  over time. METHODS: An eight-element, 1 MHz histotripsy transducer with a focal  distance of 32.5 mm was used to treat orthotopic glioma-bearing mice and normal  mice. The tumor burden at the time of treatment was ∼5 mm(3). T2, T2*, T1 and  T1-gadolinium (Gd) MR images and histology of the brain were acquired on days 0,  2 and 7 for tumor-bearing mice and days 0, 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-histotripsy  for normal mice. RESULTS: T2 and T2* sequences most accurately correlated with  histotripsy treatment zone. The treatment-induced blood products, T1 along with  T2, revealed blood product evolution from oxygenated, de-oxygenated blood and  methemoglobin to hemosiderin. And T1-Gd revealed the state of the blood-brain  barrier arising from the tumor or histotripsy ablation. Histotripsy leads to  minor localized bleeding, which resolves within the first 7 d as evident on  hematoxylin and eosin staining. By day 14, the ablation zone could be  distinguished only by the macrophage-laden hemosiderin, which resides around the  ablation zone, rendering the treated zone hypo-intense on all MR sequences.  CONCLUSION: These results provide a library of radiological features on MRI  sequences correlated to histology, thus allowing for non-invasive evaluation of  histotripsy treatment effects in in vivo experiments.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1882-1891","","8","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

The last two decades have seen a  growing body of preclinical and clinical literature supporting the capacity of  FUS to increase nascent immune responses to tumors and to potentiate cancer  immunotherapies (e.g. checkpoint inhibitors) through a variety of means,  including immune modulation and drug delivery. With the rapid acceleration of  this field and a multitude of FUS immunotherapy clinical trials having now been  deployed worldwide, there is a need to streamline and standardize the methodology  for immunological analyses field-wide. Recently, the Focused Ultrasound  Foundation and Cancer Research Institute partnered to convene a group of over 85  leaders to discuss the nexus of FUS and immuno-oncology. The guidelines  documented herein were assembled in response to recommendations that emerged from  this discussion, emphasizing the urgent need for heightened accessibility of  immune analysis methods and standardized protocols unique to the field. These  guidelines are designated for existing stakeholders in the FUS immuno-oncology  domain or those newly entering the field, to provide guidance on collection,  storage, and immunological profiling of tissue or blood specimens in the context  of FUS immunotherapy studies, and additionally offer templates for standardized  deployment of these methods based on collective experience gained within the  field to date. These guidelines are tumor-agnostic and provide evidence-based,  consensus-based recommendations for both preclinical and clinical immune analysis  of tissue and blood specimens.","2023-11-24","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","11","11","","J Immunother Cancer","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis  of 54 studies containing 12,367 patients was conducted to compare the pregnancy  outcomes of three fertility-sparing therapies. And a retrospective self-control  study of 26 patients with uterine fibroids from May 2019 to December 2020 was  performed to assess the blood flow impedance of bilateral uterine arteries before  and after HIFU. RESULTS: In the analysis by treatment option, the pregnancy rate  after myomectomy was 0.43 (95% CI 0.36-0.49), which was higher than 0.18 (95% CI  0.10-0.26) after HIFU, the latter was significantly higher than that after UAE  (ratio 0.08, 95% CI 0.06-0.10). The miscarriage rate after HIFU was 0.08 (95% CI  0.04-0.12), which was similar to 0.15 (95% CI 0.09-0.21) after myomectomy and  also similar to 0.16 after UAE (95% CI 0.01-0.30). In the subgroup analysis,  women who received ultrasound guided HIFU (USgHIFU) were more likely to have  ideal pregnancy outcomes than that after magnetic resonance imaging-guided HIFU.

Despite success in several immunogenic  tumor types evidenced by improved survival, ICB remains largely unresponsive,  especially in ""cold tumors"" with poor lymphocyte infiltration. In addition, side  effects such as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are also obstacles for the  clinical translation of ICB. Recent studies have shown that focused ultrasound  (FUS), a non-invasive technology proven to be effective and safe for tumor  treatment in clinical settings, could boost the therapeutic effect of ICB while  alleviating the potential side effects. Most importantly, the application of FUS  to ultrasound-sensitive small particles, such as microbubbles (MBs) or  nanoparticles (NPs), allows for precise delivery and release of genetic  materials, catalysts and chemotherapeutic agents to tumor sites, thus enhancing  the anti-tumor effects of ICB while minimizing toxicity. In this review, we  provide an updated overview of the progress made in recent years concerning ICB  therapy assisted by FUS-controlled small-molecule delivery systems. We highlight  the value of different FUS-augmented small-molecules delivery systems to ICB and  describe the synergetic effects and underlying mechanisms of these combination  strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of the current strategies and  the possible ways that FUS-mediated small-molecule delivery systems could boost  novel personalized ICB treatments for solid tumors.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1169608","","","14","","Front Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Wu, Xia, Xiong, Duan, Pang, Zhang, Tang, Su, Wen, Mei, Cannon, Ji and Ou.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37180717  PMCID: PMC10173311","","","","focused ultrasound; immune checkpoint blockade; microbubbles; nanoparticles; small-molecule delivery systems; solid tumors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose To compare safety and effectiveness data of  MRI-guided focused ultrasound and EBRT in the treatment of bone metastases.  Materials and Methods Participants with painful bone metastases, excluding skull  and vertebral bodies, were enrolled in a prospective open-label nonrandomized  phase II study between January 2017 and May 2019 and underwent either MRI-guided  focused ultrasound or EBRT. The primary end point was the overall response rate  at 1-month following treatment, assessed via the numeric rating scale (NRS) for  pain (0-10 scale, with zero meaning ""no pain"" and 10 meaning ""the worst pain  imaginable""). Secondary end points were improvements at 12-month follow-up in NRS  and quality of life (QoL) measures, including the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI),  QoL-Questionnaire Cancer-15 Palliative Care (QLQ-C15-PAL), and QoL-Questionnaire  Bone Metastases-22 (QLQ-BM22) and analysis of adverse events. Statistical  analyses, including linear regression, χ(2) test, and Student t test followed the  per-protocol principle. Results Among 198 participants, 100 underwent MRI-guided  focused ultrasound (mean age, 63 years ± 13 [SD]; 51 women), and 98 underwent  EBRT (mean age, 65 years ± 14; 52 women). The overall response rates at 1-month  follow-up were 91% (91 of 100) and 67% (66 of 98), respectively, in the focused  ultrasound and EBRT arms (P < .001), and complete response rates were 43% (43 of  100) and 16% (16 of 98) (P < .001). The mean baseline NRS score was 7.0 ± 2.1 for  focused ultrasound and 6.6 ± 2.4 for EBRT (P = .16); at 1-month follow-up, they  were reduced to 3.2 ± 0.3 and 5.1 ± 0.3 (P < .001), respectively. QLQ-C15-PAL for  physical function (P = .002), appetite (P < .001), nausea and vomiting (P <  .001), dyspnea (P < .001), and QoL (P < .001) scores were lower in the focused  ultrasound group. The overall adverse event rates were 15% (15 of 100) after  focused ultrasound and 24% (24 of 98) after EBRT.

Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a non-invasive tool for BBB breaching,  tumor ablation, enhancing drug delivery, promoting the release of tumor  biomarkers for liquid biopsy, or the tumor microenvironment disruption. This  paper presents a comprehensive review of the current literature related to FUS  and its application in the treatment of brain metastasis. METHODS: This review of  the current literature via PubMed, Google Scholar, and Clincaltrials.gov focused  on clinical trials in which FUS is used in the intracranial treatment of  metastatic tumor, glioma, or GBM. RESULTS: FUS is safe and effective for  treatment of primary or metastatic brain tumors. FUS-augmented drug delivery can  open BBB to facilitate the transport of chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapies,  and targeted treatments. The integration of FUS with liquid biopsy has  considerable potential for early tumor detection, precise gene profiling, and  personalized therapy. Sonodynamic therapy can induce tumor cell apoptosis and  could potentially be used to enhance the outcomes of other tumor treatments, such  as surgery and chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Further work is required to establish  FUS as a standard therapy for BMs. FUS has the potential to transform brain tumor  treatment, particularly when combined with immunotherapy and targeted therapy as  a non-invasive alternative to surgery and radiation therapy.","2023-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","53-62","","1","165","","J Neurooncol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Histotripsy is a  form of mechanical HIFU that can initiate and interact with bubble(s) to cause  shock scattering and perhaps atomization within the bubble(s) to fractionate most  soft tissues. Ultrasonic atomization, or the ejection of fine droplets from an  acoustically-excited liquid exposed to air, has been shown to erode planar soft  tissue surfaces, which has led to theories that atomization is a mechanism in  histotripsy. However, healthy tendons show resistance to conventional  histotripsy; pre-treatment of tendons with heat increases susceptibility to  histotripsy fractionation. This study investigates ultrasonic atomization and  erosion from planar healthy and tendinopathic tendon surfaces as we evaluate HIFU  parameters for histotripsy in tendons.Approach.Forty-sixex vivobovine tendon-air  interfaces were pre-conditioned to surface wetting, heat baths of 20 °C  (unaltered), 37 °C (body temperature), and 58 °C (collagen degradation),  collagenase soaks for 1, 3, 5, and 24 h (mimicking tendinopathic tendons), and  phosphate buffered saline soaks for 24 h. Ejected fragments, histology, and gross  analysis determined erosion success. Tissue displacement from the HIFU radiation  force was monitored with high-speed photography, and tissue relaxation was  pixel-tracked and fit to a Kelvin-Voigt model to evaluate changes in viscoelastic  properties.Main results.Results showed that atomization produced holes in 24 h  collagenase tendons and surface pitting in 58 °C, 3 h, and 5 h collagenase  tendons. Increased mound heights and viscoelastic constants in pre-heated (to 58  °C) and collagenase-soaking (3+ hours) tendinopathic models caused a decrease in  elasticity and/or increase in viscosity, increasing susceptibility to erosion by  HIFU atomization.Significance.Therefore, tendons with chronic tendinopathies may  be more susceptible than healthy tendons to histotripsy fractionation.","2023-01-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","2","68","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36595243  PMCID: PMC10122516","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; Elasticity; HIFU; Hot Temperature; Tendons/diagnostic imaging; Ultrasonics; atomization; collagenase; histotripsy; tendinopathy; tendon; therapeutic ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total of 20 patients with 101 multiple FAs were enrolled. After  one session FUAS ablation, 21 lesions (≥15.0 mm) were surgically removed within  one week for histopathological analysis, including 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium  chloride (TTC) staining, H&E staining, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)  -flavretin enzyme staining, Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning  electron microscope (SEM). The remaining 80 lesions were followed up at 3, 6 and  12 months after treatment. RESULTS: All ablation procedures were performed  successfully. Pathologic findings showed that irreversible damage of FA was  confirmed. TTC, H&E and NADH staining and TEM/SEM demonstrated tumor cell death  and tumor structural destruction at the gross, cellular, and subcellular levels,  respectively. The median shrinkage rate at 12 months post-FUAS was 66.4 (43.6,  89.5) %.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment increases collagen  synthesis, rejuvenating skin. Using H(2)O(2)-induced senescent fibroblasts and  the skin of 12-month-old mice, we tested the hypothesis that HIFU increases  collagen production through Cav-1 modulation. HIFU was administered at 0.3, 0.5,  or 0.7 J in the LINEAR and DOT modes. In both models, HIFU administration  decreased Cav-1 levels, increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and decreased the  binding of Cav-1 with both MDM2 and Sirt1. HIFU administration decreased p53  activation (acetylated p53) and p21 levels and increased cyclin D1,  cyclin-dependent kinase 2, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels in both  models.

The advancement of transducer technology has paved the way  for dermatological applications. A comprehensive review is presented for  healthcare practitioners and researchers, summarizing the effect of various  operational parameters on the injury zone produced by ultrasound beams for  various dermatological applications, which include skin tightening, fat  reduction, hyperpigmentation and cancer treatment. In this article, we aim to  highlight the efficient operational parameters of FUS to enhance pain relief  during surgery and its affordability for skin treatment. Finally, a prospective  future technique for efficient FUS is discussed.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","8-17","","1","50","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

However, ionizing radiation has adverse short and long-term side  effects which have resulted in treatment complications for decades. Thus,  advances in enhancing the effects of RT have been the primary focus of research  in radiation oncology. To avoid the usage of high radiation doses, treatment  modalities such as high-intensity focused ultrasound can be implemented to reduce  the radiation doses required to destroy cancer cells. In the past few years, the  use of focused ultrasound (FUS) has demonstrated immense success in a number of  applications as it capitalizes on spatial specificity. It allows ultrasound  energy to be delivered to a targeted focal area without harming the surrounding  tissue. FUS combined with RT has specifically demonstrated experimental evidence  in its application resulting in enhanced cell death and tumor cure.  Ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles have recently proved to be a novel way of  enhancing RT as a radioenhancing agent on its own, or as a delivery vector for  radiosensitizing agents such as oxygen. In this mini-review article, we discuss  the bio-effects of FUS and RT in various preclinical models and highlight the  applicability of this combined therapy in clinical settings.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","15330338231176376","","","22","","Technol Cancer Res Treat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37192751  PMCID: PMC10192668","","","","*Neoplasms/radiotherapy; *Radiation Oncology; Cell Death; Humans; Microbubbles; Ultrasonography; acid sphingomyelinase; ceramide; focused ultrasound; radiation therapy; ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This procedure selectively destroys a targeted volume of cerebral  tissue and relies on real-time MR thermography to monitor tissue temperatures. By  focusing on a submillimeter target through a hemispheric phased array of  transducers, ultrasound waves pass through the skull and avoid overheating and  brain damage. High-intensity focused ultrasound techniques are increasingly used  to create safe and effective stereotactic ablations for medication-refractory  movement and other neurologic and psychiatric disorders.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","301-310","","2","34","","Neurosurg Clin N Am","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.
