Histotripsy, a focused ultrasound therapy, uses the mechanical activity of bubble  clouds to liquefy target tissues. In vitro experiments have shown that  histotripsy enhances thrombolytic agent recombinant tissue plasminogen activator  in a highly retracted clot model resistant to lytic therapy alone. Although these  results are promising, further refinement of the acoustic source is necessary for  in vivo studies and clinical translation. The source parameters for use in vivo  were defined, and a transducer was fabricated for transcutaneous exposure of  porcine and human iliofemoral deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) as the target. Based on  the design criteria, a 1.5-MHz elliptical source with a 6-cm focal length and a  focal gain of 60 was selected. The source was characterized by fiber-optic  hydrophone and holography. High-speed photography showed that the cavitation  cloud could be confined to dimensions smaller than the specified vessel lumen.  The source was also demonstrated in vitro to create confined lesions within  clots. The results support that this design offers an appropriate clinical  prototype for combined histotripsy-thrombolytic therapy.","2022-01","2024-03-06 17:03:31","2024-03-06T17:03:31Z","","156-165","","1","69","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 34534078  PMCID: PMC8802531","","","","*Fibrinolytic Agents; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; Animals; Humans; Swine; Thrombolytic Therapy; Tissue Plasminogen Activator; Transducers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, visualization of the NPV first  requires an injection of MRI contrast agents into the bloodstream, which has many  downsides. Purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning model capable of  predicting the NPV immediately after prostate ablation therapy without the need  for MRI contrast agents. A modified 2D deep learning UNet model was developed to  predict the post-treatment NPV. MRI imaging data from 95 patients who had  previously undergone prostate ablation therapy for treatment of localized  prostate cancer were used to train, validate, and test the model. Model inputs  were T1/T2-weighted and thermometry MRI images, which were always acquired  without any MRI contrast agents and prior to the final NPV image on  treatment-day. Model output was the predicted NPV. Model accuracy was assessed  using the Dice-Similarity Coefficient (DSC) by comparing the predicted to ground  truth NPV. A radiologist also performed a qualitative assessment of NPV. Mean  (std) DSC score for predicted NPV was 85% ± 8.1% compared to ground truth. Model  performance was significantly better for slices with larger prostate radii  (> 24 mm) and for whole-gland rather than partial ablation slices. The predicted  NPV was indistinguishable from ground truth for 31% of images. Feasibility of  predicting NPV using a UNet model without MRI contrast agents was clearly  established. If developed further, this could improve patient treatment outcomes  and could obviate the need for contrast agents altogether.

When conventional  therapies fail, modulation of the affective pain matrix using reversible deep  brain stimulation (DBS) or targeted irreversible thalamotomy by stereotactic  radiosurgery (SRS) and magnetic resonance (MR)-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS)  appear to be considerable treatment options. We performed a literature search for  clinical trials targeting the affective pain circuits (thalamus, anterior  cingulate cortex [ACC], ventral striatum [VS]/internal capsule [IC]). PubMed,  Ovid, MEDLINE and Scopus were searched (1990-2021) using the terms ""chronic  pain"", ""deep brain stimulation"", ""stereotactic radiosurgery"",  ""radioneuromodulation"", ""MR-guided focused ultrasound"", ""affective pain  modulation"", ""pain attention"". In patients with CP treated with DBS, SRS or  MRgFUS the somatosensory thalamus and periventricular/periaquaeductal grey was  the target of choice in most treated subjects, while affective pain transmission  was targeted in a considerably lower number (DBS, SRS) consisting of the  following nodi of the limbic pain matrix: the anterior cingulate cortex;  centromedian-parafascicularis of the thalamus, pars posterior of the central  lateral nucleus and internal capsule/ventral striatum. Although DBS, SRS and  MRgFUS promoted a meaningful and sustained pain relief, an effective,  evidence-based comparative analysis is biased by heterogeneity of the observation  period varying between 3 months and 5 years with different stimulation patterns  (monopolar/bipolar contact configuration; frequency 10-130 Hz; intensity 0.8-5 V;  amplitude 90-330 μs), source and occurrence of lesioning (radiation versus  ultrasound) and chronic pain ethology (poststroke pain, plexus injury, facial  pain, phantom limb pain, back pain). The advancement of neurotherapeutics  (MRgFUS) and novel DBS targets (ACC, IC/VS), along with established and effective  stereotactic therapies (DBS-SRS), increases therapeutic options to impact CP by  modulating affective, pain-attentional neural transmission. Differences in trial  concept, outcome measures, targets and applied technique promote conflicting  findings and limited evidence. Hence, we advocate to raise awareness of the  potential therapeutic usefulness of each approach covering their advantages and  disadvantages, including such parameters as invasiveness, risk-benefit ratio,  reversibility and responsiveness.","2022-06","2024-03-06 17:03:27","2024-03-06T17:03:27Z","","459-476","","2","11","","Pain Ther","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Unique features of the brain,  including distinct cellular composition, immunological privilege, and physical  barriers to therapeutic delivery, likely contribute to the poor prognosis of  patients with neuro-oncological disease. Focused ultrasound is an emerging  technology that allows transcranial delivery of ultrasound energy to focal brain  targets with great precision. METHODS: A review of the clinical and preclinical  focused ultrasound literature was performed to obtain data regarding the current  state of the focused ultrasound in context of neuro-oncology. A narrative review  was then constructed to provide an overview of current and future applications of  this technology. RESULTS: Focused ultrasound can facilitate direct control of  tumors by thermal or mechanical ablation, as well as enhance delivery of diverse  therapeutics by disruption of the blood-brain barrier without local tissue  damage. Indeed, ultrasound-sensitive drug formulations or sonosensitizers may be  combined with ultrasound blood-brain barrier disruption to achieve high local  drug concentration while limiting systemic exposure to therapeutics. Furthermore,  focused ultrasound can induce radiosensitization, immunomodulation, and  neuromodulation. Here we review applications of focused ultrasound with a focus  on approaches currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of  neuro-oncological disease, such as blood-brain barrier disruption for drug  delivery and thermal ablation. We also discuss design of clinical trials,  selection of patient cohorts, and emerging approaches to improve the efficacy of  transcranial ultrasound, such as histotripsy, as well as combinatorial strategies  to exploit synergistic biological effects of existing cancer therapies and  ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: Focused ultrasound is a promising and actively expanding  therapeutic modality for diverse neuro-oncological diseases.","2022-01","2024-03-06 17:03:22","2024-03-06T17:03:22Z","","49-59","","1","156","","J Neurooncol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

This review provides a comprehensive introduction to the  underlying mechanics of both acoustic energy and neuronal membranes, defining the  primary variables for a subsequent review of the field's proposed mechanisms  supporting LIFU's neuromodulatory effects. An exhaustive review of the empirical  literature was also conducted and studies were grouped based on the sonication  parameters used and behavioral effects observed, with the goal of linking  empirical findings to the proposed theoretical mechanisms and evaluating which  model best fits the existing data. A neuronal intramembrane cavitation excitation  model, which accounts for differential effects as a function of cell-type,  emerged as a possible explanation for the range of excitatory effects found in  the literature. The suppressive and other findings need additional theoretical  mechanisms and these theoretical mechanisms need to have established  relationships to sonication parameters.","2022","2024-03-06 17:03:21","2024-03-06T17:03:21Z","","872639","","","16","","Front Hum Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Dell'Italia, Sanguinetti, Monti, Bystritsky and Reggente.","","","","","","PMID: 35547195  PMCID: PMC9081930","","","","focused ultrasound stimulation; low intensity focused ultrasound; neuromodulation; non-invasive brain stimulation; transcranial focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the impact of MRgFUS thalamotomy on spontaneous neuronal  activity in PD remains unclear. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate  the effects of MRgFUS thalamotomy on local fluctuations in neuronal activity as  measured by the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in  patients with PD. METHODS: Participants with PD undergoing MRgFUS thalamotomy  were recruited. Tremor scores were assessed before and 3 and 12 months after  treatment using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor. MRI data were collected  before and 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 12 months after thalamotomy. The  fALFF was calculated. A whole-brain voxel-wise paired t-test was used to identify  significant changes in fALFF at 12 months after treatment compared to baseline.  Then fALFF in the regions with significant differences were extracted from fALFF  maps of patients for further one-way repeated-measures ANOVA to investigate its  dynamic alterations. The association between fALFF changes induced by thalamotomy  and tremor improvement were evaluated using the nonparametric Spearman rank test.  RESULTS: Nine participants with PD (mean age ± SD 64.7 ± 6.1 years, 8 males) were  evaluated. Voxel-based analysis showed that fALFF in the left occipital cortex  (Brodmann area 17 [BA17]) significantly decreased at 12 months after thalamotomy  compared to baseline (voxel p < 0.001, cluster p < 0.05 family-wise error [FWE]  corrected). At baseline, fALFF in the left occipital BA17 in patients was  elevated compared with that in 9 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects (p <  0.05). Longitudinal analysis displayed the dynamic changes of fALFF in this  region (F (5,40) = 3.61, p = 0.009). There was a significant positive correlation  between the falling trend in fALFF in the left occipital BA17 and hand tremor  improvement after treatment over 3 time points (Spearman's rho = 0.44, p = 0.02).  CONCLUSIONS: The present study investigated the impact of MRgFUS ventral  intermediate nucleus thalamotomy on spontaneous neural activity in  medication-refractory tremor-dominant PD. The visual area is, for the first time,  reported as relevant to tremor improvement in PD after MRgFUS thalamotomy,  suggesting a distant effect of MRgFUS thalamotomy and the involvement of specific  visuomotor networks in tremor control in PD.","2022-03-01","2024-03-06 17:03:17","2024-03-06T17:03:17Z","","681-688","","3","136","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34479209","","","","*Essential Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Parkinson Disease/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Humans; MRgFUS; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Parkinson’s disease; Thalamus/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Treatment Outcome; Tremor/diagnostic imaging/etiology/surgery; fALFF; functional neurosurgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, data  on its application and results are limited to small studies in varying countries  and hospitals. This United Kingdom (UK) national service evaluation study  assessed how combined LUS and FUSIC Heart were used in COVID-19 Intensive Care  Unit (ICU) patients during the first wave of the pandemic. METHOD: Twelve trusts  across the UK registered for this prospective study. LUS and FUSIC Heart data  were obtained, using a standardised data set including scoring of abnormalities,  between 1(st) February 2020 to 30th July 2020. The scans were performed by  intensivists with FUSIC Lung and Heart competency as a minimum standard. Data was  anonymised locally prior to transfer to a central database. RESULTS: 372 studies  were performed on 265 patients. There was a small but significant relationship  between LUS score >8 and 30-day mortality (OR 1.8). Progression of score was  associated with an increase in 30-day mortality (OR 1.2). 30-day mortality was  increased in patients with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (49.4% vs 29.2%).  Severity of LUS score correlated with RV dysfunction (p < 0.05). Change in  management occurred in 65% of patients following a combined scan. CONCLUSIONS: In  COVID-19 patients, there is an association between lung ultrasound score  severity, RV dysfunction and mortality identifiable by combined LUS and FUSIC  Heart. The use of 12-point LUS scanning resulted in similar risk score to 6-point  imaging in the majority of cases.

In addition to sensing and regulating blood flow, they maintain blood-brain barrier function,  including precise control of nutrient exchange and efflux of xenobiotics. Many  signaling pathways in brain endothelial cells have been implicated in both health  and disease; however, our understanding of how these signaling pathways  functionally integrate is limited. A model capable of integrating these signaling  pathways could both advance our understanding of brain endothelial cell signaling  networks and potentially identify promising molecular targets for endothelial  cell-based drug or gene therapies. To this end, we developed a large-scale  computational model, wherein brain endothelial cell signaling pathways were  reconstructed from the literature and converted into a network of logic-based  differential equations. The model integrates 63 nodes (including proteins, mRNA,  small molecules, and cell phenotypes) and 82 reactions connecting these nodes.  Specifically, our model combines signaling pathways relating to VEGF-A, BDNF,  NGF, and Wnt signaling, in addition to incorporating pathways relating to focused  ultrasound as a therapeutic delivery tool. To validate the model, independently  established relationships between selected inputs and outputs were simulated,  with the model yielding correct predictions 73% of the time. We identified  influential and sensitive nodes under different physiological or pathological  contexts, including altered brain endothelial cell conditions during glioma,  Alzheimer's disease, and ischemic stroke. Nodes with the greatest influence over  combinations of desired model outputs were identified as potential druggable  targets for these disease conditions. For example, the model predicts therapeutic  benefits from inhibiting AKT, Hif-1α, or cathepsin D in the context of glioma -  each of which are currently being studied in clinical or pre-clinical trials.  Notably, the model also permits testing multiple combinations of node alterations  for their effects on the network and the desired outputs (such as inhibiting AKT  and overexpressing the P75 neurotrophin receptor simultaneously in the context of  glioma), allowing for the prediction of optimal combination therapies. In all,  our approach integrates results from over 100 past studies into a coherent and  powerful model, capable of both revealing network interactions unapparent from  studying any one pathway in isolation and predicting therapeutic targets for  treating devastating brain pathologies.","2022-03","2024-03-06 17:03:11","2024-03-06T17:03:11Z","","17-28","","","164","","J Mol Cell Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021.

Although tFUS involves delivering long  trains of acoustic pulses, the newly introduced TPS delivers ultrashort (∼3 μs)  pulses repeated at 4 Hz. Accordingly, only a single simulation study with limited  geometry currently exists for TPS. We considered a high-resolution  three-dimensional (3D) whole human head model in addition to water bath  simulations. We anticipate that the results of this study will help researchers  investigating LIFU have a better understanding of the effects of the two  different techniques. APPROACH: With an objective to first reproduce previous  computational results, we considered two spherical tFUS transducers that were  previously modeled. We assumed identical parameters (geometry, position, and  imaging data set) to demonstrate differences, purely because of the waveform  considered. For simulations with a 3D head data set, we also considered a  parabolic transducer that has been used for TPS delivery. RESULTS: Our initial  results successfully verified previous modeling workflow. The tFUS distribution  was characterized by the typical elliptical profile, with its major axis  perpendicular to the face of the transducer. The TPS distribution resembled two  mirrored meniscus profiles, with its widest diameter oriented parallel to the  face of the transducer. The observed intensity value differences were theoretical  because the two waveforms differ in both intensity and time. The consideration of  a realistic 3D human head model resulted in only a minor distortion of the two  waveforms. SIGNIFICANCE: This study simulated TPS administration using a 3D  realistic image-derived data set. Although our comparison results are strictly  limited to the model parameters and assumptions made, we were able to elucidate  some clear differences between the two approaches. We hope this initial study  will pave the way for systematic comparison between the two approaches in the  future.","2022-06","2024-03-06 17:03:09","2024-03-06T17:03:09Z","","606-613","","4","25","","Neuromodulation","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 International Neuromodulation Society.

Focused ultrasound combined with  microbubble-mediated BBB opening (FUS-BBBO) is a promising technique for  overcoming the frequently intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) in DIPG to enhance  therapeutic drug delivery to the brainstem. Since DIPG is highly diffusive,  large-volume FUS-BBBO is needed to cover the entire tumor region. The objective  of this study was to determine the optimal treatment strategy to achieve  efficient and homogeneous large-volume BBBO at the brainstem for the delivery of  an immune checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD-L1 antibody (aPD-L1). METHODS: Two  critical parameters for large-volume FUS-BBBO, multi-point sonication pattern  (interleaved vs. serial) and microbubble injection method (bolus vs. infusion),  were evaluated by treating mice with four combinations of these two parameters.  2D Passive cavitation imaging (PCI) was performed for monitoring the large-volume  sonication. RESULTS: Interleaved sonication combined with bolus injection of  microbubbles resulted in 1.29 to 2.06 folds higher efficiency than other  strategies as evaluated by Evans blue extravasation. The average coefficient of  variation of the Evans blue delivery was 0.66 for interleaved sonication with  bolus injection, compared to 0.680.88 for all other strategies. Similar trend was  also observed in the quantified total cavitation dose and coefficient of variance  of the cavitation dose. This strategy was then applied to deliver fluorescently  labeled aPD-L1 quantified using fluorescence imaging. A strong segmented linear  correlation (R2=0.81) was found between the total cavitation dose and the total  fluorescence intensity of aPD-L1 delivered at different sonication pressures  (0.15 MPa, 0.30 MPa, and 0.45 MPa). SIGNIFICANCE: Findings from this study  suggest that efficient and homogeneous large-volume FUS-BBBO can be achieved by  interleaved sonication combined with bolus injection of microbubbles, and the  efficiency and homogeneity can be monitored by PCI.","2022-04-27","2024-03-06 17:03:03","2024-03-06T17:03:03Z","","","","","PP","","IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35476579","","","","*Microbubbles; *Sonication/methods; Animals; Blood-Brain Barrier; Drug Delivery Systems/methods; Evans Blue; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Mice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While prior studies have compared focused ultrasound  simulations to clinical results, studies involving uterine fibroids remain  scarce. In our study, we perform such a comparison to assess the suitability of  simulations for treatment planning. METHODS: Sonications (N = 67) were simulated  retrospectively using acoustic and thermal models based on the Rayleigh integral  and Pennes bioheat equation followed by MR-thermometry simulation in seven  patients who underwent MRgFUS treatment for uterine fibroids. The spatial  accuracy of simulated focus location was assessed by evaluating displacements of  the centers of mass of the thermal dose distributions between simulated and  treatment MR thermometry slices. Temperature-time curves and sizes of 240  equivalent minutes at 43°C (240EM(43) ) volumes between treatment and simulation  were compared. RESULTS: The simulated focus location showed errors of 2.7 ± 4.1,  -0.7 ± 2.0, and 1.3 ± 1.2 mm (mean ± SD) in the anterior-posterior, foot-head,  and right-left directions for a fibroid absorption coefficient of 4.9 Np m(-1)  MHz(-1) and perfusion parameter of 1.89 kg m(-3) s(-1) . Linear regression of  240EM(43) volumes of 67 sonications of patient treatments and simulations  utilizing these parameters yielded a slope of 1.04 and a correlation coefficient  of 0.54. The temperature rise ratio of simulation to treatment near the end of  sonication was 0.47 ± 0.22, 1.28 ± 0.60, and 1.49 ± 0.71 for 66 sonications  simulated utilizing fibroid absorption coefficient of 1.2, 4.9, and 8.6 Np m(-1)  MHz(-1) , respectively, and the aforementioned perfusion value. The impact of  perfusion on peak temperature rise is minimal between 1.89 and 10 kg m(-3) s(-1)  , but became more substantial when utilizing a value of 100 kg m(-3) s(-1) .  CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that perfusion, while in some  cases having a substantial impact on thermal dose volumes, has less impact than  ultrasound absorption for predicting peak temperature elevation at least when  using perfusion parameter values up to 10 kg m(-3) s(-1) for this particular  array geometry, frequencies, and tissue target which is good for clinicians to be  aware of. The results suggest that simulations show promise in treatment  planning, particularly in terms of spatial accuracy. However, in order to use  simulations to predict temperature rise due to a sonication, knowledge of the  patient-specific tissue parameters, in particular the absorption coefficient is  important. Currently, spatially varying patient-specific tissue parameter values  are not available during treatment, so simulations can only be used for planning  purposes to estimate sonication performance on average.","2022-04","2024-03-06 17:03:02","2024-03-06T17:03:02Z","","2101-2119","","4","49","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.

FUS therapies require pre-therapy  planning and real-time monitoring during treatment to ensure the FUS beam is  correctly targeted to the desired tissue region. To facilitate more streamlined  FUS treatments, we present a system for pre-therapy planning, real-time FUS beam  visualization, and low intensity FUS treatment using a single diagnostic imaging  array. Therapy planning was accomplished by manually segmenting a B-mode image  captured by the imaging array and calculating a sonication pattern for the  treatment based on the user-input region of interest. For real-time monitoring,  the imaging array transmitted a visualization pulse which was focused to the same  location as the FUS therapy beam and ultrasonic backscatter from this pulse was  used to reconstruct the intensity field of the FUS beam. The therapy planning and  beam monitoring techniques were demonstrated in a tissue-mimicking phantom and in  a rat tumor in vivo while a mock FUS treatment was carried out. The FUS pulse  from the imaging array was excited with an MI of 0.78, which suggests that the  array could be used to administer select low intensity FUS treatments involving  microbubble activation.","2022-06","2024-03-06 17:03:00","2024-03-06T17:03:00Z","","1410-1419","","6","41","","IEEE Trans Med Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34986094","","","","*Microbubbles; *Ultrasonic Therapy/methods; Animals; Phantoms, Imaging; Rats; Ultrasonography/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focused ultrasound  (FUS) is a new brain stimulation modality that can exert a therapeutic effect on  diseased brain cells, with this effect ranging from permanent ablation of the  pathological neural circuit to transient excitatory/inhibitory modulation of the  neural activity depending on the acoustic energy of choice. With the development  of intraoperative imaging technology, FUS has become a clinically available  noninvasive neurosurgical option with visual feedback. Over the past 10 years,  FUS has shown enormous potential. It can deliver acoustic energy through the  physical barrier of the brain and eliminate abnormal brain cells to treat  patients with Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. In addition, FUS can help  introduce potentially beneficial therapeutics at the exact brain region where  they need to be, bypassing the brain's function barrier, which can be applied for  a wide range of central nervous system disorders. In this review, we introduce  the current FDA-approved clinical applications of FUS, ranging from thermal  ablation to blood barrier opening, as well as the emerging applications of FUS in  the context of pain control, epilepsy, and neuromodulation. We also discuss the  expansion of future applications and challenges. Broadening FUS technologies  requires a deep understanding of the effect of ultrasound when targeting various  brain structures in diverse disease conditions in the context of skull interface,  anatomical structure inside the brain, and pathology.","2022","2024-03-06 17:02:55","2024-03-06T17:02:55Z","","880814","","","13","","Front Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Baek, Lockwood, Mason, Obusez, Poturalski, Rammo, Nagel and Jones.","","","","","","PMID: 35614924  PMCID: PMC9124976","","","","MRgFUS; blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening; clinical focused ultrasound; high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU); low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU); neuromodulation; thermoablation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: From January 2015 to  December 2018, 122 patients in Chongqing Haifu Hospital who were diagnosed as  internal adenomyosis through history, clinical symptoms and enhanced magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) and treated with FUAS were enrolled in this study.  According to the patient's wishes, patients were given whether to ablate the  adenomyotic lesion alone or ablate the adenomyotic lesion and the endometrium  that involved in adenomyotic lesions together. The ablated area of adenomyotic  lesions and endomitrium were evaluated by post-FUAS enhanced MRI. The adverse  events and the changes of dysmenorrhea and menstrual volume at different  follow-up points within 24 months were recorded. Results: Among the 122 patients,  32 patients chose to ablate adenomyotic lesion alone, and 90 patients chose to  ablate the adenomyotic lesion and the endometrium during FUAS. No major  complications such as bowel injury and nerve injury occurred after FUAS. The  median non-perfused volume ratio of adenomyotic lesions was 31.7% in the group  without endometrial ablation and it was 60.0% in the group with endometrium  ablation (P<0.01). The improvement of dysmenorrhea in the group with endometrium  ablation was significantly better than the group without endometrial ablation  (P<0.01). The average menstrual volume score (3.4±0.9) before FUAS in the group  with endometrial ablation was higher than that in the group without endometrial  ablation (2.5±0.6; P<0.01), but it decreased significantly after FUAS treatment,  reaching the similar menstrual volume score of the group without endometrial  ablation (P>0.05). The proportions of abnormal vaginal discharge (34.4%, 31/90)  and bleeding (16.7%, 15/90) were significantly higher in the group with  endometrium ablation than those in the group without endometrial ablation (all  P<0.01).

The clinical results and the  influencing factors of bleeding and readmission for mass-type CSP were analyzed.  Results: All the patients underwent one time FUAS treatment successfully.  Immediately after FUAS treatment, color Doppler ultrasound showed obvious  necrosis and no perfusion area in all lesions, and the blood flow in the  mass-type CSP tissue significantly decreased. The median volume of blood loss in  the procedure was 20 ml (range: 5-950 ml). Thirteen patients (15%, 13/88) had  vaginal bleeding≥200 ml, and 15 patients (17%, 15/88) were hospitalized again.

METHODS: A retrospective  cohort was established in HSIL patients with HR-HPV infection treated with FUS or  LEEP from 2015 to 2019. The cohort consisted of 321 patients under 30 years of  age, of which 119 patients received FUS and 202 patients received LEEP.

An emerging technology to overcome this  limitation is focused ultrasound (FUS). When FUS interacts with intravenously  injected microbubbles (FUS(+MB)), the BBB opens, transiently allowing the access  of therapeutic agents into the brain. However, the ultrasound parameters need to  be tightly tuned: when the acoustic pressure is too low there is no opening, and  when it is too high, tissue damage can occur. We therefore asked whether barrier  permeability can be increased by combining FUS(+MB) with a second modality such  that in a clinical setting lower acoustic pressures could be used. Methods: Given  that FUS(+MB) achieves BBB opening in part by disruption of tight junction (TJ)  proteins such as claudin-5 of brain endothelial cells, we generated a stable MDCK  (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) II cell line (eGFP-hCldn5-MDCK II) that expresses  fluorescently tagged human claudin-5. Two claudin-5 binders, the peptide mC5C2  and cCPEm (truncated form of an enterotoxin), reported previously to weaken the  barrier, were synthesized and assessed for their abilities to enhance the  permeability of cellular monolayers. We then performed a comparative analysis of  single and combination treatments, measuring transendothelial electrical  resistance (TEER) and cargo leakage, combined with confocal image analysis.  Results: We successfully generated a novel cell line that formed functional  monolayers as validated by an increased TEER reading and a low (< 0.2%)  permeability to sodium fluorescein (376 Da). We found that the binders exerted a  time- and concentration-dependent effect on barrier opening when incubated over  an extended period, whereas FUS(+MB) caused a rapid opening followed by recovery  after 12 hours within the tested pressure range. Importantly, preincubation with  cCPEm prior to FUS(+MB) treatment resulted in greater barrier opening compared to  either FUS(+MB) or cCPEm alone as measured by reduced TEER values and an  increased permeability to fluorescently labelled 40 kDa dextran (FD40).  Conclusion: The data suggest that pre incubation with clinically suitable binders  to TJ proteins may be a general strategy to facilitate safer and more effective  ultrasound-mediated BBB opening in cellular and animal systems and potentially  also for the treatment of human diseases of the brain.","2022","2024-03-06 17:02:49","2024-03-06T17:02:49Z","","1952-1970","","5","12","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","eng","© The author(s).","","","","","","PMID: 35265192  PMCID: PMC8899584","","","","*Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism; *Blood-brain barrier (BBB); *Endothelial Cells/metabolism; *claudin-5; *focused ultrasound; *transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER); Animals; Blood-brain barrier (BBB); Brain/metabolism; Claudin-5/metabolism/pharmacology; Dogs; Drug Delivery Systems/methods; Microbubbles; claudin-5; focused ultrasound; transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tissue-mimicking materials (TMMs),  reflecting different soft tissue properties, are required for experimental  evaluation of therapeutic potential. In the study described here, poly(vinyl  alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels were characterized. Hydrogels prepared using different  concentrations (5%-20% w/w) and molecular weights of PVA ± cellulose scatterers  (2.5%-10% w/w) were characterized acoustically (sound speed, attenuation) as a  function of temperature (25°C-45°C), thermally (thermal conductivity, specific  heat capacity) and in terms of their cavitation thresholds. Results were compared  with measurements in fresh sheep tissue (kidney, liver, spleen). Sound speed  depended most strongly on PVA concentration, and attenuation, on cellulose  content. For the range of formulations investigated, the PVA gel acoustic  properties (sound speed: 1532 ± 17 to 1590 ± 9 m/s, attenuation coefficient: 0.08  ± 0.01 to 0.37 ± 0.02 dB/cm) fell within those measured in fresh tissue.  Cavitation thresholds for 10% PVA hydrogels (50% occurrence: 4.1-5.4 MPa, 75%  occurrence: 5.4-8.2 MPa) decreased with increasing cellulose content. In summary,  PVA cellulose composite hydrogels may be suitable mimics of acoustic, cavitation  and thermal properties of soft tissue for a number of therapeutic ultrasound  applications.","2022-06","2024-03-06 17:02:47","2024-03-06T17:02:47Z","","1095-1109","","6","48","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

MRI is used in guidance  of ultrasound treatment; however, the MR image quality in current clinical  applications is poor when using the vendor built-in body coil. We present an  8-channel, ultra-thin, flexible, and acoustically transparent receive-only head  coil design (FUS-Flex) to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and thus the  quality of MR images during MRgFUS procedures. Acoustic simulations/experiments  exhibit transparency of the FUS-Flex coil as high as 97% at 650 kHz.  Electromagnetic simulations show a SNR increase of 13× over the body coil. In  vivo results show an increase of the SNR over the body coil by a factor of 7.3  with 2× acceleration (equivalent to 11× without acceleration) in the brain of a  healthy volunteer, which agrees well with simulation. These preliminary results  show that the use of a FUS-Flex coil in MRgFUS surgery can increase MR image  quality, which could yield improved focal precision, real-time intraprocedural  anatomical imaging, and real-time 3D thermometry mapping.","2022","2024-03-06 17:02:46","2024-03-06T17:02:46Z","","25062-25072","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 35600672  PMCID: PMC9119199","","","","Magnetic resonance imaging; coils; ultrasonic transducer arrays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So far, however, little is known about the impact of  tcMRgFUS on structural connectivity. The objective of this study was to detect  microstructural changes in tremor- and motor-related white matter tracts in  essential tremor patients treated with tcMRgFUS thalamotomy. Methods Eleven  patients diagnosed with essential tremor were enrolled in this tcMRgFUS  thalamotomy study. For each patient, 3T MRI including structural and diffusion  MRI were acquired and the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor was assessed prior to  the procedure as well as one year after the treatment. Diffusion MRI tractography  was performed to identify the cerebello-thalamo-cortical tract (CTCT), the medial  lemniscus (ML) and the corticospinal tract (CST) in both hemispheres on  pre-treatment data. Pre-treatment tractography results were co-registered to  post-treatment diffusion data. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, including  fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD),  were averaged across the tracts in the pre- and post-treatment data. Results The  mean value of tract-specific DTI metrics changed significantly within the  thalamic lesion and in the CTCT on the treated side (p<0.05). Changes of  DTI-derived indices within the CTCT correlated well with lesion overlap (FA:  r=-0.54, p=0.04; MD: r=0.57, p=0.04); RD: r=0.67, p=0.036). Furthermore, a trend  was seen for the correlation between changes of DTI-derived indices within the  CTCT and clinical improvement (FA: r=0.58; p=0.062; MD: r=-0.52, p=0.64; RD:  r=-0.61 p=0.090). Conclusions Microstructural changes were detected within the  CTCT after tcMRgFUS and these changes correlated well with lesion-tract overlap.  Our results show that diffusion MRI is able to detect the microstructural effects  of tcMRgFUS, thereby further elucidating the treatment mechanism and ultimately  to improve targeting prospectively.","2022-06-09","2024-03-06 17:02:41","2024-03-06T17:02:41Z","","","","","","","Brain Connect","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35678063","","","","*Essential Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Altered brain connectivity; Brain; Diffusion Tensor Imaging/methods; Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); Fiber tracking; Humans; MR-guided focused ultrasound; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Movement disorders; Tremor; Tremors; diffusion tensor imaging; essential tremor; microstructural change; structural connectivity; tractography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The remarkable clinical  effect seen with CAR T cell therapies against hematological malignancies have  attracted interest in developing such therapies for solid tumors, including brain  tumors. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and  is associated with poor prognosis due to its highly aggressive nature. Pediatric  brain cancers are similarly aggressive and thus are a major cause of pediatric  cancer-related death. CAR T cell therapy represents a promising avenue for  therapy against these malignancies. Several specific TAs, such as EGFR/EGFRvIII,  IL13Rα2, B7-H3, and HER2, have been targeted in preclinical studies and clinical  trials. Unfortunately, CAR T cells against brain tumors have showed limited  efficacy due to TA heterogeneity, difficulty trafficking from blood to tumor  sites, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, we review current  CAR T cell approaches in treating cancers, with particular focus on brain  cancers. We also describe a novel technique of focused ultrasound controlling the  activation of engineered CAR T cells to achieve the safer cell therapies.  Finally, we summarize the development of combinational strategies to improve the  efficacy and overcome historical limitations of CAR T cell therapy.","2022","2024-03-06 17:02:37","2024-03-06T17:02:37Z","","817296","","","13","","Front Immunol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Lin, Mashouf and Lim.","","","","","","PMID: 35265074  PMCID: PMC8899093","","","","*Brain Neoplasms; *CAR T cell; *Glioblastoma; *Receptors, Chimeric Antigen; *brain tumor; *focus ultrasound; *glioma; *immunotherapy; Antigens, Neoplasm; CAR T cell; Child; Humans; Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods; T-Lymphocytes; Tumor Microenvironment; brain tumor; focus ultrasound; glioma; immunotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To  report oncological outcomes and adverse events following focal high-intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU) for treating nonmetastatic prostate cancer. DESIGN,  SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An analysis of 1379 patients with ≥6 mo of follow-up  prospectively recorded in the HIFU Evaluation and Assessment of Treatment (HEAT)  registry from 13 UK centres (2005-2020) was conducted. Five or more years of  follow-up was available for 325 (24%) patients. Focal HIFU therapy used a  transrectal ultrasound-guided device (Sonablate; Sonacare Inc., Charlotte, NC,  USA). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Failure-free survival (FFS)  was primarily defined as avoidance of no evidence of disease to require salvage  whole-gland or systemic treatment, or metastases or prostate cancer-specific  mortality. Differences in FFS between D'Amico risk groups were determined using a  log-rank analysis. Adverse events were reported using Clavien-Dindo  classification. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The median (interquartile range) age was  66 (60-71) yr and prostate-specific antigen was 6.9 (4.9-9.4) ng/ml with D'Amico  intermediate risk in 65% (896/1379) and high risk in 28% (386/1379). The overall  median follow-up was 32 (17-58) mo; for those with ≥5 yr of follow-up, it was 82  (72-94). A total of 252 patients had repeat focal treatment due to residual or  recurrent cancer; overall 92 patients required salvage whole-gland treatment.  Kaplan-Meier 7-yr FFS was 69% (64-74%). Seven-year FFS in intermediate- and  high-risk cancers was 68% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62-75%) and 65% (95% CI  56-74%; p = 0.3). Clavien-Dindo >2 adverse events occurred in 0.5% (7/1379). The  median 10-yr follow-up is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: Focal HIFU in carefully selected  patients with clinically significant prostate cancer, with six and three of ten  patients having, respectively, intermediate- and high-risk cancer, has good  cancer control in the medium term. PATIENT SUMMARY: Focal high-intensity focused  ultrasound treatment to areas of prostate with cancer can provide an alternative  to treating the whole prostate. This treatment modality has good medium-term  cancer control over 7 yr, although 10-yr data are not yet available.","2022-04","2024-03-06 17:02:36","2024-03-06T17:02:36Z","","407-413","","4","81","","Eur Urol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 European Association of Urology.

Traditionally, invasive  strategies such as open or stereotactic biopsies have been used to confirm the  etiology of clinical and imaging changes. Liquid biopsies can enable physicians  to noninvasively analyze the evolution of a tumor and a patient's response to  specific treatments. However, as a consequence of biology and the current  limitations in detection methods, no blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) brain  tumor-derived biomarkers are used in routine clinical practice. Enhancing the  presence of tumor biomarkers in blood and CSF via brain-blood barrier (BBB)  disruption with MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a very compelling  strategy for future management of brain tumor patients. METHODS: A literature  review on MRgFUS-enabled brain tumor liquid biopsy was performed using  Medline/Pubmed databases and clinical trial registries. RESULTS: The therapeutic  applications of MRgFUS to target brain tumors have been under intense  investigation. At high-intensity, MRgFUS can ablate brain tumors and target  tissues, which needs to be balanced with the increased risk for damage to  surrounding normal structures. At lower-intensity and pulsed-frequency, MRgFUS  may be able to disrupt the BBB transiently. Thus, while facilitating intratumoral  or parenchymal access to standard or novel therapeutics, BBB disruption with  MRgFUS has opened the possibility of enhanced detection of brain tumor-derived  biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we describe the concept of  MRgFUS-enabled brain tumor liquid biopsy and present the available preclinical  evidence, ongoing clinical trials, limitations, and future directions of this  application.","2022-01","2024-03-06 17:02:31","2024-03-06T17:02:31Z","","33-48","","1","156","","J Neurooncol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

A potential solution to late and distant  recurrence is to augment systemic antitumor immunity, in part by appropriately  presenting tumor antigens, but also by modulating the immunosuppressive tumor  microenvironment (TME). We previously validated this concept in models of murine  carcinoma treated with a novel predominately microcavitating version of  high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), mechanical high-intensity focused  ultrasound (M-HIFU). Here we elucidated the mechanisms of enhanced antitumor  immunity by M-HIFU over conventional thermal high-intensity focused ultrasound  (T-HIFU) and investigated the potential of the combinatorial strategy with an  immune checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD-L1 antibody. METHODS: The antitumor efficacy  of treatments was investigated in syngeneic murine breast cancer models using  triple-negative (E0771) or human ErbB-2 (HER2) expressing (MM3MG-HER2) tumors in  C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice, respectively. Induction of systemic antitumor immunity by  the treatments was tested using bilateral tumor implantation models. Flow  cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed to  elucidate detailed effects of HIFU treatments or combination treatment on TME,  including the activation status of CD8 T cells and polarization of  tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). RESULTS: More potent systemic antitumor  immunity and tumor growth suppression were induced by M-HIFU compared with  T-HIFU. Molecular characterization of the TME after M-HIFU by single-cell RNA  sequencing demonstrated repolarization of TAM to the immunostimulatory M1 subtype  compared with TME post-T-HIFU. Concurrent anti-PD-L1 antibody administration or  depletion of CD4(+) T cells containing a population of regulatory T cells  markedly increased T cell-mediated antitumor immunity and tumor growth  suppression at distant, untreated tumor sites in M-HIFU treated mice compared  with M-HIFU monotherapy. CD8 T and natural killer cells played major roles as  effector cells in the combination treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Physical disruption of  the TME by M-HIFU repolarizes TAM, enhances T-cell infiltration, and, when  combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody, mediates superior systemic antitumor immune  responses and distant tumor growth suppression. These findings suggest M-HIFU  combined with anti-PD-L1 may be useful in reducing late recurrence or metastasis  when applied to primary tumors.","2022-01","2024-03-06 17:00:36","2024-03-06T17:00:36Z","","","","1","10","","J Immunother Cancer","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Methods: A total of nine consecutive patients confirmed with TDPD who underwent  unilateral Vim ablation by MRgFUS between April 2019 and September 2019 were  included. The Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale  part III (MDS-UPDRSIII) and Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) were  performed in the ON and OFF stages to distinguish the surgical effects from drug  therapy effects. The adverse events and adjustment of drug doses were also  recorded. Results: The preoperative MDS-UPDRSIII score in OFF and ON states was  55.0 (48.0, 65.5) and 26.0 (17.0, 27.0), while the CRST score was 46.0 (39.5,  53.5) and 20.0 (13.0, 23.5), respectively; the Levodopa equivalent dose was 600  (456, 600) mg/d.

Up to a third of patients may require further local  salvage treatment after ablative therapy failure. Limited descriptive, but no  comparative, evidence exists between different salvage treatment outcomes. The  aim of this study was to compare oncological and functional outcomes after  salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (SRARP) and salvage radiotherapy  (SRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected prospectively and  retrospectively on 100 consecutive SRARP cases and 100 consecutive SRT cases  after ablative therapy failure in a high-volume tertiary centre. RESULTS:  High-risk patients were over-represented in the SRARP group (66.0%) compared with  the SRT group (48.0%) (P = 0.013). The median (interquartile range) follow-up  after SRARP was 16.5 (10.0-30.0) months and 37.0 (18.5-64.0) months after SRT.  SRT appeared to confer greater biochemical recurrence-free survival at 1, 2 and 3  years compared with SRARP in high-risk patients (year 3: 86.3% versus 66.0%), but  biochemical recurrence-free survival was similar for intermediate-risk patients  (year 3: 90.0% versus 75.6%). There was no statistical difference in pad-free  continence at 12 and 24 months between SRARP (77.2 and 84.7%) and SRT (75.0 and  74.0%) (P = 0.724, 0.114). Erectile function was more likely to be preserved in  men who underwent SRT. After SRT, cumulative bowel and urinary Radiation Therapy  Oncology Group toxicity grade I were 25.0 and 45.0%, grade II were 11.0 and 11.0%  and grade III or IV complications were 4.0 and 5.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: We  report the first comparative analyses of salvage prostatectomy and radiotherapy  following ablative therapy. Men with high-risk disease appear to have superior  oncological outcomes after SRT; however, treatment allocation does not appear to  influence oncological outcomes for men with intermediate-risk disease. Treatment  allocation was associated with a different spectrum of toxicity profile. Our data  may inform shared decision-making when considering salvage treatment following  focal or whole-gland ablative therapy.","2022-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","e69-e78","","1","34","","Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 The Royal College of Radiologists.

However, it lacks specificity, and its inter-reader reproducibility  remains moderate. Biomarkers, such as the Prostate Health Index (PHI), may help  select patients for prostate biopsy. Computer-aided diagnosis/detection (CAD)  systems may also improve mpMRI interpretation. Different prototypes of CAD  systems are currently developed under the Recherche Hospitalo-Universitaire en  Santé / Personalized Focused Ultrasound Surgery of Localized Prostate Cancer (RHU  PERFUSE) research programme, tackling challenging issues such as robustness  across imaging protocols and magnetic resonance (MR) vendors, and ability to  characterise cancer aggressiveness. The study primary objective is to evaluate  the non-inferiority of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  of the final CAD system as compared with the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data  System V.2.1 (PI-RADS V.2.1) in predicting the presence of ISUP ≥2 prostate  cancer in patients undergoing prostate biopsy. METHODS: This prospective,  multicentre, non-inferiority trial will include 420 men with suspected prostate  cancer, a prostate-specific antigen level of ≤30 ng/mL and a clinical stage  ≤T2 c. Included men will undergo prostate mpMRI that will be interpreted using  the PI-RADS V.2.1 score. Then, they will undergo systematic and targeted biopsy.  PHI will be assessed before biopsy. At the end of patient inclusion, MR images  will be assessed by the final version of the CAD system developed under the RHU  PERFUSE programme. Key secondary outcomes include the prediction of ISUP grade ≥2  prostate cancer during a 3-year follow-up, and the number of biopsy procedures  saved and ISUP grade ≥2 cancers missed by several diagnostic pathways combining  PHI and MRI findings.

However, due to heterogeneity in techniques and targets, the cognitive outcome  and brain network connectivity remain unknown. We performed a systematic review,  meta-analysis, and normative functional connectivity to determine the cognitive  outcome and brain networks of DBS and non-invasive neuromodulation in AD. PubMed,  Embase, and Web of Science were searched using three concepts: dementia, brain  connectome, and brain stimulation, with filters for English, human studies, and  publication dates 1980-2021. Additional records from clinicaltrials.gov were  added. Inclusion criteria were AD study with DBS or non-invasive neuromodulation  and a cognitive outcome. Exclusion criteria were less than 3-months follow-up,  severe dementia, and focused ultrasound intervention. Bias was assessed using  Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence. We performed  meta-analysis, with subgroup analysis based on type and age at neuromodulation.  To determine the patterns of neuromodulation-induced brain network activation, we  performed normative functional connectivity using rsfMRI of 1000 healthy  subjects. Six studies, with 242 AD patients, met inclusion criteria. On  fixed-effect meta-analysis, non-invasive neuromodulation favored baseline, with  effect size -0.40(95% [CI], -0.73, -0.06, p = 0.02), while that of DBS was  0.11(95% [CI] -0.34, 0.56, p = 0.63), in favor of DBS. In patients ≥65 years old,  DBS improved cognitive outcome, 0.95(95% [CI] 0.31, 1.58, p = 0.004), whereas in  patients <65 years old baseline was favored, -0.17(95% [CI] -0.93, 0.58,  p = 0.65). Functional connectivity regions were in the default mode (DMN),  salience (SN), central executive (CEN) networks, and Papez circuit. The subgenual  cingulate and anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC) showed connectivity to all  targets of neuromodulation. This meta-analysis provides level II evidence of a  difference in response of AD patients to DBS, based on age at intervention. Brain  stimulation in AD may modulate DMN, SN, CEN, and Papez circuit, with the  subgenual cingulate and ALIC as potential targets.","2022-11-21","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","490","","1","12","","Transl Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Desmoid tumors can impact functionality and cause  treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Here, the authors review current  management strategies and avenues for further investigation. As part of the  evolution of therapy away from primary surgical approaches to less invasive  options, image-guided ablation has been accepted as less morbid and include  cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound. Systemic therapy options  currently include hormonal agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tyrosine  kinase inhibitors, and anthracycline-based regimens. Hormonal agents and  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have benign side effect profiles but  generally limited efficacy. Anthracycline-based therapies are limited by the risk  of secondary malignancies and cardiomyopathy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are well  studied, and sorafenib is now one of the most utilized therapies, though limited  by its side effect profile. Nirogacestat (PF-0308401) is an investigational small  molecule gamma-secretase (GS) inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in phase 1  and II trials. A phase III trial investigating patients with desmoid tumors or  aggressive fibromatosis is estimated to be completed December 2021 (NCT03785964).  In addition to nirogacestat, the gamma-secretase inhibitor AL102 is being  investigated for the treatment of patients with progressing desmoid tumors in the  phase II/III RINGSIDE trial.

Its rationale is the disruption of ictal spread to prevent  seizure generalization. The objective pursued is alleviation of intractable,  debilitating, and injurious manifestations of generalized epilepsy.(1) Eight  decades of experience support this procedure's safety and effectiveness for  appropriately selected patients with drug-resistant epilepsy not amenable to  optimal resection; particularly, favorable outcomes for tonic or atonic seizures  with drop attacks have been reported.(2)(,)(3) Children may benefit more than  adults from callosotomy for improved daily function, psychosocial adjustment, and  family satisfaction.(4) A meta-analysis found a better seizure reduction from  total than partial callosotomy (88.2% vs. 58.6% of worthwhile reduction)  comprising drop-attacks (77.8% vs. 45.4%) with an increased but transient (i.e.,  resolution within 6 weeks) risk of significant disconnection syndromes (12.5% vs.  none).(5) Here, we present the illustrative case of a 4-year-old boy with  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who underwent open single-stage complete callosotomy.  Video 1 shows the microscope-assisted interhemispheric approach aided by  stereotactic navigation. We showcase critical steps such as dissection of  cingulate gyri and anterior and then posterior callosotomy while highlighting  crucial anatomic landmarks. This procedure may be accessible for epilepsy  surgeons worldwide in resource-constrained environments(6) while serving as a  basis for promising high-technology development (e.g., endoscopic, radiosurgical,  laser interstitial thermal therapy, or magnetic resonance-guided focused  ultrasound callosotomies).

The  current study aimed to provide insights on this topic through a series of  experiments performed in the framework of evaluating the MRI compatibility of an  MRgFUS robotic device. All experiments were performed in a 1.5 T MRI scanner. The  main metric for MRI compatibility assessment was the signal to noise ratio (SNR).  Measurements were carried out in a tissue mimicking phantom and freshly excised  pork tissue under various activation states of the system. In the effort to  minimize magnetic interference and image distortion, various set-up parameters  were examined. Significant SNR degradation and image distortion occurred when the  FUS transducer was activated mainly owing to FUS-induced target and coil  vibrations and was getting worse as the output power was increased. Proper design  and stable positioning of the imaged phantom play a critical role in reducing  these vibrations. Moreover, isolation of the phantom from the imaging coil was  proven essential for avoiding FUS-induced vibrations from being transferred to  the coil during sonication and resulted in a more than 3-fold increase in SNR.  The use of a multi-channel coil increased the SNR by up to 50 % compared to a  single-channel coil. Placement of the electronics outside the coil detection area  increased the SNR by about 65 %. A similar SNR improvement was observed when the  encoders' counting pulses were deactivated. Overall, this study raises awareness  about major challenges regarding operation of an MRgFUS system in the MRI  environment and proposes simple measures that could mitigate the impact of noise  sources so that the monitoring value of MR imaging in FUS applications is not  compromised.","2022-11","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","107317","","","344","","J Magn Reson","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, boosting PD  therapeutic efficacy by enhancing the autophagy of microglia to phagocytose and  degrade α-syn via controlled opening of their surface TRPV1 channels with  rationally designed photothermal nanoagent is reported. The Cu(2-) (x)  Se-anti-TRPV1 nanoparticles (CS-AT NPs) are fabricated to target the microglia  and open their surface TRPV1 channels under the second near infrared (NIR-II)  laser irradiation to cause influx of Ca(2+) to activate ATG5 and Ca(2+)  /CaMKK2/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, which promote phagocytosis and degradation  of α-syn. The CS-AT NPs are efficiently delivered by focused ultrasound into  striatum of PD mice with high expression of TRPV1 receptors. The athletic ability  of PD mice treated by CS-AT NPs and NIR-II irradiation is significantly improved  due to the phagocytotic clearance of α-syn by microglia with enhanced autophagy.  The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, ionized calcium binding adapter protein 1, glial  fibrillary acidic protein, and pSer129-α-syn (p-α-syn) of treated PD mice are  almost recovered to the normal levels of healthy mice.

PURPOSE: This document will presume the  indication for treatment is clear and approved by the MDT and will define the  standards required for the performance of each modality. CIRSE Standards of  Practice documents are not intended to impose a standard of clinical patient  care, but recommend a reasonable approach to, and best practices for, the  performance of thermal ablation of bone tumours. METHODS: The writing group was  established by the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee and consisted of five  clinicians with internationally recognised expertise in thermal ablation of bone  tumours. The writing group reviewed the existing literature on thermal ablation  of bone tumours, performing a pragmatic evidence search using PubMed to search  for publications in English and relating to human subjects from 2009 to 2019.  Selected studies published in 2020 and 2021 during the course of writing these  standards were subsequently included. The final recommendations were formulated  through consensus. RESULTS: Recommendations were produced for the performance of  thermal ablation of bone tumours taking into account the biologic behaviour of  the tumour and the therapeutic intent of the procedure. Recommendations are  provided based on lesion characteristics and thermal modality, for the use of  tissue monitoring and protection, and for the appropriately timed application of  adjunctive procedures such as osseus consolidation and transarterial  embolisation. RESULTS: Percutaneous thermal ablation has an established role in  the successful management of bone lesions, with both curative and palliative  intent.

Biological material and debris  accumulate in the inner walls of the valve and catheters block the normal flow of  the drained cerebrospinal fluid causing severe symptoms with high morbidity and  mortality. Unfortunately, at present, there is no effective preventive protocol  or cleaning procedure available. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether externally applied,  focused ultrasound beams can be used to resuspend deposits accumulated in brain  shunts safely. METHODS: A computational model of an implanted brain shunt was  implemented to test the initial design parameters of a system comprising several  ultrasound transducers. Under laboratory conditions, configurations with 3 and 4  transducers were arranged in a triangle and square pattern with their radiation  axis directed towards a target model of the device, 2 catheters and a brain shunt  filled with water and deposited graphite powder. The ultrasound beams were then  concentrated on the device across a head model. RESULTS: The computational model  revealed that by using only 3 transducers, the acoustic field intensity on the  valve was approximately twice that on the brain surface suggesting that acoustic  cavitation could be selectively achieved. Resuspension of graphite deposits  inside the catheters and the valve were then physically demonstrated and  video-recorded with no temperature increase. CONCLUSION: The technology presented  here has the potential to be used routinely as a noninvasive, preventive cleaning  procedure to reduce the likelihood of obstruction-related events in patients with  hydrocephalus treated with an implanted shunt.","2022-11-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","420-426","","5","23","","Oper Neurosurg (Hagerstown)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

To understand how it operates, it is essential to understand the link between neural  activity and behavior. Experimental investigation of that link requires tools to  interact with neural activity during behavior. Human neuroscience, however, has  been severely bottlenecked by the limitations of these tools. While invasive  methods can support highly specific interaction with brain activity during  behavior, their applicability in human neuroscience is limited. Despite extensive  development in the last decades, noninvasive alternatives have lacked spatial  specificity and yielded results that are commonly fraught with variability and  replicability issues, along with relatively limited understanding of the neural  mechanisms involved. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the  state-of-the-art in interacting with human brain activity and highlight current  limitations and recent efforts to overcome these limitations. Beyond crucial  technical and scientific advancements in electromagnetic brain stimulation, new  frontiers in interacting with human brain activity such as task-irrelevant  sensory stimulation and focal ultrasound stimulation are introduced.

Ultrasound energy focused on retinal  neurons can trigger the activities of retinal neurons with high spatial-temporal  resolution. This paper introduces a novel design and simulation of a ring array  transducer that could be used as non-invasive ultrasonic retinal stimulation. The  array transducer is designed in the shape of a racing ring with a hemisphere  surface that mimics a contact lens to acoustically couple with the eye via the  tear film and directs the ultrasound to avoid the high acoustic absorption from  the crystalline lens. We will describe the design methods and simulation of the  two-dimensional pattern stimulation.

Given the rapid growth in the  noninvasive fat and cellulite reduction market, it is essential that physicians  be aware of associated adverse events. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using  the MAUDE electronic database on the FDA website, the authors performed a  comprehensive search of reported complications of noninvasive fat reduction and  cellulite reduction devices from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2020 at  http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm. Medical  device reports that likely represented medical adverse events from device use  were included. RESULTS: The search yielded 165 MDRs, a majority submitted by  patients. There were 68 MDRs reported on cryolipolysis (41.2%), 34 MDRs reported  on 1,060-nm laser lipolysis (20.6%), 19 MDRs reported on high-intensity focused  ultrasound (11.5%), 17 MDRs reported on vacuum-assisted subcision (10.3%), 10  MDRs reported on 1,440-nm laser-assisted subcision (6.1%), 8 MDRs reported on  monopolar radiofrequency (4.8%), 6 MDRs reported on focused ultrasound (3.6%),  and 4 MDRs reported for a combination infrared light, bipolar radiofrequency  energy, massage, and gentle suction treatment (2.4%). CONCLUSION: It can be  safely presumed that most physicians do not regularly report adverse events to  the FDA; however, the MAUDE database remains the largest global repository of  adverse events reported for noninvasive body contouring devices, an area that has  grown tremendously over the last few years. Some MDRs may be unrelated and/or  unsubstantiated, and MDRs for any given device must be correlated to the total  number of procedures performed. Nevertheless, the MAUDE database allows a glimpse  into potential adverse events that can occur. The authors hope that physician  awareness of this database and the adverse events it reports will help improve  patient safety.","2022-07-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","758-763","","7","48","","Dermatol Surg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, Inc.

To develop an approach for individualized closed-loop feedback control of microbubble cavitation to achieve safe and  effective focused ultrasound in combination with microbubble-induced blood-brain  barrier opening (FUS-BBBO). Introduction. FUS-BBBO is a promising strategy for  noninvasive and localized brain drug delivery with a growing number of clinical  studies currently ongoing. Real-time cavitation monitoring and feedback control  are critical to achieving safe and effective FUS-BBBO. However, feedback control  algorithms used in the past were either open-loop or without consideration of  baseline cavitation level difference among subjects. Methods. This study  performed feedback-controlled FUS-BBBO by defining the target cavitation level  based on the baseline stable cavitation level of an individual subject with  ""dummy"" FUS sonication. The dummy FUS sonication applied FUS with a low acoustic  pressure for a short duration in the presence of microbubbles to define the  baseline stable cavitation level that took into consideration of individual  differences in the detected cavitation emissions. FUS-BBBO was then achieved  through two sonication phases: ramping-up phase to reach the target cavitation  level and maintaining phase to control the stable cavitation level at the target  cavitation level. Results. Evaluations performed in wild-type mice demonstrated  that this approach achieved effective and safe trans-BBB delivery of a model  drug. The drug delivery efficiency increased as the target cavitation level  increased from 0.5 dB to 2 dB without causing vascular damage. Increasing the  target cavitation level to 3 dB and 4 dB increased the probability of tissue  damage. Conclusions. Safe and effective brain drug delivery was achieved using  the individualized closed-loop feedback-controlled FUS-BBBO.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","9867230","","","2022","","BME Front","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Chih-Yen Chien et al.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37850162  PMCID: PMC10521637","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system uses computed tomography (CT) images to  calculate phase corrections that account for aberrations caused by the human  skull. This work investigates whether magnetic resonance (MR) images can be used  as an alternative to CT images to calculate phase corrections. Phase corrections  were calculated using the gold standard hydrophone method and the standard of  care InSightec ray tracing method. MR binary image mask, MR-simulated-CT  (MRsimCT), and CT images of three ex vivo human skulls were supplied as inputs to  the InSightec ray tracing method. The degassed ex vivo human skulls were  sonicated with a 670 kHz hemispherical phased array transducer (InSightec  Exablate 4000). 3D raster scans of the beam profiles were acquired using a  hydrophone mounted on a 3-axis positioner system. Focal spots were evaluated  using six metrics: pressure at the target, peak pressure, intensity at the  target, peak intensity, positioning error, and focal spot volume. Targets at the  geometric focus and 5 mm lateral to the geometric focus were investigated. There  was no statistical difference between any of the metrics at either target using  either MRsimCT or CT for phase aberration correction. As opposed to the MRsimCT,  the use of CT images for aberration correction requires registration to the  treatment day MR images; CT misregistration within a range of ± 2 degrees of  rotation error along three dimensions was shown to reduce focal spot intensity by  up to 9.4%. MRsimCT images used for phase aberration correction for the skull  produce similar results as CT-based correction, while avoiding both CT to MR  registration errors and unnecessary patient exposure to ionizing radiation.","2022-08-04","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","13407","","1","12","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Pharmacotherapy is often successful, but up to 50% of patients are resistant to  medications or cannot tolerate side effects. Thalamotomy to the ventral  intermediate nucleus of the thalamus is a surgical intervention for refractory  tremor. Thalamotomy surgeries include radiofrequency and incisionless procedures,  such as Gamma Knife radiosurgery and magnetic resonance-guided focused  ultrasound. Cognitive changes following thalamotomy have been inconsistently  reported across studies. We performed a meta-analysis to summarize the impact of  unilateral thalamotomy to the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus across  multiple cognitive domains. We searched MEDLINE, Embase Classic, Embase and EBM  Reviews for relevant studies. Neuropsychological tests were categorized into  seven cognitive domains: global cognition, verbal memory, non-verbal memory,  executive function, phonemic fluency, semantic fluency and visuospatial  processing. We calculated standardized mean differences as Hedges' g and 95%  confidence intervals of the change between pre- and postoperative cognitive  scores. Pooling of standardized mean differences across studies was performed  using random-effects models. Risk of bias across studies and quality of evidence  for each cognitive domain were assessed with the National Institute of Health  quality assessment tool and the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool,  respectively. Of the 1251 records reviewed, eight studies met inclusion criteria.  We included 193 patients with essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, or multiple  sclerosis in the meta-analysis. There was a small significant decline in phonemic  fluency [standardized mean difference = -0.29, 95% confidence interval: (-0.52,  -0.05), P = 0.017] and a trend towards a decline in semantic fluency  [standardized mean difference = -0.19, 95% confidence interval: (-0.40, 0.01), P  = 0.056]. No postoperative changes were observed in the other cognitive domains  (P values >0.14). In secondary analyses, we restricted the analyses to studies  using magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound given its growing popularity  and more precise targeting. In those analyses, there was no evidence of cognitive  decline across any domain (P values >0.37). In terms of risk of bias, five  studies were rated as 'good' and three studies were rated as 'fair'. According to  GRADEpro guidelines, the certainty of the effect for all cognitive domains was  low. This study provides evidence that unilateral thalamotomy to the ventral  intermediate nucleus of the thalamus is relatively safe from a cognitive  standpoint, however, there may be a small decline in verbal fluency. Magnetic  resonance-guided focused ultrasound might have a more favourable postoperative  cognitive profile compared with other thalamotomy techniques.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","fcac287","","6","4","","Brain Commun","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2022.

Several techniques such as radiofrequency, deep brain stimulation (DBS),  gamma knife (GK) radiosurgery and high-intensity focused ultrasound may be used  for the surgical treatment of ET. The aim of this paper is to summarize the most  recent available literature on DBS, transcranial magnetic resonance-guided  focused ultrasound (tcMRgFUS) and GK, and to compare indications, targets, and  effectiveness of these surgical techniques for the treatment of ET. EVIDENCE  ACQUISITION: A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting  Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The  literature search was performed on the three largest medical databases (PubMed,  Scopus, and Web of Science). This systematic review is focused on the  effectiveness and safety of GK, DBS, and tcMRgFUS as functional neurosurgical  techniques for the treatment of ET. The aim of this study was to compare these  techniques by evaluating mode, target, effectiveness in improving motor outcomes,  and rates of adverse effects. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Articles meeting the  predetermined criteria were included. Data for DBS, tcMRgFUS, and GK were  analyzed and compared for indications, patient selection, advantages vs.  disadvantages, and treatment targets for essential tremor. CONCLUSIONS: DBS,  tcMRgFUS and GK are effective techniques for the treatment of ET. Despite  different functioning principles, all three surgical techniques require a proper  functional diagnosis to define accurate indications for patient selection. Their  indication depends upon the patient's neurological condition and their  effectiveness relies on proper targeting.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","476-484","","6","66","","J Neurosurg Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 35301835","","","","*Deep Brain Stimulation/methods; *Essential Tremor/surgery; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; *Radiosurgery/methods; Humans; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the structural and functional  network changes induced by unilateral sonication of the ventral intermediate  nucleus in ET. METHODS: Fifteen essential tremor patients (66.2 ± 15.4 years)  underwent probabilistic tractography and functional magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) during unilateral postural tremor-eliciting tasks using 3-T MRI before, 1  month (N = 15), and 6 months (N = 10) post unilateral sonication. RESULTS:  Tractography identified tract-specific alterations within the  dentato-thalamo-cortical tract (DTCT) affected by the unilateral lesion after  sonication. Relative to the treated hand, task-evoked activation was  significantly reduced in contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex and  ipsilateral cerebellar lobules IV/V and VI, and vermis. Dynamic causal modeling  revealed a significant decrease in excitatory drive from the cerebellum to the  contralateral sensorimotor cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Thalamic lesions induced by  sonication induce specific functional network changes within the DTCT, notably  reducing excitatory input to ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex in ET. ©[2022]  International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. © 2022 The Authors.

The authors aimed to retrospectively investigate MRgFUS  ablation outcomes and associated factors and to define the cutoff values for each  prognostic factor. METHODS: Sixty-four Japanese patients who underwent unilateral  ventral intermediate nucleus thalamotomy with MRgFUS for ET were included.  Follow-up evaluations were performed at 1 week and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months  postoperatively. Tremor suppression was evaluated using the Clinical Rating Scale  for Tremor (CRST), and adverse effects were recorded postoperatively.  Outcome-associated factors were examined preoperatively, intraoperatively, and  postoperatively using multivariate analyses. The cutoff values for the prognostic  factors were calculated using receiver operating characteristics. RESULTS:  Percentage improvements in the CRST scores of the affected upper limb were 82.4%,  72.2%, 68.6%, and 65.9% at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Preoperatively,  a high skull density ratio (SDR) (p ≤ 0.047), low CRST part B score (used to  assess tremors during several tasks) (cutoff value 25, p ≤ 0.041), and  nonoccurrence of resting tremors (p = 0.027) were significantly associated with  improved tremor control. An intraoperatively high maximum mean temperature  (cutoff value 52.5°C, p ≤ 0.047), postoperatively large lesion (cutoff value 3.9  mm in the anterior-posterior direction, p ≤ 0.002; cutoff value 5.0-5.55 mm in  the superior-inferior direction, p ≤ 0.026), and small transducer focus  correction (p ≤ 0.015) were also associated with improved tremor control. No  valid cutoff value was found for SDR. Adverse effects (limb weakness, sensory  disturbance, ataxia/walking disturbance, dysgeusia, dysarthria, and facial  swelling) occurred transiently and were associated with high SDR, high  temperature, high number of sonication sessions, large lesion, and occurrence of  resting tremor. Patients who developed leg weakness experienced greater  percentage improvement in tremors at 3 months postoperatively than those who did  not. CONCLUSIONS: MRgFUS ablation could be used to achieve good tremor control  with acceptable adverse effects in Japanese patients with ET. The relatively low  SDR in Asian ethnic groups as compared with that of Western populations makes  treatment difficult; however, the cutoff values obtained in this study may be  useful for achieving good treatment outcomes even in such patients.

Real-time passive cavitation detection (PCD)-based feedback control of  the FUS sonication is critical to ensure effective BBB opening without causing  hemorrhage. This study evaluated the performance of a closed-loop feedback  controller in a porcine model. Calibration of the baseline cavitation level was  performed for each targeted brain location by a FUS sonication in the presence of  intravenously injected microbubbles at a low acoustic pressure without inducing  BBB opening. The target cavitation level (TCL) was defined for each target based  on the baseline cavitation level. FUS treatment was then performed under  real-time PCD-based feedback controller to maintain the cavitation level at the  TCL. After FUS treatment, contrast-enhanced MRI and ex vivo histological staining  were performed to evaluate the BBB permeability and safety. Safe and effective  BBB opening was achieved with the BBB opening volume increased from 3.8 ± 0.7 to  53.6 ± 23.3 mm(3) as the TCL was increased from 0.25 to 1 dB.

Based on the AE effect, a new  imaging method for the biological current source has been proposed, combining the  advantages of high temporal resolution of electrical measurements and high  spatial resolution of focused ultrasound. This paper first describes the  mechanism of the AE effect and the principle of the current source imaging method  based on the AE effect.

However, they face considerable challenges  regarding their delivery into the brain, mainly due to the blood-brain barrier  (BBB). By controlling the acoustic parameters, focused ultrasound combined with  microbubbles (FUS/MB) can temporarily, noninvasively, and reproducibly open the  BBB in a localized region. We investigated the delivery outcome of pH-responsive  DNA octahedra loading Epirubicin (Epr@DNA-Octa) via FUS/MB and its therapeutic  efficiency in a mouse model bearing intracranial glioma xenograft. Using FUS/MB  to locally disrupt the BBB or the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) and systemic  administration of Epr@DNA-Octa (Epr@DNA-Octa + FUS/MB) (2 mg/kg of loaded Epr),  we achieved an Epr concentration of 292.3 ± 10.1 ng/g tissue in glioma, a  4.4-fold increase compared to unsonicated animals (p < 0.001). The in vitro  findings indicated that Epr released from DNA strands accumulated in lysosomes  and induced enhanced cytotoxicity compared to free Epr. Further two-photon  intravital imaging of spatiotemporal patterns of the DNA-Octa leakage revealed  that the FUS/MB treatment enhanced DNA-Octa delivery across several physiological  barriers at microscopic level, including the first extravasation across the  BBB/BTB and then deep penetration into the glioma center and engulfment of  DNA-Octa into the tumor cell body. Longitudinal in vivo bioluminescence imaging  and histological analysis indicated that the intracranial glioma progression in  nude mice treated with Epr@DNA-Octa + FUS/MB was effectively retarded compared to  other groups. The beneficial effect on survival was most significant in the  Epr@DNA-Octa + FUS/MB group, with a 50% increase in median survival and a 73%  increase in the maximum survival compared to control animals. Our work  demonstrates the potential viability of FUS/MB as an alternative strategy for  glioma delivery of anticancer drugs using DNA nanostructures as the drug delivery  platform for brain cancer therapy.","2022-10","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","158-174","","","350","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

Improving the efficiency to generate  radicals of O(2) is a challenge currently. In this work, a strategy combining  physical method - ultrasound and nanomaterial with unique physicochemical  properties was designed to enhance the ECL signal of luminol-O(2) system.  Specifically, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) pretreatment as a  non-invasive method could generate ROS (H(2)O(2), O(2)(•-), OH•, (1)O(2)) in  situ, triggering and boosting the ECL signal of luminol. In addition, 1T/2H  MoS(2) with excellent catalytic activity could catalyze the H(2)O(2) produced in  situ, accelerate the oxidation of luminol and further enhance the ECL response.  At the same time, combined with the catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction,  the constructed ECL biosensing platform showed excellent performance for the  detection of miRNA-155. The concentration range of 0.1 fM ∼ 1 nM with the  detection limit as low as 0.057 fM were obtained. Furthermore, the ECL biosensor  was also successfully applied to the determination of miRNA-155 in human serum  samples.

In this study, we  propose a deep-learning-based network model that can provide spatial navigational  information of a single-element FUS transducer with respect to the targeted brain  region. The training dataset were acquired through forward simulations that  reflect the different tFUS transmissions for each skull structure using cranial  computed tomography (CT) image data. The performance of the network was evaluated  through three ex vivo calvaria. As a result show that the presented neural  network-based method can an accurately navigate the FUS transducer with the  conformity of ∼99.59% in placement of the transducer and ∼74.49% in the focal  volume and an average difference of ∼0.96 mm in the focal point, all capable of  real-time operation (∼10 ms).","2022-11","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","5653-5664","","11","26","","IEEE J Biomed Health Inform","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35969551","","","","*Brain/physiology; *Transducers; Acoustics; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Skull/diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this measure does not fully predict  the sonication parameters that would be required or the technical success rates.  The authors aimed to assess other skull characteristics that may also contribute  to technical success. METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied consecutive  patients with essential tremor who were treated by MRgFUS at their center between  2017 and 2021. They evaluated the correlation between the different treatment  parameters, particularly maximum power and energy delivered, with a range of  patients' skull metrics and demographics. Machine learning algorithms were  applied to investigate whether sonication parameters could be predicted from  skull density metrics alone and whether including combined local transducer SDRs  with overall calvarial SDR would increase model accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 62  patients were included in the study. The mean age was 77.1 (SD 9.2) years, and  78% of treatments (49/63) were performed in males. The mean SDR was 0.51 (SD  0.10). Among the evaluated metrics, SDR had the highest correlation with the  maximum power used in treatment (ρ = -0.626, p < 0.001; proportion of local SDR  values ≤ 0.8 group also had ρ = +0.626, p < 0.001) and maximum energy delivered  (ρ = -0.680, p < 0.001). Machine learning algorithms achieved a moderate ability  to predict maximum power and energy required from the local and overall SDRs  (accuracy of approximately 80% for maximum power and approximately 55% for  maximum energy), and high ability to predict average maximum temperature reached  from the local and overall SDRs (approximately 95% accuracy). CONCLUSIONS: The  authors compared a number of skull metrics against SDR and showed that SDR was  one of the best indicators of treatment parameters when used alone. In addition,  a number of other machine learning algorithms are proposed that may be explored  to improve its accuracy when additional data are obtained. Additional metrics  related to eventual sonication parameters should also be identified and explored.","2023-01-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","50-57","","1","138","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35901729","","","","*Essential Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Tremor; Aged; Humans; MR-guided focused ultrasound; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Retrospective Studies; Skull/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Thalamus/diagnostic imaging/surgery; essential tremor; functional neurosurgery; neuromodulation; skull density ratio; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NCCs can be obtained by simply mixing FDA-approved  cyclodextrins (CD) and suitable perfluorocarbons (PFCs), which result in smaller  size aggregates, detectable PFC amount, and more stable long-term storage since  the obtained powder can be stored and redispersed as needed. Previous  experimental and computational studies showed that NCCs consist of an  organization of inclusion complexes of CD and PFC around free PFC droplets, and  their aggregate behavior depends on the localization of PFC in the cavity and the  water solubility of CD derivatives. It has been shown that β-cyclodextrin (βCD)  and perfluorohexane (PFH) are ideal candidates for NCCs that can be isolated as a  powder with high PFC content among various CD and PFC derivatives. This study  focuses on the further development of the selected NCC composition to enhance the  potential of NMH therapy while also enabling more detailed future experiments in  vitro and in vivo. It is aimed to show the bioconjugation potential of NCCs  through the example of the most commonly used functionalization methods such as  targeting, PEGylation, and fluorescent labeling. For this purpose, βCD as a  building block was monofunctionalized with groups such as azide, alkyne, and  amine groups that allow for effective coupling reactions such as the ""click""  reaction and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide  hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) coupling. These monofunctional βCDs  were used as building blocks of NCCs in the presence of PFH to obtain functional  NCCs as precursors of bioconjugation. EPPT1 as a synthetic peptide specific to  uMUC1 and folic acid (FA) as the most commonly used targeting agent along with  PEGylation were successfully shown as bioconjugation examples. Lastly,  fluorescently labeled NCCs were obtained via fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)  and alkyne functional NCC reaction through propargyl amine and isothiocyanate  group reaction. The obtained bioconjugates were tested in vitro to validate the  conjugation, and the ability to lower the histotripsy cavitation threshold, which  is necessary for NMH, was demonstrated for all bioconjugates. Overall, the  results showed that all obtained bioconjugates successfully lowered the  cavitation threshold pressure while also fulfilling the desired bioconjugation  metrics to serve as improved tools to enhance NMH as a targeted noninvasive  ablation method.","2022-12-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","5297-5311","","12","23","","Biomacromolecules","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36418020","","","","*Fluorocarbons/chemistry; *Nanoparticles/chemistry; *beta-Cyclodextrins; Amines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the cancer is  organ-confined it can be treated by various ablative therapies such as RP  (radical prostatectomy), RT (radiation therapy), brachytherapy, cryosurgery or  HIFU (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound). However, advanced or metastatic PCa  treatment requires systemic therapy involving androgen deprivation, but such  patients typically progress to refractory disease designated as  castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been  established as a driver of prostate carcinogenesis and tumor progression while  less is known about the role of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a member of  the IL-6 cytokine family in prostate cancer. Moreover, MAPK/ERK, AKT/PI3K and  Jak/STAT pathways that regulate proliferative, invasive and glucose-uptake  processes in cancer progression are triggered by CNTF. METHODS: We investigate  CNTF and its receptor CNTFRα expressions in human androgen-responsive and  castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by immunohistochemistry.

Agar-based TMMs are often  developed mimicking the thermal properties of muscle tissue, while TMMs  simulating fat tissue properties are rarely developed. Herein, twelve agar-based  TMMs were iteratively developed with varied concentrations of agar, water,  glycerol and propan-2-ol, and characterized for their suitability in emulating  the thermal conductivity of human fat tissue. METHODS: Varied agar concentrations  (2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 12%, 16% and 20% w/v) were utilized for developing seven  water-based TMMs, while a 20% w/v agar concentration was utilized for developing  two water/alcohol-based TMMs (50% v/v water and 50% v/v either glycerol or  propan-2-ol) and three alcohol-based TMMs (varied glycerol and propan-2-ol  concentrations). Thermal conductivity was measured for all TMMs, and the tissue  mimicking material (TMM) exhibiting thermal conductivity closest to human fat was  considered the optimum fat TMM and was further characterized using ultrasound  (US) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). RESULTS: For the seven water-based  TMMs an inverse linear trend was observed between thermal conductivity and  increased agar concentration, being between 0.524 and 0.445 W/m K. Alcohol  addition decreased thermal conductivity of the two water/alcohol-based TMMs to  about 0.33 W/m K, while in the alcohol-based TMMs, increased concentrations of  propan-2-ol emerged as a modifier of thermal conductivity. The optimum fat TMM  (33.3% v/v glycerol and 66.7% v/v propan-2-ol) exhibited a 0.231 W/m K thermal  conductivity, and appeared hypoechoic on US images and with increased brightness  on T1-Weighted MRI images. CONCLUSION: The optimum fat TMM emulates the thermal  conductivity of human fat tissue and exhibits a fat-like appearance on US and MRI  images. The TMM is cost-effective and has a long lifespan and possesses great  potential for use in HIFU applications as a fat TMM.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","505-515","","2","26","","J Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Trauma is both penetrative and trivial, which can lead to carotid  artery dissection. In the current study, we present an unusual case in which  carotid artery dissection was potentially triggered by the damaging thermal  effect of 7D High-Intensity Macro- and Micro-Focused Ultrasound (7D HIFU), which  has been proposed as a safe and effective non-surgical modality for skin  rejuvenation. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old woman developed headache and clinical  manifestations of cerebral infarction after 7D HIFU, aimed at removing neckline.  Head and neck magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography  angiogram (CTA) revealed severe stenosis and dissection of the left internal  carotid artery. Neither the patient's history nor the physical examination showed  any special indicators. After resection of the left carotid artery dissection,  autologous great saphenous vein interposition grafting, and simple mastoidectomy,  the patient underwent head and neck MRA, which revealed recanalization of the  left internal carotid artery. CONCLUSION: Although mild or moderate complications  of 7D HIFU, such as erythema, edema, transient dysesthesia, and motor nerve  paresis, have been previously reported, a few previous literature studies  documented severe complications of the cosmetic procedure. However, many recent  studies pointed out the possibility of 7D HIFU damaging adjacent non-target  tissues due to inadequate focal depth of HIFU treatment. Our case is the first to  indicate that 7D HIFU could cause carotid artery dissection. We propose that  better visualization systems and more rigorous operator training are needed to  reduce the risk of the potential off-target damaging effect of 7D HIFU by  reporting the case in which the damaging heat effect of 7D HIFU precipitated the  carotid artery dissection HIFU.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","913754","","","9","","Front Cardiovasc Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Du, Shao, Lai, Li, Wang and Liu.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36061559  PMCID: PMC9433797","","","","7D High-Intensity Macro- and Micro-Focused Ultrasound; case report; peripheral vascular disease; surgery; traumatic carotid artery dissection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HIFU preoperative localization of uterine fibroids can be used  to determine whether the patient is a suitable candidate for HIFU treatment. This  study investigated the clinical significance of bladder training in improving the  success rate of HIFU preoperative localization uterine fibroids. MATERIAL AND  METHODS: Our sample consists of patients who planned to undergo HIFU treatment in  our hospital but who were failed in previous HIFU preoperative localization. They  were recruited between July 2021 and April 2022, and randomly divided into  experimental and control groups. A total of 150 patients were enrolled. Each  group consisted of 75 patients. The patients in the experimental group adopted  the procedure of drinking water multiple times and retaining urine. The training  program lasted three days. The patients in the control group were required to  keep regular drinking and urination habits without any special instructions or  requirements. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences  between the two groups in maximum bladder capacity, residual urine volume of  bladder, bladder filling levels, and bladder shape change. After bladder  training, the maximum bladder capacity and the degree bladder shape change of the  patients in the experimental group were improved significantly. The success rate  of HIFU preoperative localization in the patients in the experimental group was  significantly higher than that of the control group.

Low intensity focused ultrasound  (LiFUS) is a non-invasive technique to disrupt the BBB, though there is a lack of  understanding of the relationship between LiFUS parameters, such as cavitation  dose, time of sonication, microbubble dose, and the time course and magnitude of  BBB disruption. Discrepancies in these data arise from experimentation with  modified, clinically untranslatable transducers and inconsistent parameters for  sonication. In this report, we characterize microbubble and cavitation doses as  LiFUS variables as they pertain to the time course and size of BBB opening with a  clinical Insightec FUS system. METHODS: Female Nu/Nu athymic mice were exposed to  LiFUS using the ExAblate Neuro system (v7.4, Insightec, Haifa, Israel) following  target verification with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Microbubble and  cavitation doses ranged from 4-400 μL/kg, and 0.1-1.5 cavitation dose,  respectively. The time course and magnitude of BBB opening was evaluated using  fluorescent tracers, ranging in size from 105-10,000 Da, administered  intravenously at different times pre- or post-LiFUS. Quantitative autoradiography  and fluorescence microscopy were used to quantify tracer accumulation in brain.  RESULTS: We observed a microbubble and cavitation dose dependent increase in  tracer uptake within brain after LiFUS. Tracer accumulation was size dependent,  with (14)C-AIB (100 Da) accumulating to a greater degree than larger markers  (~ 625 Da-10 kDa). Our data suggest opening of the BBB via LiFUS is time  dependent and biphasic. Accumulation of solutes was highest when administered  prior to LiFUS mediated disruption (2-fivefold increases), but was also  significantly elevated at 6 h post treatment for both (14)C-AIB and Texas Red.  CONCLUSION: The magnitude of LiFUS mediated BBB opening correlates with  concentration of microbubbles, cavitation dose as well as time of tracer  administration post-sonication. These data help define the window of maximal BBB  opening and applicable sonication parameters on a clinically translatable and  commercially available FUS system that can be used to improve passive  permeability and accumulation of therapeutics targeting the brain.","2022-09-08","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","72","","1","19","","Fluids Barriers CNS","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

In this clinical trial, the  feasibility and safety of BBB modulation in the putamen were evaluated for  biweekly therapeutic agent delivery in patients with Parkinson's disease. The  performance of the clinical MRgFUS system's cavitation feedback controller for  active power modulation throughout the exposures was examined. The putamen was  targeted unilaterally by an ExAblate Neuro MRgFUS system operating at 220 kHz.  Definity microbubbles were infused via a saline bag gravity drip at a rate of 4  µL/kg per 5 min. A cavitation emissions-based feedback controller was employed to  modulate the acoustic power automatically according to prescribed target  cavitation dose levels. BBB opening was measured by Gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced  T1-weighted MR imaging, and the presence of potential micro-hemorrhages induced  by the exposures was assessed via T2*-weighted MR imaging. A total of 12  treatment sessions were carried out across four patients, with target cavitation  dose levels ranging from 0.20-0.40. BBB permeability in the targeted putamen was  elevated successfully in all treatments, with a 14% ± 6% mean increase in  Gd-enhanced T1-weighted MRI signal intensity relative to the untreated  contralateral side. No indications of red blood cell extravasations were observed  on MR imaging scans acquired one day following each treatment session. The  cavitation emissions-based feedback controller was effective in modulating  acoustic power levels to ensure BBB permeability enhancement while avoiding  micro-hemorrhages, however, further technical advancements are warranted to  improve its performance for use across a wide variety of brain diseases.","2022-11-26","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","12","14","","Pharmaceutics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36559101  PMCID: PMC9781334","","","","Parkinson’s disease; blood-brain barrier opening; cavitation dose; focused ultrasound; microbubble infusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Magnetic resonance imaging showed temporary T1 contrast  enhancement in the sonication area, verifying the BBB opening. Several low-signal  intensity spots were observed in the T2 susceptibility-weighted angiography  images, which were also reversible and temporary.

Previous work has demonstrated the acoustic PCD response of MBs at a  variety of acoustic parameters, but few have explored variations in microbubble  parameters. The goal of this study was to determine the acoustic response of  different MB size populations and concentrations. Four MB size distributions were  prepared (2, 3, 5 µm diameter and polydisperse) and pulled through a 2% agar  wall-less vessel phantom. FUS was applied by a 1.515 MHz geometrically focused  transducer for 1 ms pulses at 1 Hz PRF and seven distinct mechanical indices (MI)  ranging from 0.01 to 1.0 (0.0123 to 1.23 MPa PNP). We found that the onset of  harmonic (HCD) and broadband cavitation dose (BCD) depends on the mechanical  index, MB size and MB concentration. When matched for MI, the HCD and BCD rise,  plateau, and decline as microbubble concentration is increased. Importantly, when  microbubble size and concentration are combined into gas volume fraction, all  four microbubble size distributions align to similar onset and peak; these  results may help guide the planning and control of MB + FUS therapeutic  procedures.","2022-09-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","9","14","","Pharmaceutics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36145673  PMCID: PMC9501432","","","","focused ultrasound; inertial cavitation; passive cavitation detection; size-isolated microbubbles; stable cavitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, MBs range in size of microns and thus can hardly  extravasate into the brain parenchyma. Recently, growing attention has been paid  to gas vesicles (GVs), which are genetically encoded gas-filled nanostructures  with protein shells, due to their potential for extravascular targeting in  ultrasound imaging and therapy. However, the use of GVs as agents for BBB opening  has not yet been investigated. METHODS: In this study, GVs were extracted and  purified from Halobacterium NRC-1. Ultrasound imaging performance of GVs was  assessed in vitro and in vivo. Then, FUS/GVs-mediated BBB opening for small  molecular Evans blue or large molecular liposome delivery across the BBB was  examined. RESULTS: The results showed a good contrast performance of GVs for  brain perfusion ultrasound imaging in vivo. At the acoustic negative pressure of  1.5 MPa, FUS/GVs opened the BBB safely, and effectively enhanced Evans blue and  200-nm liposome delivery into the brain parenchyma.

The cumulative  incidence of late GU Grade 2 or greater toxicity after five years was  significantly different between the non-HIFU and HIFU cohorts with rates of 7.3%  and 26.2%, respectively (P = 0.03). Regarding GI Grade 2 or greater toxicity,  there was no significant difference between the two cohorts. The 5y-BCFS was  84.2% in the non-HIFU cohort and 69.5% in the HIFU cohort with no significant  difference (P = 0.10) and the 5y-OS was 95.9% and 92.3%, respectively (P = 0.47).  We concluded that the possibility of increased late GU Grade 2 or greater should  be considered when applying salvage radiotherapy for local recurrence after HIFU.","2022-07-19","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","675-683","","4","63","","J Radiat Res","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2022.

Our aim was to assess cognitive changes  following MRgFUS thalamotomy to better investigate its safety profile. METHODS:  We prospectively investigated the cognitive and neurobehavioral profile of  patients consecutively undergoing MRgFUS within a 2-year period. Patients had a  comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment before and six months  after MRgFUS thalamotomy. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 40 patients  (males 38; mean age±SD 67.7 ± 10.7; mean disease duration±SD 9.3 ± 5.6; ET 22, PD  18 patients).

Acoustic  lenses were designed to correct the skull-induced beam aberration, but these  designs could only generate static focused ultrasound beams inside the brain.  Here, we designed and 3D printed binary acoustic metasurfaces (BAMs) for skull  aberration correction and dynamic ultrasound beam focusing. BAMs were designed by  binarizing the phase distribution at the surface of the metasurfaces. The phase  distribution was calculated based on time reversal to correct the skull-induced  phase aberration. The binarization enabled the ultrasound beam to be dynamically  steered along wave propagation direction by adjusting the operation frequency of  the incident ultrasound wave. The designed BAMs were manufactured by 3D printing  with two coding bits, a polylactic acid unit for bit ""1"" and a water unit for bit  ""0."" BAMs for single- and multi-point focusing through the human skull were  designed, 3D printed, and validated numerically and experimentally. The proposed  BAMs with subwavelength scale in thickness are simple to design, easy to fabric,  and capable of correcting skull aberration and achieving dynamic beam steering.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","984953","","","16","","Front Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Hu, Yang, Xu, Hao and Chen.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36117633  PMCID: PMC9475195","","","","FUS-BBBD; aberration correction; acoustic lens; beam steering; binary acoustic metasurface; dynamic focusing; neuromodulation; transcranial focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the clinical  progression of PC, the therapy is becoming more complex. The immunosuppressive  tumor microenvironment (TME) makes PC a difficult target for most  immunotherapeutics. Its general immune resistance is established by e.g., immune  evasion through Treg cells, synthesis of immunosuppressive mediators, and the  defective expression of surface neoantigens. The success of sipuleucel-T in  clinical trials initiated several other clinical studies that specifically target  the immune escape of tumors and eliminate the immunosuppressive properties of the  TME. In the settings of PC treatment, this can be commonly achieved with  radiation therapy (RT). In addition, focal therapies usually applied for  localized PC, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy,  cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and irreversible electroporation (IRE)  were shown to boost the anti-cancer response. Nevertheless, the present  guidelines restrict their application to the context of a clinical trial or a  prospective cohort study. This review explains how RT and focal therapies enhance  the immune response.

In the literature, interleukin-12 (IL-12) encoding plasmid associated  with sonoporation has been shown to enhance antitumoral activity. Moreover,  non-viral carriers and high-frequency ultrasound have both been shown to promote  immune response activation. Here, IL-12 encoding plasmid, non-viral carrier  stimulating the immune response and focused ultrasound were combined in order to  improve the antitumoral efficiency. METHODS: In order to enhance a gene-based  antitumoral immune response, home-made lipids Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)  agonists and plasmid free of antibiotic resistance version 4 (pFAR4), a  mini-plasmid, encoding the IL-12 cytokine were combined with high-intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU). The lipid composition and the combination conditions  were selected following in vitro and in vivo preliminary studies. The expression  of IL-12 from our plasmid construct was measured in vitro and in vivo. The  combination strategy was evaluated in mice bearing colon carcinoma cells (CT26)  tumors following their weight, tumor volume, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor  necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels in the serum and produced by splenocytes  exposed to CT26 tumor cells. RESULTS: Lipid-mediated cell transfection and  intratumoral injection into CT26 tumor mice using pFAR4-IL-12 led to the  secretion of the IL-12 cytokine into cell supernatant and mice sera,  respectively. Conditions of thermal deposition using HIFU were optimized. The  plasmid encoding pFAR4-IL-12 or TLR2 agonist alone had no impact on tumor growth  compared with control mice, whereas the complete treatment consisting of  pFAR4-IL-12, TLR2 lipid agonist, and HIFU limited tumor growth. Moreover, only  the complete treatment increased significantly mice survival and provided an  abscopal effect on a metastatic CT26 model. CONCLUSIONS: The HIFU condition was  highly efficient to stop tumor growth. The combined therapy was the most  efficient in terms of IL-12 and IFN-γ production and mice survival. The study  showed the feasibility and the limits of this combined therapy which has the  potential to be improved.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","398-413","","6","3","","Explor Target Antitumor Ther","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2022.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36046055  PMCID: PMC9400762","","","","Gene delivery; Toll-like receptor 2-agonists; cancer; combined therapy; immunotherapy; therapeutic ultrasound; transfection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HIFU may be indicated as a primary treatment for low-  or intermediate-risk prostate cancer, and salvage therapy for local recurrence as  a promising way to address the limitations of current standard therapies. The  application of HIFU in treating kidney tumors has scarcely been reported with  unsatisfactory results. Evidence indicates that low-intensity shockwave therapy  improves subjective and objective erectile function in patients with erectile  dysfunction. Regarding the application of ultrasound in stone management, the  novel combination of ultrasound lithotripsy and other energy sources in a single  probe promises to be a game-changer in efficiently disintegrating large kidney  stones in percutaneous nephrolithotomy. ESWL is losing its role in managing upper  urinary tract calculi worldwide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study. Seven  patients with cervical pregnancy who visited the Third Xiangya Hospital of  Central South University from January 2015 to December 2020 were enrolled in the  current study. All seven patients were treated with HIFU under conscious  sedation. All of them underwent HGSC at an average of 2 ± 1 days (range:  1-3 days) after HIFU. Before the therapy, the patient's clinical characteristics  were collected, including duration of amenorrhea, gravidity and parity, the  patient history of cesarean section and miscarriage, and the size of the  gestational sac. The levels of β-hCG and hemoglobin in serum were also reviewed.  To assess the clinical outcomes of this combined treatment, the suction time of  HGSC, bleeding volume, the clearance time of β-hCG, and the time with returning  of menstruation were evaluated. RESULTS: All seven patients (average age:  31 ± 6 years) have experienced amenorrhea (duration range, 48 ± 8 days) before  the treatment of HIFU. The average number of pregnancies was four, and the number  of deliveries was one. Previous medical history showed six patients had cesarean  sections, and five patients have been miscarriages. After HIFU treatment, the  fetal heartbeats were stopped in all seven patients based on the diagnosis by  doppler ultrasound. The bleeding of gestational tissue decreased significantly.  All patients had only mild lower abdominal pain, no fever, intestinal damage, or  other complications were reported. The average operation time of operative  suction curettage was 21 ± 9 min (range: 9-32 min), and the median bleeding  volume was 10 ± 8 mL (range: 2-20 mL). Follow-up observations showed that the  menstruations were returned in patients at an average of 38 ± 9 days (range:  30-50 days) after the treatment.

METHODS:  Patients pathologically diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer were  included. Low (Isppa = 1.5 kW/cm(2)), intermediate (2.0 kW/cm(2)), and high (2.5  kW/cm(2)) FUS intensity treatment groups were predefined. A 1% duty cycle and the  3+3 scheme were used. Six combined treatments were performed, and adverse events  were assessed. Changes in tumor size and tumor response, CA 19-9 level, and  patient-reported outcomes at the immediate follow-up (F/U) and/or at the 3-month  F/U and survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Three participants were enrolled in  each intensity group. No adverse device effect or dose-limiting toxicity occurred  in any of the participants. Seven of the nine participants experienced a >15%  tumor size decrease at the immediate F/U CT and at the 3-month F/U CT. The CA  19-9 level decreased in all of the participants at the immediate F/U. All  participants in the intermediate-intensity treatment group showed a > 30% tumor  size decrease, partial response, and a significant decrease in the CA 19-9 level  at 3-month F/U and longer survival (p < 0.05).

METHODS: From January 2015 to October 2021, 36 patients with CP  were diagnosed, treated, and followed up at the Department of Gynecology of Third  Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. A total of 11 patients were treated  with HIFU followed by suction curettage under hysteroscopic guidance, and 25  patients were treated with UAE followed by suction curettage under hysteroscopic  guidance. Medical records and pregnancy outcomes were retrospectively analyzed.  RESULTS: Compared to the UAE group, the HIFU group had a shorter interval time  (1.5 ± 0.21 days vs. 2.6 ± 0.26 days), shorter duration of hospitalization (5.5 ±  0.31 days vs. 6.6 ± 0.21 days), shorter recovery time of menstruation (30.6 ±  7.09 days vs. 36.9 ± 5.54 days), fewer adverse reactions (0/11 vs. 9/25), and  fewer postoperative complications (1/11 vs. 8/25). There were no significant  differences in age, gravidity, parity, abortion, gestational age, cardiac  pulsation, admission symptoms, hemoglobin level, largest diameter of the  sac/mass, serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level at admission,  hospitalization expenses, hospitalization days, blood loss during curettage,  degree of hCG decline, residue after curettage, fertility requirement, and  pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSION: Both HIFU and UAE are safe and effective in the  treatment of patients with CP. Compared to UAE, HIFU treatment for CP is a safer  and more effective therapeutic schedule owing to the advantages of being more  minimally invasive, shorter interval time, shorter hospitalization days and  recovery time of menstruation, fewer adverse reactions, and fewer postoperative  complications.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","990066","","","9","","Front Med (Lausanne)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Li, Gan, Kashyap, Zou, Zhang and Xu.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36186779  PMCID: PMC9522970","","","","cervical pregnancy (CP); clinical curative effect; high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation (HIFU); hysteroscopic curettage; uterine artery embolization (UAE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The traditional ultrasound layer  matching material is called a couplant, which can only enhance ultrasound  transmission to soft biological media such as the cartilage and muscle but cannot  penetrate hard media such as the bone. Here, we propose a phase-modulated  complementary acoustic metamaterial based on the principle of impedance matching,  which enables ultrasound to penetrate the bone, and use the equivalent parameter  technology of acoustic metamaterials for parameter design. Ultrasonic layer  adjustment is performed through 3D printing and corrects bone aberrations.  Several configurations were investigated through numerical simulations and  experiments in non-reflecting tanks. Specifically, the bone matching layer can be  optimally designed for a specific bone thickness and a specific operating  frequency of the ultrasound probe, thereby amplifying the ultrasound to penetrate  the matching layer and bone. The experimental and simulation results show that  the proposed acoustic metamaterial can improve the transmission efficiency of  ultrasound through the aberration layer.","2022-06-29","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","28604-28614","","25","14","","ACS Appl Mater Interfaces","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35726703","","","","*Acoustics; *Transducers; Computer Simulation; Electric Impedance; HIFU; Ultrasonography/methods; acoustic metamaterial; complementary aberrating layers; double-negative metamaterials; focused ultrasound; impedance matching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, its applicability is constrained by side effects resulting from the  insertion of electrodes into the brain. Here, we show that systemically  administered piezoelectric nanoparticles producing nitric oxide and generating  direct current under high-intensity focused ultrasound can be used to stimulate  deep tissue in the brain. The release of nitric oxide temporarily disrupted tight  junctions in the blood-brain barrier, allowing for the accumulation of the  nanoparticles into brain parenchyma, and the piezoelectrically induced output  current stimulated the release of dopamine by dopaminergic neuron-like cells. In  a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, the ultrasound-responsive nanoparticles  alleviated the symptoms of the disease without causing overt toxicity. The  strategy may inspire the development of other minimally invasive therapies for  neurodegenerative diseases.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","149-163","","2","7","","Nat Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

New  molecular targets, biomarkers, and diagnostic techniques, as well as alternative  nonpharmacological approaches, are sorely needed to detect and treat early  pathological events. This article analyzes the successes and debacles of  pharmaceutical endeavors to date, and highlights new technologies that may lead  to the more effective diagnosis and treatment of the pathologies that underlie  AD. The use of focused ultrasound, deep brain stimulation, stem cell therapy, and  gene therapy, in parallel with pharmaceuticals and judicious lifestyle  adjustments, holds promise for the deceleration, prevention, or cure of AD and  other neurodegenerative disorders.","2022-04","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1027-1043","","4","27","","Drug Discov Today","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
