METHODS: The clinical pilot study was  performed on 10 participants diagnosed with lumbar zygapophyseal joint syndrome.  Each participant had a documented positive response to a diagnostic block or a  previous, clinically beneficial radiofrequency ablation. For a descriptive study,  the primary outcome was the safety question. All device- or procedure-related  adverse events were collected. Secondary outcome variables included the average  numeric rating scale for pain, the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, the  Brief Pain Inventory, the Patient Global Impression of Change, the morphine  equivalent dose, and the finding of the neurological examination. RESULTS: All  participants tolerated the procedure well with no significant device- or  procedure-related adverse events; there was one episode of transient pain during  the procedure. The average numeric rating scale score for pain decreased from 6.2  at baseline to 2.1 (n = 10) after 1 month, 4.9 (n = 9) after 3 months, 3.0  (n = 8) after 6 months, and 3.0 (n = 6) after 12 months. The ratio of  participants who were considered a treatment success was 90% at 1 month, 50% at  3 months, 60% at 6 months, and 40% at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The first clinical  pilot study using a noninvasive, fluoroscopy-guided, high-intensity focused  ultrasound lumbar zygapophyseal neurotomy resulted in no significant device- or  procedure-related adverse events and achieved clinical success comparable with  that of routine radiofrequency ablation.","2022-01-03","2024-03-06 17:04:36","2024-03-06T17:04:36Z","","67-75","","1","23","","Pain Med","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2021.

Upper cranial nerves such as  the trigeminal nerve and other nerves responsible for sensory/motor functions in  the head may be potential targets for ultrasound pain therapy. The location of  upper cranial nerves close to the skull base poses additional challenges when  compared with conventional cortical or middle brain targets. In the work  described here, a series of computational and empirical testing methods using  human skull specimens were conducted to assess the feasibility of sonicating the  trigeminal pathway near the sphenoid bone region. The results indicate a  transducer with a focal length of 120 mm and diameter of 85 mm (350 kHz) can  deliver sonication to upper cranial nerve regions with spatial accuracy  comparable to that of focused ultrasound brain targets used in previous human  studies. Temperature measurements in cortical bone and in the skull base with  embedded thermocouples yield evidence of minimal bone heating. Conventional pulse  parameters were found to cause reverberation interference patterns near the  cranial floor; therefore, changes in pulse cycles and pulse repetition frequency  were examined for reducing standing waves. Limitations and considerations for  conducting ultradeep focal targeting in human applications are discussed.","2022-06","2024-03-06 17:04:33","2024-03-06T17:04:33Z","","1045-1057","","6","48","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Although the skull is a major determinant of the delivery of acoustic energy to  the target, how the presence of a prior craniotomy must be accounted for during  lesioning is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate novel application of this  therapeutic option in a patient with a history of prior craniotomies for  unrelated intracranial pathologies. METHODS: A 55-yr-old man with a history of  right frontal craniotomy for resection of a colloid cyst underwent a left  ventrointermedius nucleus thalamotomy through MRgFUS. The prior craniotomy flap  was not excluded in the treatment plan; however, all bony defects and hardware  were marked as ""no-pass"" regions. Clinical outcomes were collected at the 6-mo  follow-up. RESULTS: Transducer elements whose acoustic paths would have been  altered by the craniotomy defect were turned off. Sonications reaching lesional  temperatures of up to 56°C were successfully delivered. The procedure was  well-tolerated, without any persistent intra-ablation or postablation adverse  effects. The presence of a lesion was confirmed on MRI, which was associated with  a significant reduction in the patient's tremor that was sustained at the 6-mo  follow-up. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the safety and efficacy of MRgFUS  thalamotomy in a patient with prior craniotomies and highlights our strategy for  acoustic lesioning in this setting.","2022-02-01","2024-03-06 17:04:28","2024-03-06T17:04:28Z","","61-65","","2","22","","Oper Neurosurg (Hagerstown)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2021.

METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after USg-HIFU.  Information on clinical characteristics of patients, MRI characteristics of  lesions, and treatment outcomes were collected. Thirty AWE lesions in 29 patients  were examined before HIFU treatment, while 27 patients were examined after  treatment. The results of MRI and color doppler ultrasound before surgery, as  well as the volume and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the  lesions before and after USg-HIFU treatment were compared. We also observed the  clinical symptoms remission, recurrence, and ablation rates of the lesions in  follow-up after HIFU treatment. RESULTS: The locations of the 30 AWE lesions were  identified by MRI before USg-HIFU treatment. Their sizes appeared larger on MRI  than ultrasound (P < 0.05). A total of 27 lesions were evaluated by MRI after  USg-HIFU treatment, of which 92.6% (25/27) lesions were of high or slightly high  signal intensity on T1-weighted images, and 77.8% (21/27) lesions were of mixed  signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The mean ADC values of AWE lesions were  1.47 (1.20-1.59) × 10(-3)mm(2)/s and 1.86 (1.61-2.12) × 10(-3)mm(2)/s for pre-and  post-HIFU treatment (P < 0.05).

At present no effective treatment options are available; current  therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) improve cognitive symptoms only  transiently and in a minor number of patients. Further, most of the amyloid-based  phase III clinical trials recently failed in AD, in spite of promising  preclinical and phase I-II clinical trials, further pinpointing the need for a  better knowledge of the early mechanisms of disease as well as of more effective  routes of drug administration. In fact, beyond common pathological events and  molecular substrates, each of these diseases preferentially affect defined  subpopulations of neurons in specific neuronal circuits (selective neuronal  vulnerability), leading to the typical age-related clinical profile. In this  perspective, key to successful drug discovery is a robust and reproducible  biological validation of potential new molecular targets together with a  concomitant set up of protocols/tools for efficient and targeted brain delivery  to a specific area of interest. Here we propose and discuss Focused UltraSound  aided drug administration as a specific and novel technical approach to achieve  optimal concentration of the drug at the target area of interest. We will focus  on drug delivery to the brain through the nasal route coupled to FUS as a  promising approach to achieve neuroprotection and rescue of cognitive decline in  several NDs.","2022","2024-03-06 17:04:20","2024-03-06T17:04:20Z","","786475","","","13","","Front Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Barbato, Nisticò and Triaca.","","","","","","PMID: 35496270  PMCID: PMC9046653","","","","brain circuit vulnerability; clinical trials; drug delivery; focused ultrasound; neurodegenerative diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The angular spectrum approach (ASA) potentially offers a very efficient  method to perform PAM, as it can reconstruct specific frequency bands pertinent  to microbubble dynamics and may be extended to correct aberrations caused by the  skull. Here, we experimentally assess the abilities of heterogeneous ASA (HASA)  to perform trans-skull PAM. Our experimental investigations demonstrate that the  3-D PAMs of a known 1-MHz source, constructed with HASA through an ex vivo human  skull segment, reduced both the localization error (from 4.7 ± 2.3 to 2.3 ± 1.6  mm) and the number, size, and energy of spurious lobes caused by aberration, with  the modest additional computational expense. While further improvements in the  localization errors are expected with arrays with denser elements and larger  aperture, our analysis revealed that experimental constraints associated with the  array pitch and aperture (here, 1.8 mm and 2.5 cm, respectively) can be  ameliorated by interpolation and peak finding techniques. Beyond the array  characteristics, our analysis also indicated that errors in the registration  (translation and rotation of ±5 mm and ±5°, respectively) of the skull segment to  the array can lead to peak localization errors of the order of a few wavelengths.  Interestingly, errors in the spatially dependent speed of sound in the skull  (±20%) caused only subwavelength errors in the reconstructions, suggesting that  registration is the most important determinant of point source localization  accuracy. Collectively, our findings show that HASA can address source  localization problems through the skull efficiently and accurately under  realistic conditions, thereby creating unique opportunities for imaging and  controlling the microbubble dynamics in the brain.","2022-02","2024-03-06 17:04:19","2024-03-06T17:04:19Z","","534-542","","2","69","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34748486","","","","*Microbubbles; *Skull/diagnostic imaging; Acoustics; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Humans; Sound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A retrospective single-center observational study  was conducted. A total of 41 patients diagnosed with exogenous CSP were enrolled  in this study. All patients received HIFU combined with suction curettage.  RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were administered one session of HIFU ablation. In  addition, the other 12 patients received 2 HIFU sessions. Suction curettage was  performed in all patients after HIFU, and no patient was converted to laparoscopy  or hysterectomy. The mean blood loss during suction curettage was 99 ml. Three  patients received two sessions of suction curettage. The success rate of our  study was 92.68%. The mean time for serum β-HCG normalization was  23.18 ± 3.13 days. The average menstruation recovery time was 29.38 ± 3.34 days.  Based on the blood loss during suction curettage, 41 patients were divided into a  bleeding group and a control group. The size of the gestational sac in the  bleeding group (3.80 ± 0.87 cm) was larger than that in the control group  (3.39 ± 0.77 cm) (P < 0.05). The thickness of the myometrium between the bladder  and gestational sac in the bleeding group (2.37 ± 0.89 mm) was less than that in  the control group (2.75 ± 0.75 mm) (P < 0.05).

The mean PBAC scores at 3, 6 and 12  months posttreatment were reduced by 50.8%, 48.4% and 42.8%, respectively, in the  AUB-L group and by 50.9%, 53.8% and 47.9%, respectively, in the AUB-A group.  Compared with the baseline, at 3, 6 and 12 months posttreatment, the HRQL score  increased by 41.5%, 43.3% and 33.3%, respectively, in the AUB-L group and by  24.7%, 31.1% and 28.2%, respectively, in the AUB-A group. CONCLUSION: MRgFUS is  an effective and safe noninvasive uterine-sparing treatment modality in the  management of AUB-L and AUB-A. MRgFUS can target lesion for ablation effectively,  remove the factors that lead to AUB, retain a normal menstrual cycle, relieve AUB  symptoms significantly and improve quality of life.","2022","2024-03-06 17:04:04","2024-03-06T17:04:04Z","","656-663","","1","14","","Am J Transl Res","","","","","","","","eng","AJTR Copyright © 2022.","","","","","","PMID: 35173883  PMCID: PMC8829638","","","","Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery; abnormal uterine bleeding; adenomyosis; leiomyoma; uterine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Thirty patients with benign thyroid nodules were  treated with HIFU under general or regional anesthesia at two centers from 2014  to 2019. During HIFU, a therapeutic ultrasound probe, EchoPulse (Teraclion,  Malakoff, France), heats the focus to 80-90 degrees Celsius. Nodal volumes were  measured by ultrasound before and 3 months after therapy. For statistical  analysis, the total population was divided into two groups according to the  anesthesia performed. In a retrospective long-term multicenter study, volume  reduction and the energy delivered were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank  test and the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: At three months follow-up, the total  study population had an average volume reduction of 39.26% (range 4.03-91.16%,  p < 0.001, n = 30), the general anesthesia group of 47.46% (range 13.64-91.16%,  p = 0.001, n = 15) and the regional anesthesia group of 31.06% (range  4.03-68.63%, p = 0.001, n = 15). Under regional anesthesia a median energy of  3.16 kJ/cm(3) (range: 0.96 - 8.2 kJ/cm(3)) and under general anesthesia a median  energy of 0.88 kJ/cm(3) (range: 0.18 - 1.63 kJ/cm(3)) were delivered. All results  were significant with p < 0.05. The complication rate was 6.67%. CONCLUSION: HIFU  is an effective method to treat benign thyroid nodules.

Dry needling (DN) is widely used to manage  pain and function after injury. However, DN is invasive and high  inter-practitioner variability has led to mixed success rates. Focused ultrasound  (fUS) is a non-invasive medical technology that directs ultrasound energy into a  well-defined focal volume. fUS can induce thermal ablation or mechanical  fractionation, with bioeffect type controlled through ultrasound parameters.  Tendons must withstand high physiological loads, thus treatments maintaining  tendon mechanical properties while promoting healing are needed. Our objective  was to evaluate mechanical effects of DN and 3 fUS parameter sets, chosen to  prioritize mechanical fractionation, on Achilles and supraspinatus tendons. Ex  vivo rat Achilles and supraspinatus tendons (50 each) were divided into sham, DN,  fUS-1, fUS-2, and fUS-3 (n = 10/group). Following treatment, tendons were  mechanically tested. Elastic modulus of supraspinatus tendons treated with DN  (126.64 ± 28.1 MPa) was lower than sham (153.02 ± 29.3 MPa; p = 0.0280).  Stiffness and percent relaxation of tendons treated with DN (Achilles:  114.40 ± 31.6 N/mm; 49.10 ± 6.1%; supraspinatus: 109.53 ± 30.8 N/mm;  50.17 ± 7.6%) were lower (all p < 0.0334) than sham (Achilles:  141.34 ± 20.9 N/mm; 60.30 ± 7.7%; supraspinatus: 135.14 ± 30.2 N/mm;  60.85 ± 15.4%). Modulus of Achilles and supraspinatus tendons treated with fUS-1  (159.88 ± 25.7 MPa; 150.12 ± 22.0 MPa, respectively) were similar to sham  (156.35 ± 23.0 MPa; 153.02 ± 29.3 MPa, respectively). These results suggest that  fUS preserves mechanical properties better than DN, with fUS-1 performing better  than fUS-2 and fUS-3. fUS should be studied further to fully understand its  mechanical and healing effects to help evaluate fUS as an alternative,  non-invasive treatment for tendon injuries.","2022-02","2024-03-06 17:03:58","2024-03-06T17:03:58Z","","110934","","","132","","J Biomech","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Patients with  biopsy-confirmed CIN were recruited for focused ultrasound treatment and asked to  return during 3-6 and 6-12 months post-treatment to receive cervical cytology,  high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) detection, and colposcopy. The effective  rate was evaluated within 3-6 months, whereas the recurrence rate was evaluated  within 6-12 months. Cervicovaginal lavage and cervical tissue were sampled before  and 3-6 months after treatment. The expression of interferon gamma (IFN-γ),  endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), human leucocyte antigen I  (HLA-I), cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), and cluster of differentiation 8  (CD8) in the cervical tissue were observed by immunohistochemistry.  Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) levels in the cervicovaginal  lavage were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Comparisons were made  in immune analyte levels before and after treatment. RESULTS: We analyzed the  results of 154 patients. The effective rate at 3-6 months was 96.8%. The  recurrence rate at 6-12 months was 2.0%. The eradication rate of HPV was 72.4% at  3-6 months and 81.0% at 6-12 months. No serious adverse reactions and  complications were observed. After treatment, a higher expression of ERAP1 was  observed (p < 0.05). Significant down-regulation of IgA and IL-10 were detected  (each p < 0.05). However, the expression of CD4, CD8, HLA-I, as well as the  release of IFN-γ, did not reach statistical significance (each p > 0.05).

Although dysgeusia  persisted and caused substantial weight loss, tremor slowly relapsed. Therefore, 19  months after the first procedure, the patient underwent a second focused ultrasound  thalamotomy procedure, which again improved tremor but also completely resolved the  dysgeusia.

It is essential to identify and provide  warnings earlier for tumour metastasis to carry out effective clinical  interventions. In addition, traditional cancer chemotherapy encounters drastic  limitations due to the nonspecific delivery of antitumour drugs and severe side  effects. We aimed to exploit the potential of gelsolin (GSN) monoclonal antibody  as a targeting agent and perfluorohexane (PFH) as a phase-transition agent to  maximize the cytotoxic effect of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)  nanoparticle-based drug controllable release systems for Hca-F cells. METHODS: We  co-encapsulated PFH and doxorubicin (DOX) into PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) and  further conjugated GSN monoclonal antibody onto the surface of NPs to form  GSN-targeted phase transition polymer NPs (GSN-PLGA-PFH-DOX) for both imaging and  therapy of tumours and metastatic lymph nodes. To promote and trigger drug  release on demand, low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) was applied to achieve  a controllable release of the encapsulated drug. RESULTS: GSN-PLGA-PFH-DOX NPs  exhibited characteristics such as a narrow size distribution and smooth surface.  GSN-PLGA-PFH-DOX NPs could also specifically bind to Hca-F cells and increase the  ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) image contrast intensity. GSN-PLGA-PFH-DOX NPs  enable GSN-mediated targeting and biotherapeutic effects as well as  LIFU-responsive drug release, resulting in synergistic cytotoxic effects in  GSN-overexpressing cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our work might provide a strategy  for the imaging and chemotherapy of primary tumours and their metastases.","2022","2024-03-06 17:03:49","2024-03-06T17:03:49Z","","61-71","","","17","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Qin et al.","","","","","","PMID: 35023919  PMCID: PMC8747719","","","","*Gelsolin; *Nanoparticles; Cell Line, Tumor; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Liberation; Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer; controllable drug release; gelsolin; phase transition; poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients with 78 breast  fibroadenomas who underwent USgHIFU were retrospectively analyzed. The energy  efficiency factor (EEF) was set as dependent variable, and the factors possibly  influencing the sonication dosage, including age, body mass index (BMI),  fibroadenoma size, distance from the shallow margin of the fibroadenoma to skin,  distance from the deep margin of the fibroadenoma to pectoralis major, types of  near field acoustic pathway, and Adler blood flow classification of ultrasound,  were set as independent variables.

We  hypothesized focused ultrasound's effects on action potential parameters may be  similar to those of local anesthetics. METHODS: In an ex vivo rat sciatic nerve  model, action potential amplitude, area under the curve, latency to 10% peak,  latency to 100% peak, rate of rise, and half peak width changes were assessed  after separately applying increasing focused ultrasound pressures or  concentrations of bupivacaine and ropivacaine. Focused ultrasound's effects on  nerve structure were examined histologically. RESULTS: Increasing focused  ultrasound pressures decreased action potential amplitude, area under the curve,  and rate of rise, increased latency to 10% peak, and did not change latency to  100% peak or half peak width. Increasing local anesthetic concentrations  decreased action potential amplitude, area under the curve, and rate of rise and  increased latency to 10% peak, latency to 100% peak, and half peak width. At the  highest focused ultrasound pressures, nerve architecture was altered compared  with controls. DISCUSSION: While some action potential parameters were altered  comparably by focused ultrasound and local anesthetics, there were small but  notable differences. It is not evident if these differences may lead to  differences in clinical pain effects when focused ultrasound is applied in vivo  or if focused ultrasound pressures that result in clinically relevant changes  damage nerve structures. Given the potential advantages of a non-invasive  technique for managing pain conditions, further investigation may be warranted in  an in vivo pain model.","2022-04","2024-03-06 17:03:45","2024-03-06T17:03:45Z","","242-248","","4","47","","Reg Anesth Pain Med","","","","","","","","eng","© American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine 2022.

However, the large mismatch of acoustic  properties between the skull and water can disrupt and shift the acoustic focus  in the brain. In this paper, we present a numerical method to find the optimal  location of a single-element FUS transducer, which creates focus on the target  region. METHODS: The score function, representing the superposition of acoustic  waves according to the relative phase difference and transmissibility, was  defined based on time-reversal invariance of acoustic waves and depending on the  spatial location of the transducer. The optimal location of the transducer was  then determined using a differential evolution algorithm. To assess the proposed  method, we conducted a forward simulation and compared the resulting focal  location to the desired target point. We also performed experimental validation  by measuring the acoustic pressure field through an ex vivo human skull in a  water tank. RESULTS: The numerical results indicated that the score function had  a positive proportional relationship with the acoustic pressure at the target.  Moreover, for the optimized transducer location, both the numerical and  experimental results showed that the normalized acoustic pressure at the target  was higher than 0.9. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed an optimization  method to place a single-element transducer that effectively transmits acoustic  energy to the targeted region in the brain. Our numerical and experimental  results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide an optimal transducer  location for safe and efficient FUS treatment.","2022-06","2024-03-06 17:03:41","2024-03-06T17:03:41Z","","106777","","","219","","Comput Methods Programs Biomed","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

Numerical modeling is commonly used for ultrasound probe development  and optimization of HIFU treatment strategies. This study was aimed at describing  a numerical method to simulate HIFU thermal ablation in elastic and mobile heart  models. The ultrasound pressure field is computed on a 3-D orthonormal grid using  the Rayleigh integral method, and the attenuation is calculated step by step  between cells. The temperature distribution is obtained by resolution of the  bioheat transfer equation on a 3-D non-orthogonally structured curvilinear grid  using the finite-volume method. The simulation method is applied on two regions  of the heart (atrioventricular node and ventricular apex) to compare the thermal  effects of HIFU ablation depending on deformation, motion type and amplitude. The  atrioventricular node requires longer sonication than the ventricular apex to  reach the same lesion volume. Motion considerably influences treatment duration,  lesion shape and distribution in cardiac HIFU treatment. These results emphasize  the importance of considering local motion and deformation in numerical studies  to define efficient and accurate treatment strategies.","2022-07","2024-03-06 17:03:35","2024-03-06T17:03:35Z","","1215-1228","","7","48","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Focal therapy is a  diagnosis-based investigational treatment option for localized PC that cures  clinically significant PC (csPC) while preserving the anatomical structures  related to urinary and sexual function based on its spread observed using  multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). The European Association of  Urology indicated that the current status of focal therapy for localized PC was  an investigational modality and encouraged prospective recording of outcomes and  recruitment of suitable patients in 2018. During the last few years,  large-population multi- and single-center prospective studies have investigated  focal therapy as a treatment strategy for localized PC. In a multicenter  prospective study with 5-year follow-up, failure-free survival, which was defined  as avoidance of local salvage therapy (surgery or radiotherapy), systemic  therapy, metastases, and prostate cancer-specific death, was 88%. In the previous  studies, there was no significant influence on urinary function before and at  3 months after the treatment, although transient impairment was reported 1 month  after the treatment. Pad- and leak-free continence was preserved in 80-100% of  the patients after treatment. Erectile function was significantly impaired in the  initial 3 months after treatment compared to the pretreatment values, but it  improved 6 months after the focal therapy in the previous reports. Paired  comparison studies and cohort studies with long-term follow-up will contribute to  verifying this treatment's clinical outcomes for patients with localized PC.","2022-01-15","2024-03-06 17:03:33","2024-03-06T17:03:33Z","","","","","","","J Med Ultrason (2001)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

We developed a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation device  to treat patients with IT hypertrophy. METHODS: First, computed tomography (CT)  images of patients without any evidence of sinonasal disease were evaluated to  measure and compared the IT, medial mucosal thickness (MT), and space between the  nasal septum and IT according to clinical characteristics such as septal deviation.  A HIFU prototype was developed based on human anatomical studies. The experimental  study was performed in five pigs; the cross-sectional areas of the nasal cavity  airway and histological changes at 1 and 4 weeks postoperatively were evaluated to  compare the efficacy of HIFU turbinoplasty with that of radiofrequency turbinoplasty  and control. RESULTS: The mean medial MT of the anterior, middle, and posterior  portions of the IT were 4.66±1.14, 4.23±0.97, and 6.17±1.29 mm, respectively. The  mean medial IT spaces was 2.65±0.79 mm. The diameter and focal depth of the  prototype were 4 mm and 3 mm. HIFU showed no postoperative complications including  bleeding or scar formation. After HIFU treatment, the cross-sectional area of the  nasal airway increased by 196.62(7.8%) mm3 and 193.74(8.3%) mm3 at 1 week and 4  weeks, compared with the increase of 87.20(3.1%) mm3 and 213.81(9.0%) mm3,  respectively, after radiofrequency therapy. Qualitative histologic analysis after  radiofrequency turbinoplasty showed epithelial layer disruption at 1 week and  increased fibrosis along with decreased glandular structure at 4 weeks. The HIFU  group had an intact epithelial layer at 1 week postoperatively. However, significant  differences were observed at 4 weeks, including increased fibrosis, and decreased  glandular structure. CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety of HIFU turbinoplasty had  been observed in an animal study.

Amyloid-β (Aβ)  aggregation, vascular damage and altered immune response interact at the  blood-brain barrier (BBB), affecting the brain endothelium and fuelling  neurodegeneration. The aim of the present systematic literature review was to  critically appraise and to summarise the published evidence on the clinical  correlations and pathophysiological concepts of BBB damage in AD, focusing on  human data. The PubMed, Cochrane, Medline and Embase databases were searched for  original research articles, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in  English language from 01/2000 to 07/2021, using the keywords Alzheimer*,  amyloid-β or β-amyloid or abeta and BBB. This review shows that specific changes  of intercellular structures, reduced expression of transendothelial carriers,  induction of vasoactive mediators and activation of both astroglia and  monocytes/macrophages characterise BBB damage in human AD and AD models. BBB  dysfunction on magnetic resonance imaging takes place early in the disease course  in AD-specific brain regions. The toxic effects of Aβ and apolipoprotein E (ApoE)  are likely to induce a non-cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy-related degeneration of  endothelial cells, independently of cerebrovascular disease; however, some of the  observed structural changes may just arise with age. Small vessel disease, ApoE,  loss of pericytes, proinflammatory signalling and cerebral amyloid angiopathy  enhance BBB damage. Novel therapeutic approaches for AD, including magnetic  resonance-guided focused ultrasound, aim to open the BBB, potentially leading to  an improved drainage of Aβ along perivascular channels and increased elimination  from the brain. In vitro treatments with ApoE-modifying agents yielded promising  effects on modulating BBB function. Reducing cardiovascular risk factors  represents one of the most promising interventions for dementia prevention at  present. However, further research is needed to elucidate the connection of BBB  damage and tau pathology, the role of proinflammatory mediators in draining  macromolecules and cells from the cerebral parenchyma, including their  contribution to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Improved insight into these  pathomechanisms may allow to shed light on the role of Aβ deposition as a primary  versus a secondary event in the complex pathogenesis of AD.","2022-04","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","e12782","","3","48","","Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.

This problem persists within the United States as well, as the  American Cancer Society has reported that ∼12.5% of women will be diagnosed with  invasive breast cancer over the course of their lifetime. Therefore, a clinical  need continues to exist to address this disease from a treatment and therapeutic  perspective. Current treatments for breast cancer and cancers more broadly  include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Adjuncts to these methods have been  developed to improve the clinical outcomes for patients. One such adjunctive  treatment is mild hyperthermia therapy (MHTh), which has been shown to be  successful in the treatment of cancers by increasing effectiveness and reduced  dosage requirements for radiation and chemotherapies. MHTh-assisted treatments  can be performed with invasive thermal devices, noninvasive microwave induction,  heating and recirculation of extracted patient blood, or whole-body hyperthermia  with hot blankets. PURPOSE: One common method for inducing MHTh is by using  microwave for heat induction and magnetic resonance imaging for temperature  monitoring. However, this leads to a complex, expensive, and inaccessible therapy  platform. Therefore, in this work we aim to show the feasibility of a novel  all-acoustic MHTh system that uses focused ultrasound (US) to induce heating  while also using US tomography (UST) to provide temperature estimates. Changes in  sound speed (SS) have been shown to be strongly correlated with temperature  changes and can therefore be used to indirectly monitor heating throughout the  therapy. Additionally, these SS estimates allow for heterogeneous SS-corrected  phase delays when heating complex and heterogeneous tissue structures. METHODS:  Feasibility to induce localized heat in tissue was investigated in silico with a  simulated breast model, including an embedded tumor using continuous wave US.  Here, both heterogenous acoustic and thermal properties were modeled in addition  to blood perfusion. We further demonstrate, with ex vivo tissue phantoms, the  feasibility of using ring-based UST to monitor temperature by tracking changes in  SS. Two phantoms (lamb tissue and human abdominal fat) with latex tubes  containing varied temperature flowing water were imaged. The measured SS of the  water at each temperature were compared against values that are reported in  literature. RESULTS: Results from ex vivo tissue studies indicate successful  tracking of temperature under various phantom configurations and ranges of water  temperature. The results of in silico studies show that the proposed system can  heat an acoustically and thermally heterogenous breast model to the clinically  relevant temperature of 42°C while accounting for a reasonable time needed to  image the current cross section (200 ms). Further, we have performed an initial  in silico study demonstrating the feasibility of adjusting the transmit waveform  frequency to modify the effective heating height at the focused region. Lastly,  we have shown in a simpler 2D breast model that MHTh level temperatures can be  maintained by adjusting the transmit pressure intensity of the US ring.  CONCLUSIONS: This work has demonstrated the feasibility of using a 256-element  ring array transducer for temperature monitoring; however, future work will  investigate minimizing the difference between measured SS and the values shown in  literature. A hypothesis attributes this bias to potential volumetric average  artifacts from the ray-based SS inversion algorithm that was used, and that  moving to a waveform-based SS inversion algorithm will greatly improve the SS  estimates. Additionally, we have shown that an all-acoustic MHTh system is  feasible via in silico studies. These studies have indicated that the proposed  system can heat a tumor within a heterogenous breast model to 42°C within a  narrow time frame. This holds great promise for increasing the accessibility and  reducing the complexity of a future all-acoustic MHTh system.","2022-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","6120-6136","","9","49","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35759729","","","","*Breast Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/therapy; *Hyperthermia, Induced/methods; Animals; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Phantoms, Imaging; Sheep; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Transducers; Water; ex vivo; in silico; mild hyperthermia; ring transducer; sound speed; thermometry; tomography; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While outcomes of this device in postprostatectomy incontinence (PPI)  are widely described, those obtained for incontinence after benign prostatic  obstruction (BPO) surgery remains poorly explored. OBJECTIVE: To compare  continence outcomes after AUS implantation in a PPI population with those  obtained in men incontinent after BPO surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:  A retrospective review of all cases of AUS implantation between 2005 and 2020 in  16 different French centers was conducted. Only patients with primary  implantation whose indication was moderate to severe SUI after prostatectomy or  BPO surgery were included (excluding those with a history of radiation therapy,  brachytherapy, cystectomy, high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy, or  neurogenic disease). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary  endpoint was the rate of social continence (zero or one pad per day) at 3 mo.  Complications were also noted within 90 d of implantation. RESULTS AND  LIMITATIONS: A total of 417 patients were included in the PPI group and 50 in the  BPO surgery group. Social continence rates at 3 mo were similar between the  groups (79% vs 72%, p = 0.701). Complication rate was significantly higher in the  BPO group (8% vs 18%, p = 0.044). The same was found for the Clavien-Dindo type 2  complication rate (20.6% vs 44.4%, p = 0.026). The retrospective nature and lack  of precise definition of incontinence are the main limitations of this study.  CONCLUSIONS: This multicentric study strengthens the position of AUS as gold  standard for SUI after radical prostatectomy. Comparable efficacy results were  found for incontinence after BPO surgery, with nevertheless a higher rate of  complications. PATIENT SUMMARY: Artificial urinary sphincter represents the gold  standard for the treatment of moderate to severe stress urinary incontinence.  Efficacy results are comparable between postprostatectomy incontinence and  incontinence after benign prostatic obstruction surgery.","2022-07","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1053-1059","","4","8","","Eur Urol Focus","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 European Association of Urology.

While this ""blood-brain barrier"" (BBB) function  protects the fragile environment in the brain, it also poses a tremendous  challenge for the delivery of drug compounds to the brain parenchyma.  Paracellular brain uptake of drug compounds is limited by the physical tightness  of the endothelium, which is tightly sealed with junction complexes.  Transcellular uptake of lipophilic drug compounds is limited by the activity of  active efflux pumps in the luminal membrane. As a result, the majority of  registered CNS drug compounds are small lipophilic compounds which are not efflux  transporter substrates. Small molecule CNS drug development therefore focuses on  identifying compounds with CNS target affinity and modifies these in order to  optimize lipophilicity and decrease efflux pump interactions. Since efflux pump  activity is limiting drug uptake, it has been investigated whether  coadministration of drug compounds with efflux pump inhibitors could increase  drug uptake. While the concept works to some extent, a lot of challenges have  been encountered in terms of obtaining efficient inhibition while avoiding  adverse effects.Some CNS drug compounds enter the brain via nutrient transport  proteins, an example is the levodopa, a prodrug of Dopamine, which crosses the  BBB via the large neutral amino acid transporter LAT1. While carrier-mediated  transport of drug compounds may seem attractive, the development of drugs  targeting transporters is very challenging, since the compounds should have a  good fit to the binding site, while still maintaining their CNS target  affinity.Receptor-mediated transport of drug compounds, especially  biotherapeutics, conjugated to a receptor-binding ligand has shown some promise,  although the amounts transported are rather low. This also holds true for  drug-conjugation to cell-penetrating peptides. Due to the low uptake of  biotherapeutics, barrier-breaching approaches such as mannitol injections and  focused ultrasound have been employed with some success to patient groups with no  other treatment options.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","151-183","","","273","","Handb Exp Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020.

Non-persistent embolism due to non-compacted thrombus and activated  fibrinolytic system within the tumor large blood vessels and tumor margin  recurrence are the main therapeutic bottlenecks. Herein, an erythrocyte  membrane-coated invisible acoustic-sensitive nanoparticle (TXA+DOX/PFH/RBCM@cRGD)  is described, which can induce tumor thrombus infarction by precisely damaging  tumor vascular endothelium. It is revealed that TXA+DOX/PFH/RBCM@cRGD can  effectively accumulate on the endothelial surface of tumor vessels with the help  of the red blood cell membrane (RBCM) stealth coating and RGD cyclic peptide  (cRGD), which can be delivered in a targeted manner as nanoparticle missiles.  As a kind of phase-change material, perfluorohexane (PFH) nanodroplets possess  excellent acoustic responsiveness. Acoustic-sensitive missiles can undergo an  acoustic phase transition and intense cavitation with response to low-intensity  focused ultrasound (LIFU), damaging the tumor vascular endothelium, rapidly  initiating the coagulation cascade, and forming thromboembolism in the tumor  vessels. The drugs loaded in the inner water phase are released explosively.  Tranexamic acid (TXA) inhibits the fibrinolytic system, and doxorubicin (DOX)  eliminates the margin survival. In summary, a stealthy and acoustically  responsive multifunctional nanoparticle delivery platform is successfully  developed for inducing thrombus infarction by precisely damaging tumor vascular  endothelium.","2022-07","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","e2201933","","30","18","","Small","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 35789094","","","","*Nanoparticles/therapeutic use; *Neoplasms/drug therapy; Acoustics; Cell Line, Tumor; Doxorubicin/pharmacology; Endothelium, Vascular; Erythrocyte Membrane; Humans; Infarction/drug therapy; acoustic-sensitive nanoparticles; erythrocyte membrane coating; tumor thrombotic infarction; tumor vascular occlusion; vascular endothelial injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A promising approach for non-invasive gene  delivery to the brain is to administer recombinant adeno-associated viruses  (AAVs) intravenously and allow them to cross the BBB at precise FUS-targeted  brain regions. FUS-AAV delivery has been achieved in animal models; however, the  key elements influencing, guiding, and monitoring the success of FUS-AAV delivery  to the brain remain largely unknown. We systematically compared the ability of  AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, AAV8, AAV9, and AAVrg to enter four specific brain regions and  transduce two main cell types: neurons and astrocytes. Our results demonstrate  that the AAV serotype, the extent of FUS-induced BBB permeability, and the  intrinsic properties of the targeted brain tissue influence the observed  biodistribution, diffusion and transduction of AAV to cells of the  cerebrovasculature and brain parenchyma. Non-invasive contrast-enhanced MR  imaging was found to predict the efficacy of FUS-AAV delivery. Notably, we also  found that AAVs with high biodistribution to peripheral organs result in low gene  delivery to the brain when combined with FUS. Gene delivery by AAV1, AAV2, AAV5,  AAV8 and AAV9 was highly and selectively localized to FUS-targeted brain areas.  To obtain non-invasive gene delivery to multiple brain regions with one area of  FUS-BBB modulation, we combined a modified AAV2 vector harboring enhanced  retrograde transport properties (AAVrg) with FUS-mediated brain delivery. This  allowed for gene delivery from the FUS-targeted site to multiple connected brain  regions. This study demonstrates that MR imaging can be used as a non-invasive  indication of AAV delivery to the brain, and that the properties of AAV serotypes  influence the efficacy of gene delivery to the brain with FUS. AAVs that have  minimal peripheral biodistribution are ideal candidates for enhanced, and perhaps  exclusive with future serotypes, delivery to the brain with FUS. The  characterization of parameters influencing FUS-AAV delivery to the brain are  critical to the design of safe and efficient gene therapies, from preclinical  studies to future clinical applications.","2022-11","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","667-680","","","351","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Unfortunately, the lack of selectivity, insufficient tumor  accumulation, uneven tumor distribution and severe systemic toxicity lead to the  unsatisfactory performance of these drugs. While a more precise drug delivery,  on-demand drug release, and deep diffusion of drugs (homogeneous distribution of  drugs in the tumor) could improve the application, they remain challenging.  Chemotherapeutic drug-loaded acoustic nanodroplet with dual-imaging capacity is  expected to solve these problems. METHODS: Folate (Fa)-modified and doxorubicin  (Dox)-loaded acoustic poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), low intensity  focused ultrasound (LIFU)-responsive perfluoropentane (PFP) and Fe(3)O(4)  nanoparticles (designated as Fa-Fe@P-PFP-Dox) were integrated by a  double-emulsion method. After the synthesis, the LIFU-triggered acoustic droplet  vaporization (ADV) effect, LIFU-triggered drug release, cell targeting  capability, in vitro cell-killing effects, biodistribution, PA/MR dual imaging  (PA: photoacoustic; MR: magnetic resonance), LIFU-augmented Dox distribution in  tumors and chemotherapeutic efficacy of Fa-Fe@P-PFP-Dox were investigated.  RESULTS: The distribution of these drug-loaded nanodroplets was clearly monitored  via PA/MR dual imaging. Upon LIFU irradiation, PFP within the Fa-Fe@P-PFP-Dox  nanodroplets underwent ADV, which led to the release of Dox and promoted the deep  penetration of Dox in tumor tissue, eventually achieving highly efficient  chemotherapy against NPC. As a result, LIFU-triggered chemotherapy exerted a  highly efficient therapeutic effect with a tumor inhibition rate of 74.24 ±  7.95%. CONCLUSION: Fa-modified and drug-loaded acoustic nanodroplets have been  successfully constructed for dual-imaging guided highly efficient chemotherapy  against NPC. This novel tumor drug delivery method is expected to provide an  efficient, visualized, and precise personalized treatment method for NPC patients  with minimal side effects.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","4879-4894","","","17","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Yang et al.","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 36262190  PMCID: PMC9576276","","","","*Nanoparticles; *Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy; Acoustics; Cell Line, Tumor; Doxorubicin/pharmacology; Drug Delivery Systems; Emulsions; Folic Acid; Humans; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma/drug therapy; Tissue Distribution; chemotherapy; deep penetration; drug delivery; low intensity focused ultrasound; nasopharyngeal carcinoma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this is not true for all cases, even for successful ablation. How  the brain differs in patients with ET between those with long-term good and poor  outcomes is not clear. To analyze the functional connectivity difference between  patients in whom thalamotomy was effective and those in whom thalamotomy was  ineffective and its prognostic role in ET treatment, the authors evaluated  preoperative resting-state functional MRI in thalamotomy-treated patients.  METHODS: Preoperative resting-state functional MRI data in 85 patients with ET,  who were experiencing tremor relief at the time of treatment and were followed up  for a minimum of 6 months after the procedure, were collected for the study. The  authors conducted a graph independent component analysis of the functional  connectivity matrices of tremor-related networks. The patients were divided into  thalamotomy-effective and thalamotomy-ineffective groups (thalamotomy-effective  group, ≥ 50% motor symptom reduction; thalamotomy-ineffective group, < 50% motor  symptom reduction at 6 months after treatment) and the authors compared network  components between groups. RESULTS: Seventy-two (84.7%) of the 85 patients showed  ≥ 50% tremor reduction from baseline at 6 months after thalamotomy. The network  analysis shows significant suppression of functional network components with  connections between the areas of the cerebellum and the basal ganglia and  thalamus, but enhancement of those between the premotor cortex and supplementary  motor area in the noneffective group compared to the effective group.  CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that patients in the noneffective  group have suppressed functional subnetworks in the cerebellum and subcortex  regions and have enhanced functional subnetworks among motor-sensory cortical  networks compared to the thalamotomy-effective group. Therefore, the authors  suggest that the functional connectivity pattern might be a possible predictive  factor for outcomes of MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy.","2023-02-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","318-328","","2","138","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35901685","","","","*Essential Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Thalamus/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Treatment Outcome; Tremor; Ventral Thalamic Nuclei; brain network; essential tremor; functional neurosurgery; graph independent component analysis; prognosis; thalamotomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a lower dose of Adu  (3 mg/kg) with enhanced delivery via focused ultrasound (FUS) in an AD mouse  model. METHODS: The FUS with microbubbles opened the blood-brain barrier (BBB) of  the hippocampus for the delivery of Adu. The combined therapy of FUS and Adu was  performed three times in total and each treatment was performed biweekly. Y-maze  test, Brdu labeling, and immunohistochemical experimental methods were employed  in this study. In addition, RNA sequencing and ingenuity pathway analysis were  employed to investigate gene expression profiles in the hippocampi of  experimental animals. RESULTS: The FUS-mediated BBB opening markedly increased  the delivery of Adu into the brain by approximately 8.1 times in the brains. The  combined treatment induced significantly less cognitive decline and decreased the  level of amyloid plaques in the hippocampi of the 5×FAD mice compared with Adu or  FUS alone. Combined treatment with FUS and Adu activated phagocytic microglia and  increased the number of astrocytes associated with amyloid plaques in the  hippocampi of 5×FAD mice. Furthermore, RNA sequencing identified that 4 enriched  canonical pathways including phagosome formation, neuroinflammation signaling,  CREB signaling and reelin signaling were altered in the hippocami of 5×FAD mice  receiving the combined treatment. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the enhanced  delivery of a low dose of Adu (3 mg/kg) via FUS decreases amyloid deposits and  attenuates cognitive function deficits. FUS-mediated BBB opening increases adult  hippocampal neurogenesis as well as drug delivery. We present an AD treatment  strategy through the synergistic effect of the combined therapy of FUS and Adu.","2022-12-27","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","57","","1","11","","Transl Neurodegener","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Brain stimulation of awake sheep, in  the absence of the confounding effects of anesthesia on brain function, provides  translational insight into potential human applications with safety information  supplemented by histological analyses. We examined the effects of tFUS pulsing  parameters, particularly regarding pulse durations (PDs), on stimulating the  cortical motor area (M1) and its thalamic projection in unanesthetized, awake  sheep (n = 8). A wearable tFUS headgear, custom-made for individual sheep,  enabled experiments to be conducted without using anesthesia. FUS stimuli, each  200 ms long, were delivered to the M1 and the thalamus using three different PDs  (0.5, 1, and 2 ms) with the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) adjusted to maintain  a 70% duty cycle at a derated in situ spatial-peak temporal-average intensity  (Ispta) of 3.6 W/cm2. Efferent electromyography (EMG) responses to stimulation  were quantified from both hind limbs. Group-averaged EMG responses from each of  the hind limbs across the experimental conditions revealed selective responses  from the hind limb contralateral to sonication. The use of 0.5 and 1 ms PDs  generated higher EMG signal amplitudes compared to those obtained using a 2 ms  PD. Faster efferent response was also observed from thalamic stimulation than  that from stimulating the M1. Post-sonication behavioral observation and  histological assessment performed 24 h and 1 month after sonication were not  indicative of any abnormalities. The results suggest the presence of pulsing  scheme-dependent effects of tFUS on brain stimulation and attest its safety in  awake large animals.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","e0278865","","12","17","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright: © 2022 Kim et al.

The standard method for gene delivery in  the brain involves invasive craniotomies that expose the brain and direct  injections of viruses that invariably damage neural tissue along the syringe  tract. A recently proposed alternative in which non-invasive optogenetics is  performed with focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB)  openings has been found to non-invasively facilitate gene delivery for  optogenetics in mice. Although gene delivery can be performed non-invasively,  validating successful viral transduction and expression of encoded ion channels  in target tissue typically involves similar invasive techniques, such as  craniotomies in longitudinal studies and/or postmortem histology. Functional  ultrasound imaging (fUSi) is an emerging neuroimaging technique that can be used  to transcranially detect changes in cerebral blood volume following introduction  of a stimulus. In this study, we implemented a fully non-invasive combined  FUS-fUSi technique for performing optogenetics in mice. FUS successfully  delivered viruses encoding the red-shifted channelrhodopsin variant ChrimsonR in  all treated subjects. fUSi successfully identified stimulus-evoked cerebral blood  volume changes preferentially in brain regions expressing the light-sensitive ion  channels. Improvements in cell-specific targeting of viral vectors and  transcranial ultrasound imaging will make the combined technique a useful tool  for neuroscience research in small animals.","2023-03","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","908-917","","3","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

The rapidly  evolving field of immuno-engineering provides new opportunities to dismantle the  tumor immune microenvironment by efficient tumor destruction. Systemic delivery  of such treatments can often have limited local effects, leading to unwanted  offsite effects such as systemic toxicity and tumor resistance. Interventional  radiologists use contemporary image-guided techniques to locally deliver these  therapies to modulate the immunosuppressive TME, further accelerating tumor death  and invoking a better anti-tumor response. These involve local therapies such as  intratumoral drug delivery, nanorobots, nanoparticles, and implantable  microdevices. Physical therapies such as photodynamic therapy, electroporation,  hyperthermia, hypothermia, ultrasound therapy, histotripsy, and radiotherapy are  also available for local tumor destruction. While the interventional radiologist  can only locally manipulate the TME, there are systemic offsite recruitments of  the immune response. This is known as the abscopal effect, which leads to more  significant anti-tumoral downstream effects. Local delivery of modern  immunoengineering methods such as locoregional CAR-T therapy combined with immune  checkpoint inhibitors efficaciously modulates the immunosuppressive TME. This  review highlights the various advances and technologies available now to change  the TME and revolutionize oncology from a minimally invasive viewpoint.","2022-12-29","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","1","15","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36612192  PMCID: PMC9818918","","","","CAR-T cell therapy; immunoengineering; immunomodulation; interventional oncology; interventional radiology; locoregional therapy; tumor microenvironment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Convective bulk flow of solutes in the  CSF in the perivascular space (PVS) is considered one of the important mechanisms  behind solute movement in the brain, before their ultimate drainage to the  systemic lymphatic system. Acoustic pressure waves can impose radiation force on  a medium in its path, inducing localized and directional fluidic flow, known as  acoustic streaming. We transcranially applied low-intensity focused ultrasound  (FUS) to rats that received an intracisternal injection of fluorescent CSF  tracers (dextran and ovalbumin, having two different molecular weights-M(w)). The  sonication pulsing parameter was determined on the set that propelled the aqueous  solution of toluidine blue O dye into a porous media (melamine foam) at the  highest level of infiltration. Fluorescence imaging of the brain showed that  application of FUS increased the uptake of ovalbumin at the sonicated plane,  particularly around the ventricles, whereas the uptake of high-M(w) dextran was  unaffected. Numerical simulation showed that the effects of sonication were  non-thermal. Sonication did not alter the animals' behavior or disrupt the  blood-brain barrier (BBB) while yielding normal brain histology. The results  suggest that FUS may serve as a new non-invasive means to promote interstitial  CSF solute transport in a region-specific manner without disrupting the BBB,  providing potential for enhanced clearance of waste products from the brain.","2022-07-28","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","12940","","1","12","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

In the work described  here, we studied g(US) properties further by comparing FUS-evoked depolarization  (FUSD) in control and hypotonic saline with 75% of control osmolarity. The FUS  was a train of 20 FUS bursts (2.1 MHz and 50 µs per burst) delivered at 1 kHz.  The amplitude, onset latency, frequency of occurrence and duration of FUSD were  compared in a 15-min time window before and after switching to hypotonic saline.  Significant increases were observed for amplitude (p < 0.001) and frequency of  occurrence (p < 0.01) while the onset latency exhibited a significant decrease (p  < 0.001). FUSD duration did not significantly differ. These results support  predictions based on our hypothesis that g(US) is mediated by opening of  nanopores in the lipid bilayer and that stretching of axonal membrane caused by  swelling at low osmolarity should increase the probability of nanopore formation  under FUS. The FUSD parameters, in addition, exhibited time-dependent trends when  the window of observation was expanded to 45 min in each saline. The statistical  significance of amplitude and duration differed between 15- and 45-min time  windows, indicating the presence of adaptive responses of axonal membrane to  osmotic manipulation.","2022-10","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2040-2051","","10","48","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

The  objective of this study was to develop and test a deep learning-based method for  translation of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) into synthetic CE-T1w scans, for  monitoring MR-HIFU treatment progression. METHODS: The algorithm was  retrospectively trained and validated on data from 33 and 20 patients  respectively who underwent an MR-HIFU treatment of uterine fibroids between June  2017 and January 2019. Postablation synthetic CE-T1w images were generated by a  deep learning network trained on paired DWI and reference CE-T1w scans acquired  during the treatment procedure. Quantitative analysis included calculation of the  Dice coefficient of NPVs delineated on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans. Four  MR-HIFU radiologists assessed the outcome of MR-HIFU treatments and NPV ratio  based on the synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans. RESULTS: Dice coefficient of  NPVs was 71% (± 22%). The mean difference in NPV ratio was 1.4% (± 22%) and not  statistically significant (p = 0.79). Absolute agreement of the radiologists on  technical treatment success on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans was 83%. NPV  ratio estimations on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans were not significantly  different (p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning-based synthetic CE-T1w scans  derived from intraprocedural DWI allow gadolinium-free visualization of the  predicted NPV, and can potentially be used for repeated gadolinium-free  monitoring of treatment progression during MR-HIFU therapy for uterine fibroids.  KEY POINTS: • Synthetic CE-T1w scans can be derived from diffusion-weighted  imaging using deep learning. • Synthetic CE-T1w scans may be used for  visualization of the NPV without using a contrast agent directly after MR-HIFU  ablations of uterine fibroids.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","4178-4188","","6","33","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Soft tissue phase aberration may be particularly severe for histotripsy due to large aperture and lowf-number transducer geometries. This  study investigated how phase aberration from human abdominal tissue affects  focusing of a large, strongly curved histotripsy transducer.Approach.A  computational model (k-Wave) was experimentally validated withex vivoporcine  abdominal tissue and used to simulate focusing a histotripsy transducer (radius:  14.2 cm,f-number: 0.62, central frequencyf(c): 750 kHz) through the human  abdomen. Abdominal computed tomography images from 10 human subjects were  segmented to create three-dimensional acoustic property maps. Simulations were  performed focusing at 3 target locations in the liver of each subject with ideal  phase correction, without phase correction, and after separately matching the  sound speed of water and fat to non-fat soft tissue.Main results.Experimental  validation in porcine abdominal tissue showed that simulated and measured arrival  time differences agreed well (average error, ∼0.10 acoustic cycles atf(c)). In  simulations with human tissue, aberration created arrival time differences of  0.65μs (∼0.5 cycles) at the target and shifted the focus from the target by 6.8  mm (6.4 mm pre-focally along depth direction), on average. Ideal phase correction  increased maximum pressure amplitude by 95%, on average. Matching the sound speed  of water and fat to non-fat soft tissue decreased the average pre-focal shift by  3.6 and 0.5 mm and increased pressure amplitude by 2% and 69%,  respectively.Significance.Soft tissue phase aberration of large aperture,  lowf-number histotripsy transducers is substantial despite low therapeutic  frequencies. Phase correction could potentially recover substantial pressure  amplitude for transabdominal histotripsy. Additionally, different heterogeneity  sources distinctly affect focusing quality. The water path strongly affects the  focal shift, while irregular tissue boundaries (e.g. fat) dominate pressure loss.","2022-07-19","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","15","67","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35772383  PMCID: PMC9396534","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Transducers; Abdomen/diagnostic imaging; Animals; Humans; Liver; Phantoms, Imaging; Swine; Water; histotripsy; phase aberration; simulation; soft tissue; therapeutic ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome these long-standing obstacles, we proposed a  superhydrophobic coating on the surface of the ADS NPs that could be easily  modified via fluorination (ADSF NPs). The surface of fluorinated ADS NPs was  further modified with a phospholipid layer to reduce aggregation and improve  biocompatibility (ADSFL NPs). The contact angle and mean size of ADSFL NPs were  30.2 ± 4.4° and 353.1 ± 54.2 nm, respectively. The superhydrophobic layer  generated interfacial nanobubbles on the outer shell of the NPs that reduced  water-induced leakage of doxorubicin (DOX) sevenfold compared with the uncoated  group and induced a cavitation effect upon ultrasound (US) sonication. Moreover,  release of DOX from the ADSFL NPs could be triggered by US, and this release was  further improved 1.6-fold in acidic aqueous conditions, indicating that the ADSFL  NPs retained pH responsiveness. Enhanced sonography contrast and histological  examination demonstrated that US could trigger cavitation activities from ADSFL  NPs in vivo to induce vessel disruption and enhance the fluorescence intensity of  DOX within the tumor region threefold under US imaging guidance compared with the  ADSFL NPs-only group.","2022-11-07","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","3894-3905","","11","19","","Mol Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36018041","","","","*Nanoparticles/chemistry; *Neoplasms/drug therapy; Calcium Carbonate; Cell Line, Tumor; Doxorubicin/chemistry; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Silicon Dioxide; cavitation; focused ultrasound; interfacial nanobubbles; silica nanoparticle; solid tumor; ultrasound contrast agent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early evidence suggests that MR-HIFU is associated with similar  overall treatment response, but more rapid pain palliation compared to external  beam radiotherapy (EBRT). This modelling study aimed to assess the  cost-effectiveness of MR-HIFU as an alternative treatment option for painful bone  metastases from the perspective of the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI).  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A microsimulation model with lifelong time horizon and  one-month cycle length was developed. To calculate the incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), strategy A (MR-HIFU as first-line treatment or  as retreatment option in case of persistent pain or only partial pain relief  after EBRT) was compared to strategy B (EBRT alone) for patients with bone  metastases due to breast, prostate, or lung cancer. Input parameters used for the  model were extracted from the literature. Results were expressed as EUR per  quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and EUR per pain response (i.e., months spent  with complete or partial pain response). Deterministic and probabilistic  sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to test the robustness of results, and  a value of information analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Compared to strategy B,  strategy A resulted in additional costs (EUR 399) and benefits (0.02 QALYs and  0.95 months with pain response). In the base case, the resulting ICERs (strategy  A vs. strategy B) are EUR 19,845/QALY and EUR 421 per pain response. Offering all  patients MR-HIFU as first-line treatment would increase the ICER by 50% (31,048  EUR/QALY). PSA showed that at a (hypothetical) willingness to pay of EUR  20,000/QALY, the probability of MR-HIFU being cost-effective was 52%. The  expected value of perfect information (EVPI) for the benefit population in  Germany is approximately EUR 190 Mio. CONCLUSION: Although there is considerable  uncertainty, the results demonstrate that introducing MR-HIFU as a treatment  alternative for painful bone metastases might be cost-effective for the German  SHI. The high EVPI indicate that further studies to reduce uncertainty would be  worthwhile.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","987546","","","12","","Front Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Simões Corrêa Galendi, Yeo, Grüll, Bratke, Akuamoa-Boateng, Baues, Bos, Verkooijen, Shukri, Stock and Müller.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36212449  PMCID: PMC9537476","","","","MR-HIFU; bone metastases; cancer pain; cost-effectiveness; high-intensity focused ultrasound; pain palliation; radiotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Stimulation (tFUS) seems  to be a valid non-invasive technique for restoring sensory feedback allowing to  deliver acoustic energy to cortical sensory areas with high spatial resolution  and depth penetration. This paper aims at studying in simulation the use of tFUS  on cortical sensory areas to evaluate its effects in terms of latency ad firing  rate of the cells response, for understanding if these parameters influence the  safety and the efficacy of the stimulation. In this paper, in order to study the  propagation of the ultrasound wave from the transducer to the cortical cells, a  multiscale approach was implemented by building a macroscopic model, which  estimates the pressure profile in a simplified 2D human head geometry, and  coupling it with the SONIC microscale model, that describes the electrical  behaviour of a cortical neuron. The influence of the stimulation parameters and  of the skull thickness on the latency and the firing rate are evaluated and the  obtained behaviour is linked to the sensory response obtained on human subjects.  Results have shown that slight changes in the transducer position should not  affect the efficacy of the stimulation; however, high skull thickness leads to  lower cells activation. These results will be useful for evaluating safety and  effectiveness of tFUS for sensory feedback in closed-loop prosthetic systems.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1034194","","","10","","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Scarpelli, Stefano, Cordella and Zollo.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36532581  PMCID: PMC9751020","","","","computational modeling; multiscale simulation; prosthetic systems; sensory feedback; transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

FDA-approved βCD and its modified versions such as low-degree methylated βCD have  been previously demonstrated as prime examples of structures capable of  accommodating PFC molecules. However, the complex formation potential of  different CDs with various cavity sizes in the presence of PFC molecules, and  their consequent aggregation, needs to be explored. In the present study, the  complexation and aggregation potential of some natural CDs and their respective  derivatives either exposed to perfluoropentane (PFP) or perfluorohexane (PFH)  were studied in the wet lab. Computational studies were also performed to account  for the limitations faced in PFC quantification because of the low optical  density of PFCs within the CD complex and to discover the best candidate for NMH  applications. All results revealed that only βCD and γCD (except HMγCD)  derivatives form an inclusion complex with PFCs and only LMβCD, βCD, and γCD form  nanocone clusters (NCCs), which precipitate and can be collected for use.  Furthermore, the data collectively show that βCD and PFCs have the best  complexation due to stable complex formation, ease of production, and product  recovery, especially with PFH as a more suitable candidate due to its high  boiling point, which allows workability during synthesis. Although simulations  suggest that highly stable inclusion complexes exist, such as HPβCD, the cluster  formation resulting in precipitation is hindered due to the high solubility of  CDs in water, resulting in intangible yields to work with even after employing  general laboratory recovery methods. Conclusively, histotripsy cavitation  experiments successfully showed a decreased cavitation threshold among optimal  NCC candidates that were identified, supporting their use in NMH.","2022-08-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2907-2921","","8","19","","Mol Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35839291","","","","*Cyclodextrins/chemistry; *Fluorocarbons/chemistry; 2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin; Cluster Analysis; Solubility; cyclodextrin; histotripsy; nanocones; nanoparticle-mediated histotripsy; perfluorocarbon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, HIFU was utilised for fat ablation using a single-element  ultrasonic transducer operating in thermal mode. METHODS: The custom-made concave  transducer that operates at 1.1 MHz was assessed on excised porcine adipose  tissue for its ability to reduce fat. Ultrasonic sonications were executed on the  adipose tissue utilising acoustical power between 14 and 75 W and sonication time  in the range of 1-10 min. The mass of the adipose tissue sample was weighed afore  and after ultrasonic sonications and the effect of the sonication on the mass  change was recorded. RESULTS: Mass change was linearly dependent with either  increasing acoustical power or sonication time and was in the range of  0.46-1.9 g. High acoustical power of 62.5 W for a sonication time of 1 min and a  power of 75 W for a sonication time of 5 min, respectively resulted in the  formation of a lesion or possible cavitation on the piece of excised adipose  tissue. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed  transducer in achieving a reduction of excised fat tissue. The present findings  indicate the potential use of the transducer in a HIFU system indicated for the  reduction of subcutaneous adipose tissue where increased values of acoustical  power can result in increased amounts of fat reduction.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","815-825","","4","25","","J Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Despite its superior sensitivity, its mediocre  spatial-resolution has been the main barrier to its clinical translation. This  limitation is mainly due to the high scattering of optical photons in biological  tissue together with the limited boundary measurements that lead to an  undetermined and ill-posed inverse problem. To overcome the limitations of FMT,  we previously introduced a novel method termed, Temperature Modulated  Fluorescence Tomography (TMFT). TMFT utilizes thermos-sensitive fluorescent  agents (ThermoDots) as a key component and localizes them with high-intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU). Scanning the focused HIFU beam having a diameter  Ø = 1.3 mm across the tissue while monitoring the variation in the measured  fluorescence signals reveals the position of the ThermoDots with high spatial  accuracy. We have formerly built a prototype TMFT system that uses optical fibers  for detection. In this paper, we present an upgraded version using a CCD  camera-based detection that enables non-contact imaging. In this version, the  animal under investigation is placed on an ultrasound transparent membrane, which  eliminates the need for its immersion in optical matching fluids that were  required by the fiber-based system. This CCD-based system will pave the way for  convenient and wide-spread use of TMFT in preclinical research. Its performance  validation on phantom studies demonstrates that high spatial-resolution (∼1.3 mm)  and quantitative accuracy in recovered fluorophore concentration (<3% error) can  be achieved.","2022-11-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","5740-5752","","11","13","","Biomed Opt Express","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36733748  PMCID: PMC9872903","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PWS is typically treated by using lasers to destroy  abnormal blood vessels. The laser heating facilitates selective photothermolysis  of the vessels and attenuates quickly in the tissue due to high optical  scattering. Therefore, residual abnormal capillaries deep in the tissue survive  and often lead to the resurgence of PWS. Ultrasound (US) has also been proposed  to treat PWS, however, it is nonselective with respect to the vasculature but  penetrates deeper into the tissue. We aim to study the feasibility of a hybrid  PWS treatment modality combining the advantages of both modalities. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: In this manuscript, we propose a photoacoustic (PA) guided US focusing  methodology for PWS treatment which combines the optical contrast-based  selectivity with US penetration to focus the US energy onto the vasculature. The  PA signals collected by the transducers, when time-reversed, amplified, and  transmitted, converge onto the PWS, thus minimally affecting the neighboring  tissue. We performed two- and three-dimensional simulations that mimic realistic  transducers and medium properties in this proof of concept study. RESULTS: The  time-reversed PA signals when transmitted from the transducers converged onto the  vasculature, as expected, thus reducing the heating of the neighboring tissue. We  observed that while the US focus is indeed affected due to experimental factors  such as limited-view, large detector separation and finite detection bandwidth,  and so forth, the US did focus completely or partially onto the vasculature  demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed methodology. CONCLUSION: The  results demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology for PWS treatment.  This treatment method can destroy the deeper capillaries while minimally heating  the neighboring tissue, thus reducing the chances of the resurgence of PWS and as  well as cosmetic scarring.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","46-60","","1","55","","Lasers Surg Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36208102  PMCID: PMC9892359","","","","*Port-Wine Stain/diagnostic imaging/therapy; Cicatrix; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Lasers; Spectrum Analysis; high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU); photoacoustic (PA)-guided ultrasound (US); photoacoustics (PA); port wine stain (PWS); time-reversal (TR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies have shown that  transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with high intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU) has significant efficacy, but there are relatively few  studies on TACE combined with HIFU in China. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect  of using HIFU combined with TACE on patients' liver function impairment and  immune function in pediatric HB patients and to analyze the effectiveness and  safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 110 unresectable pediatric HB  patients treated in our hospital from December 2019 to December 2021 were  selected as the subjects and divided into 2 groups. The comparison group was  treated with TACE, and the combination group was treated with HIFU on the basis  of the comparison group. The differences in immune function, survival, treatment  side effects and clinical efficacy between the 2 groups were observed. RESULTS:  In the combined group, the 1-year survival rate was 100%, the 3-year survival  rate was 84.0%, the 5-year survival rate was 16.0%; while in comparison group, it  was 82%, 16%, 0%, respectively. The ratio of CD4+/CD8+ in the combined group were  significantly higher than in the comparison group after treatment (P < .05).  Granulocytopenia, mucositis, thrombocytopenia, and cardiac and renal toxicity  were significantly lower in the combined group than in the comparison group, and  the effective rate of the combined group was 98.00% which was significantly  higher than that of the control group (76.00%) (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Comparative  study of HB in children treated with HIFU combined with TACE is more effective,  effectively improving the immune level of patients, significantly increasing the  remission rate, which can improve the tumor necrosis and improve the survival  quality of patients, and is a better choice for HB in children.","2022-12-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","e32022","","48","101","","Medicine (Baltimore)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

Agarose and polyacrylamide gels are  often used to evaluate treatment outcomes as they mimic the acoustic properties  and stiffness of a variety of soft tissues, but they do not exhibit high  toughness, a characteristic of fibrous connective tissue. To mimic pathologic  fibrous tissue found in benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and other diseases that  are potentially treatable with histotripsy, an optically transparent hydrogel  with high toughness was developed that is a hybrid of polyacrylamide and  alginate. The stiffness was established using shear wave elastography (SWE) and  indentometry techniques and was found to be representative of human BPH ex vivo  prostate tissue. Different phantom compositions and excised ex vivo BPH tissue  samples were treated with a 700-kHz histotripsy transducer at different pulse  repetition frequencies. Post-treatment, the hybrid gels and the tissue samples  exhibited differential reduction in stiffness as measured by SWE. On B-mode  ultrasound, partially treated areas were present as hyperechoic zones and fully  liquified areas as hypoechoic zones. Phase contrast microscopy of the gel samples  revealed liquefaction in regions consistent with the target lesion dimensions and  correlated to findings identified in tissue samples via histology. The dose  required to achieve liquefaction in the hybrid gel was similar to what has been  observed in ex vivo tissue and greater than that of agarose of comparable or  higher Young's modulus by a factor >10. These results indicate that the developed  hydrogels closely mimic elasticities found in BPH prostate ex vivo tissue and  have a similar response to histotripsy treatment, thus making them a useful  cost-effective alternative for developing and evaluating different treatment  protocols.","2022-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1762-1777","","9","48","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

METHODS AND MATERIAL: GM-CSF and IL-4  were used to culture the mouse bone marrow-derived DC. HIFU was used to prepare  CT-26 tumor cell antigen-sensitive DC vaccines. The capability of T cell  proliferation was detected by (3)H-TdR, and the CTL cytotoxicity was detected  using standard 4h(51)Cr release assay. The DC-based tumor vaccine prepared using  HIFU irradiation was given to normal BALB/c mice. The mice were injected with  CT-26 cancer cells subcutaneously seven days later. Further, the occurrence time  of the tumor, its weight and volume on the 20(th) day was observed, and the  allergic DC group challenged using repeated-freezing-thawing method alone with  the normal saline control group (negative control group) were used to compare  group differences. RESULTS: DC in the HIFU group, tumor cell freeze-thawing  group, tumor supernatant group, and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) group could  induce T cell proliferation in vitro. However, the ability to induce T cell  proliferation of DC in the HIFU group and tumor cell freeze-thawing group was  significantly higher than those in the tumor supernatant and PBS groups (P < 0.  05). CTL induced in vitro by DC in the HIFU group, and the tumor cell  freeze-thawing group had significant cytotoxicity to colon cancer, being  significantly different from those in the tumor supernatant and PBS groups (P <  0.05). There was no significant difference between the cytotoxicity of CTL  induced in vitro in the HIFU group and the tumor cell freeze-thawing group (P >  0.05). Additionally, significant differences in the occurrence time of the tumor,  its weight and volume on the 20(th) day, and the median survival time of mice  among the HIFU group, the repeated-freezing-thawing group, and the negative  control group were observed (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). There was a significant  difference between the HIFU and the repeated-freezing-thawing group (P < 0.05).  CONCLUSIONS: HIFU prepared antigen-sensitized DC could cause substantial  proliferation of T cells and CTL with strong anti-tumor effects. The DC-based  tumor vaccine prepared using HIFU irradiation affected active immunization on the  tumor occurrence in vitro and was better than the DC-based tumor vaccine prepared  using the repeated-freezing-thawing method.","2022-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1292-1298","","5","18","","J Cancer Res Ther","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: India PMID: 36204875","","","","*Cancer Vaccines/pharmacology; *Colonic Neoplasms/pathology; Animals; Antigens, Neoplasm; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytotoxic T lymphocyte; Dendritic Cells; Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Interleukin-4; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Phosphates/pharmacology; Saline Solution/pharmacology; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; Ultrasonic Waves; dendritic cells; high intensity focused ultrasound; neoplasm antigens","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Post-HIFU MRIs of 110 consecutive patients who  underwent follow-up biopsies between August 2019 and April 2021 were  retrospectively analyzed and the likelihood of recurrence was assessed on a  five-point Likert scale by two board-certified uroradiologists. Diagnostic  performance of the Likert scale assigned to the post-HIFU MRI was assessed using  the follow-up biopsy results as a reference standard. Among the clinical and  radiological variables, predictors of the recurrence were examined through  logistic regression. RESULTS: In per-patient and per-sector analyses, Likert  scale on post-HIFU MRI showed a sensitivity and specificity of 0.37 and 0.97, and  0.42 and 0.87, respectively, in predicting recurrence. Two patients with high  suspicion on MRI required additional treatment to regain biochemical control  despite negative biopsies. High suspicion on post-HIFU MRI (odds ratio = 1.74;  p < 0.01), and more cancer-positive cores on initial biopsy (odds ratio = 1.25;  p = 0.03) were independent predictors of recurrence. CONCLUSION: Albeit with low  sensitivity, high suspicion on post-HIFU MRI may be clinically important because  of its high specificity, especially when considering the possibility of sampling  error in biopsies. Patients with a high number of cancer-positive cores at  diagnosis should avoid HIFU as they have an increased risk of recurrence.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","360-366","","2","26","","Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

METHODS: A total  of 73 men with localized prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled and  underwent focal HIFU followed by per-protocol PSA and mpMRI with systematic plus  targeted biopsies at 12 months after treatment. We evaluated the association  between post-treatment mpMRI and PSA with disease persistence on the  post-ablation biopsy. We also assessed post-treatment functional and oncological  outcomes. RESULTS: Median age was 69 years (Interquartile Range (IQR): 66-74) and  median PSA was 6.9 ng/dL (IQR: 5.3-9.9). Of 19 men with persistent GG ≥ 2  disease, 58% (11 men) had no visible lesions on MRI. In the 14 men with PIRADS 4  or 5 lesions, 7 (50%) had either no cancer or GG 1 cancer at biopsy. Men with  false negative mpMRI findings had higher PSA density (0.16 vs. 0.07 ng/mL(2),  P = 0.01). No change occurred in the mean Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM)  survey scores (17.0 at baseline vs. 17.7 post-treatment, P = 0.75) or  International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (8.1 at baseline vs. 7.7 at 24  months, P = 0.81) after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent GG ≥ 2 cancer may  occur after focal HIFU. mpMRI alone without confirmatory biopsy may be  insufficient to rule out residual cancer, especially in patients with higher PSA  density.

METHODS: This retrospective study  included 688 women with uterine fibroids treated by USgHIFU; based on  post-treatment MRI, the patients were divided into two groups: endopelvic fascial  edema group and nonedema group. The specific location of fascial edema of each  patient was also recorded. Fascial edema and fibroid features and treatment  parameters were set as the dependent and independent variables, respectively, and  the correlations were studied using univariate and multivariate analyses. The  relationship between the pain-related adverse events and location of fascial  edema was analyzed by χ(2) and fisher's exact tests.

We included studies  providing 2×2 contingency table for diagnostic performance of MRI in predicting  recurrent PCa after HIFU, using control biopsy as reference standard. The quality  of the included studies was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic  Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Sensitivity and specificity were pooled and  displayed in a summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) plot.  Meta-regression analysis using clinically relevant covariates was performed for  the causes of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Nineteen studies (703 patients) were  included. All included studies satisfied at least four of the seven QUADAS-2  domains. Pooled sensitivity was 0.81 (95% CI 0.72-0.90) with specificity of 0.91  (95% CI 0.86-0.96), with area under the SROC curve of 0.81. Larger studies  including more than 50 patients showed relatively poor sensitivity (0.68 vs.  0.84) and specificity (0.75 vs. 0.93). The diagnostic performance of studies  reporting higher nadir serum prostate-specific antigen levels (>1 ng/mL) after  HIFU was inferior, and differed significantly in sensitivity (0.54 vs. 0.78)  rather than specificity (0.85 vs. 0.91).

Conventional displacement detection methods assume neighborhood  uniformity and cannot achieve both high spatial resolution and sub-pixel  displacement detection. METHODS: A deep-learning network that utilizes ultrasound  images and output displacement distribution was developed. The network structure  was constructed by modifying FlowNet2, a widely used network for optical flow  estimation, and a training dataset was developed using ultrasound image  simulation. Detection accuracy and spatial resolution were evaluated via  simulated ultrasound images, and the clinical usefulness was evaluated with  ultrasound images of the liver exposed to high-intensity-focused ultrasound  (HIFU). These results were compared to the Lucas-Kanade method, a conventional  sub-pixel displacement detection method. RESULTS: For a displacement  within ± 40 µm (± 0.6 pixels), a pixel size of 67 µm, and signal noise of 1%, the  accuracy was above 0.5 µm and 0.2 µm, the precision was above 0.4 µm and 0.3 µm,  and the spatial resolution was 1.1 mm and 0.8 mm for the lateral and axial  displacements, respectively. These improvements were also observed in the  experimental data. Visualization of the lateral displacement distribution, which  determines the edge of the treated lesion using HIFU, was also realized.  CONCLUSION: Two-dimensional and sub-pixel displacement detection with high  spatial resolution was realized using a deep-learning methodology. The proposed  method enabled the monitoring of small and local tissue deformations induced by  HIFU exposure.","2022-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","3-15","","1","49","","J Med Ultrason (2001)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

However, treatment of GBM has been still challenged due to blood-brain barrier  (BBB). BBB prevents that the chemotherapeutic molecules are extravasated to  brain. In this study, sonosensitive liposome encapsulating doxorubicin (DOX) was  developed for enhancement of GBM penetration in combination with focused  ultrasound (FUS) and microbubbles. Upon ultrasound (US) irradiation, microbubbles  induce cavitation resulting in the tight junction of BBB endothelium to  temporarily open. In addition, the composition of sonosensitive liposome was  optimized by comparison of sonosensitivity and intracellular uptake to U87MG  cells. The optimal sonosensitive liposome, IMP301-DC, resulted 123.9 ± 38.2 nm in  size distribution and 98.2 % in loading efficiency. Related to sonosensitivity of  IMP301-DC, US-triggered release ratio of doxorubicin was 69.2 ± 12.3 % at  92 W/cm(2) of US intensity for 1 min. In the in vivo experiments, the  accumulation of DiD fluorescence probe labeled IMP301-DC-shell in the brain  through the BBB opening was increased more than two-fold compared to that of  Doxil-shell, non-sonosensitive liposome. US exposure significantly increased GBM  cytotoxicity of IMP301-DC. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that IMP301-DC  could serve as an alternative solution to enhance the penetration to GBM  treatment via BBB opening by non-invasive FUS combined with microbubbles.","2022-10","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","213102","","","141","","Biomater Adv","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Here we aim to gain insights  about the proposed neuron selective modulation of FUS and probe feedforward  versus feedback interactions by simultaneously quantifying the stimulus (FUS  pressures: 925, 425, 250 kPa) and response (% BOLD fMRI changes) function at the  targeted area 3a/3b and off-target cortical areas at 7T. In resting-state,  lowered intensities of FUS resulted in decreased fMRI signal changes at the  target area 3a/3b and off-target area 1/2, S2, MCC, insula and auditory cortex,  and no signal difference in thalamic VPL and MD nuclei. In activated states,  concurrent high-intensity FUS significantly enhanced touch-evoked signals in area  1/2. Medium- and low-intensity FUS significantly suppressed touch-evoked BOLD  signals in all areas except in the auditory cortex, VPL and MD thalamic nuclei.  Distinct state dependent and dose-response curves led us to hypothesize that  FUS's neuromodulatory effects may be mediated through preferential activation of  different populations of neurons. Area 3a/3b may have distinct causal feedforward  and feedback interactions with Area 1/2, S2, MCC, insula, and VPL.

Given promising pre-clinical results, a first  in-human trial was designed to assess the technical effectiveness and safety  profile of histotripsy, a noninvasive, non-thermal, non-ionizing focused  ultrasound therapy that creates precise, predictable tissue destruction, in  patients with primary and secondary liver tumors.Methods A multicenter phase I  trial (Theresa Study) was performed in a single country with 8 weeks of planned  follow-up. Eight of fourteen recruited patients were deemed eligible and enrolled  in the study. Hepatic histotripsy, was performed with a prototype system  (HistoSonics, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). Eleven tumors were targeted in the 8 patients  who all had unresectable end-stage multifocal liver tumors: colorectal liver  metastases (CRLM) in 5 patients (7 tumors), breast cancer metastases in 1 (1  tumor), cholangiocarcinoma metastases in 1 (2 tumors), and hepatocellular  carcinoma (HCC) in 1 (1 tumor). The primary endpoint was acute technical success,  defined as creating a zone of tissue destruction per planned volume assessed by  MRI 1-day post-procedure. Safety (device-related adverse events) through 2 months  was a secondary endpoint.Results The 8 patients had a median age of 60.4 years  with an average targeted tumor diameter of 1.4 cm. The primary endpoint was  achieved in all procedures. The secondary safety profile endpoint identified no  device-related adverse events. Two patients experienced a continuous decline in  tumor markers during the eight weeks following the procedure.Conclusions This  first-in-human trial demonstrates that hepatic histotripsy effectively destroys  liver tissue in a predictable manner, correlating very well with the planned  histotripsy volume, and has a high safety profile without any device-related  adverse events. Based on these results, the need for more definitive clinical  trials is warranted. Trial Registration: Study to Evaluate VORTX Rx (Theresa).

A safer and more  noninvasive approach involves the use of high-intensity focused ultrasonography  (HIFU) lasers, which work by selectively damaging fat tissue through apoptosis or  necrosis induction of fat cells. The authors' systematic review was designed to  identify the effectiveness of HIFU for nonsurgical facial and body contouring.  METHODS: An exhaustive literature search was conducted of the PubMed/MEDLINE,  Cochrane Central, Scopus, and EBSCO electronic databases for the period from  November of 2005 to July of 2020. The full text of selected articles was reviewed  for possible study inclusion, and articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria were  recruited. Characteristics of the included studies were noted, and outcomes were  assessed. Assessment of quality and risk of bias was performed for all the  studies using the RevMan tool and the methodological index for nonrandomized  studies. RESULTS: The initial search revealed a total of 4584 citations, of which  only 11 were included in the present review: nine used HIFU for recontouring of  the abdomen and only two used HIFU over the face and neck. Studies evaluated  either the efficacy of HIFU or the safety of its use. The average total energy  ranged from 140 to 248 J/cm 2 for the abdominal region and 0.3 to 1.2 J/cm 2 for  the face and neck. The focal depth ranged from 1.1 to 1.8 cm. All the studies  showed promising results with the use of HIFU.

However, these synergists have  certain limitations, such as poor tumor targeting and low accumulation at the  tumor site, that restrict the therapeutic efficacy of HIFU. In this study, we  utilized drug-loaded nanoparticles conjugated with genetically engineered  bacteria which can selectively colonize the hypoxic areas of tumor to facilitate  HIFU ablation. Genetically modified Escherichia coli carrying gas vesicles  (GVs-E. coli), which were gas-filled protein nanostructures, had a negatively  charged surface and could specifically target into the tumor. In contrast,  paclitaxel (PTX) and perfluorohexane (PFH) co-loaded cationic lipid nanoparticles  (PTX-CLs) had a positively charged surface, hence, GVs-E. coli was used as a  vehicle by conjugating with PTX-CLs via electrostatic adsorption and subsequently  attracting more PTX-CLs to the tumor site. To improve the therapeutic efficiency  of HIFU, the GVs in GVs-E. coli and PFH encapsulated in PTX-CLs could act as  cavitation nuclei to enhance the HIFU cavitation effect, while PTX entrapped in  PTX-CLs was released at the tumor site under HIFU irradiation, enhancing the  therapeutic efficacy of HIFU and chemo-synergistic therapy. This novel  combination strategy has great potential for cancer treatment.","2022-05-28","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","29-34","","","606","","Biochem Biophys Res Commun","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Rapid thrombolysis and  restoration of blood flow are vital to reduce the disability and death rate. The  objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of using a high-intensity  focused acoustic vortex (HIFAV) to enhance sonothrombolysis. The in vitro clots  were treated with HIFU with a peak negative pressure (PNP) of 2.86 MPa (HIFU A)  or 3.27 MPa (HIFU B) or HIFAV with a PNP of 2.14 MPa. The results revealed that  HIFAV thrombolysis could achieve a significantly higher efficiency than HIFU  (HIFAV: 65.4%, HIFU A: 24.1%, HIFU B: 31.6%, p < 0.01), even at a lower  intensity. The average size of the debris particles generated in HIFAV  thrombolysis was similar to that in HIFU. Additionally, the cavitation activities  were found to be more intense in HIFAV thrombolysis. Although the efficiency of  HIFAV thrombolysis was higher when the pulse repetition frequency increased from  100 to 500 Hz (41.4% vs. 65.4%, p < 0.05), it decreased when the PRF reached 1000  Hz (29.9%). Lastly, it was found that increasing the duty cycle from 5% to 15%  led to a higher efficiency in HIFAV thrombolysis (40.3% vs. 75.2%, p < 0.001).  This study illustrated that HIFAV provided enhanced thrombolysis and that its  efficiency could be further increased by optimizing the ultrasound parameters.","2022-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1907-1917","","9","48","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Targeted image-guided cancer therapy has gained  acceptance through improved PCa detection, localization, and characterization by  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Minimally-invasive ablative techniques aim to  achieve comparable oncological outcomes to radical treatment while preserving  genitourinary function. Transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA) and  next-generation transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) utilize MRI  guidance to thermally ablate prostate tissue under real-time MRI monitoring and  active temperature feedback control. Previous trials performed by our group and  others, including a large multicenter study in men with localized favorable-risk  disease, have demonstrated that TULSA provides effective prostate ablation with a  favorable safety profile and low impact on quality of life.

RevMan5.4 software was used for the data  analysis. The primary outcome was changes in volume of the uterine. Secondary  outcomes included visual analog scale (VAS) scores for dysmenorrhea, serum CA125  level, recurrence rate, changes in volume of the adenomyotic lesion, menstrual  volume scores, and adverse reactions. Data synthesis was conducted using a  random-effects model with significant heterogeneity (I(2) > 50%), and using a  fixed-effects model otherwise. This study is registered on the PROSPERO platform  (CRD42021295214). RESULTS: The final analysis included 13 studies, with a total  of 1861 patients. Results of analysis revealed that there was no significant  difference in uterine volume reduction between the HIFU control group and the  HIFU/LNG-IUS group at 3 months after procedure (MD:30.63). Compared with the HIFU  control group, the HIFU/LNG-IUS group had more pronounced reduction in uterine  volume at 6 (MD:29.04) and 12 months (MD:22.10) after procedure. The HIFU/LNG-IUS  group has lower VAS scores for dysmenorrhea than the HIFU control group at 3  (MD:1.68), 6 (MD:1.69), and 12 months (MD:1.30) after procedure.

An ultrasound guided focused ultrasound system was  designed to accommodate a rotating imaging transducer within a low frequency  therapeutic transducer that operates at a center frequency of 105 kHz. The  implementation of this integrated system provides real-time therapeutic and  volumetric imaging functions, that are used here for low-cost, low-energy 3D  volumetric ultrasound histotripsy using nanodroplets. A two-step approach for low  pressure histotripsy is implemented with this dual-array. Vaporization of  nanodroplets into gaseous microbubbles was performed via the 1D rotating imaging  probe. The therapeutic transducer is then used to detonate the vaporized  nanodroplets and trigger potent mechanical effects in the surrounding tissue.  Rotating the imaging transducer creates a circular vaporized nanodroplet shape  which generates a round lesion upon detonation. This contrasts with the elongated  lesion formed when using a standard 1D imaging transducer for nanodroplet  activation. Optimization experiments show that maximal nanodroplet activation can  be achieved with a 2-cycle excitation pulse at a center frequency of 3.5 MHz, and  a peak negative pressure of 3.4 MPa (a mechanical index of 1.84). Vaporized  nanodroplet detonation was achieved by applying a low frequency treatment at a  center frequency of 105 kHz and mechanical index of 0.9. In ex-vivo samples, the  rotated nanodroplet activation method yielded the largest lesion area, with a  mean of 4.7 ± 0.5 mm(2), and a rounded shape. In comparison, standard fixed  transducer nanodroplet activation resulted in an average lesion area of 2.6 ± 0.4  mm(2), and an elongated shape. This hybrid system enables to achieve volumetric  low energy histotripsy, and thus facilitates the creation of precise,  large-volume mechanical lesions in tissues, while reducing the pressure threshold  required for standard histotripsy by over an order of magnitude.","2022-11-30","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","20664","","1","12","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

This study collected and analysed the clinical data  of patients who underwent UCP to observe the efficacy and safety of this surgery  in Chinese glaucoma patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. The  clinical data of all the patients who underwent UCP at Affiliated Foshan  Hospital, Southern Medical University, were collected and analysed to evaluate  the efficacy and safety of UCP. The main outcome measure was intraocular  pressure, and the secondary outcome measures were best corrected visual acuity  (logMAR) and complications. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients (61 eyes) were  recruited for this study. IOP was dramatically decreased during the 12 months  after UCP (p<0.05). The median IOP reduction during the 18 months post-procedure  was more than 30%. The greatest reduction was at 1 month post-UCP (60.86%). The  qualified success rate was more than 60% during the 18-month follow-up (Fig. 1).  Poor follow up was found after 6-month post-UCP. The highest success rate was  obtained at 7 days post-UCP (94.55%). No statistically significant decrease in  BCVA in the vison group was observed at the follow-up visits, except for 1 day  post-UCP. There was a statistically significant reduction in the use of IOP  lowering medications during the 6 months post-UCP. No severe complications  occurred. CONCLUSION: UCP is a safe and effective procedure for primary and  refractive glaucoma at least during the 6 months post-UCP procedure. Studies with  longer follow-up time and better follow up are needed to further confirm the  long-term efficacy and safety of UCP in Chinese glaucoma patients.","2022-10-07","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","401","","1","22","","BMC Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Initial performance evaluation of a system for simultaneous high-resolution ultrasound imaging and focused mechanical submillimeter  histotripsy ablation in rat brains. Impact Statement. This study used a novel  combination of high-resolution imaging and histotripsy in an endoscopic form.  This would provide neurosurgeons with unprecedented accuracy in targeting and  executing nonthermal ablations in minimally invasive surgeries. Introduction.  Histotripsy is a safe and effective nonthermal focused ablation technique.  However, neurosurgical applications, such as brain tumor ablation, are difficult  due to the presence of the skull. Current devices are too large to use in the  minimally invasive approaches surgeons prefer. We have developed a combined  imaging and histotripsy endoscope to provide neurosurgeons with a new tool for  this application. Methods. The histotripsy component had a 10 mm diameter,  operating at 6.3 MHz. Affixed within a cutout hole in its center was a 30 MHz  ultrasound imaging array. This coregistered pair was used to ablate brain tissue  of anesthetized rats while imaging. Histological sections were examined, and  qualitative descriptions of ablations and basic shape descriptive statistics were  generated. Results. Complete ablations with submillimeter area were produced in  seconds, including with a moving device. Ablation progress could be monitored in  real time using power Doppler imaging, and B-mode was effective for monitoring  post-ablation bleeding. Collateral damage was minimal, with a 100 μm maximum  distance of cellular damage from the ablation margin. Conclusion. The results  demonstrate a promising hardware suite to enable precision ablations in  endoscopic procedures or fundamental preclinical research in histotripsy,  neuroscience, and cancer.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","9794321","","","2022","","BME Front","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Thomas G.

It has a high  mortality rate and is often unresponsive to the standard of care, which includes  surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. These treatment strategies are  also hindered by their invasiveness and toxic effects on healthy cells and  tissues. Furthermore, the blood-brain/tumor barrier severely limits delivery of  anti-cancer therapeutics administered intravenously to brain tumors, resulting in  poor tumor response to the treatment. There is a critical need to develop new  approaches to brain cancer therapy that can overcome these limitations. Focused  ultrasound has emerged as a modality that addresses many of these limitations and  has the potential to alter the treatment paradigm for brain cancer. Ultrasound  transmitted through the skull can be focused on tumors and used for targeted  ablation or opening the vascular barriers for drug delivery. This review provides  insight on the current status of these unique ultrasound techniques, different  strategies of using this technique for brain cancer, experience in preclinical  models, and potential for clinical translation. We also debate the safety  perspective of these techniques and discuss potential avenues for future work in  noninvasive planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the ultrasonic  neurointervention.","2022-03","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","23-34","","1","24","","Neuromolecular Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.
