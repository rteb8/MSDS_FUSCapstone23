They are usually performed in combination with other treatment modalities,  including lasers and energy-based devices, to enhance cosmetic results.  Theoretically, HA and other filler injections should be performed after laser- or  energy-based device treatments. In some instances, however, practitioners are  asked to administer laser- or energy-based device treatment after HA dermal  filler injection. There is a concerning possibility of HA filler degradation as a  result of bulk heating generated by lasers or energy-based devices, especially  radiofrequency (RF). AIM: To evaluate the effect of RF treatment at different  time points on HA degradation in vivo, using clinicohistological analysis.  PATIENTS/METHODS: Fourteen volunteers were recruited and received intradermal HA  filler injections in four sites on the abdomen. One site served as the control,  and the other three sites were treated with monopolar RF on the same day after  injection, at 14 and 28 days post-injection. Skin biopsies were performed at  baseline and 56 days after HA injection. Histopathological sections were reviewed  for residual filler in the tissue. RESULTS: The results showed that HA grading  scores decreased in five (35.71%), one (7.14%), and one (7.14%) participants when  RF was performed immediately, 14 and 28 days after injection, respectively.  CONCLUSION: In conclusion, RF treatment after HA filler injection may affect the  integrity of the HA filler in the tissue, especially if RF treatment was  performed on the same day after HA injection.","2023-03","2024-03-06 17:09:54","2024-03-06T17:09:54Z","","798-803","","3","22","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

HA filler injection is  generally recommended after MFU if combined treatment is required in a single  visit. However, data regarding the safe and optimal time of MFU treatment after  HA injection is still limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the  degree of HA loss when performing MFU treatment after dermal filler injection.  METHODS: Fourteen subjects were recruited in this pilot study. HA was injected  intradermally on four 2 × 2 cm areas at the abdomen (0.25 ml/site). Site A was  served as control whereas site B, C, D were treated with MFU using 1.5 mm  transducer at 60 min, Day 14, and Day 28 after the injection, respectively. All  experimental sites were biopsied using a 3-mm punch biopsy to evaluate the  histopathological profile at baseline and Day 56. Grading of the quantity of  retained HA was evaluated by a blinded experienced dermatopathologist. RESULTS:  All 14 subjects completed the study. One subject has been excluded due to the  poor quality of histopathologic slides. Seven subjects (53.9%) at site B and 6  subjects (46.2%) at site C had HA loss at Day 56 compared with baseline. The mean  HA grading at baseline and Day 56 was 3.7 vs. 2.8 (p < 0.001) at site B and 3.7  vs. 3.0 (p = 0.001) at site C, respectively. There was no statistical difference  between the mean HA grading at baseline and Day 56 at site D (3.7 vs. 3.3,  p = 0.073). No inflammation or granuloma was observed on Day 56 of the study.  CONCLUSIONS: MFU treatment after HA injection appears to be safe. However, some  degree of HA loss was observed if MFU treatment was done within 2 weeks after HA  injection.","2023-03","2024-03-06 17:09:53","2024-03-06T17:09:53Z","","792-797","","3","22","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

METHODS: Sixty-one patients (62 eyes) with primary and  secondary glaucoma were enrolled to undergo UCP. The primary outcome measures  were intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, success rates, glaucoma medication use  and visual acuity after UCP. An IOP reduction of 20% compared to the baseline  value without re-intervention was considered a successful treatment. Complete  success was defined as cessation of antiglaucoma medications. Secondary outcome  measures included intraoperative and postoperative complications. Measurements  were performed preoperatively and at the first week, and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30  and 36 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients (41 eyes) were  evaluated 36-month after UCP. The mean ± SD values of IOP preoperatively at  1 day, 1 week, 1; 3; 6; 12; 18; 24; 30 and 36 months postoperatively were  22.7 ± 5.0 mmHg, 17.1 ± 4.2 mmHg (p < 0.001), 15.7 ± 4.8 mmHg (p < 0.001),  18.8 ± 4.8 mmHg (p < 0.001), 17.3 ± 3.7 mmHg (p < 0.001), 16.9 ± 3.2 mmHg  (p < 0.001), 16.6 ± 2.7 mmHg (p < 0.001), 16.3 ± 3.0 mmHg (p < 0.001),  15.8 ± 3.4 mmHg (p < 0.001), 15.3 ± 2.1 mmHg (p < 0.001) and 16.3 ± 3.0 mmHg  (p < 0.001), respectively. The mean IOP at the last follow-up was reduced by  28.5%. The qualified success rate was 64.0%. All patients at 36-month follow-up  visit required the use of antiglaucoma medications - none of the patients  achieved complete success. The decrease in the number of antiglaucoma medications  was statistically significant at each follow-up visit compared to the baseline.  Choroid detachment was observed in three patients (4.8%), while macular oedema  was observed in three patients (4.8%) after the procedure. No other major  intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound  ciliary plasty seems to be an effective and well-tolerated method to reduce IOP  in patients with refractory glaucoma. Further studies with a larger group are  needed to confirm the efficacy of this procedure.","2023-05","2024-03-06 17:08:43","2024-03-06T17:08:43Z","","293-300","","3","101","","Acta Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

The length of time to healing is an important factor in determining a person's  recovery after a fracture. Ultrasound may have a therapeutic role in reducing the  time to union after fracture by stimulating osteoblasts and other bone-forming  proteins. This is an update of a review previously published in February 2014.    OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of low-intensity ultrasound (LIPUS),  high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFUS) and extracorporeal shockwave therapies  (ECSW) as part of the treatment of acute fractures in adults.  SEARCH METHODS: We  searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE,  Embase (1980 to March 2022), Orthopaedic Proceedings, trial registers and  reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised  controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs including participants over 18 years of  age with acute fractures (complete or stress fractures) treated with either  LIPUS, HIFUS or ECSW versus a control or placebo-control. DATA COLLECTION AND  ANALYSIS: We used standard methodology expected by Cochrane. We collected data  for the following critical outcomes: participant-reported quality of life,  quantitative functional improvement, time to return to normal activities, time to  fracture union, pain, delayed or non-union of fracture. We also collected data  for treatment-related adverse events. We collected data in the short term (up to  three months after surgery) and in the medium term (later than three months after  surgery).   MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 studies, involving 1543 fractures in  1517 participants; two studies were quasi-RCTs. Twenty studies tested LIPUS and  one trial tested ECSW; no studies tested HIFUS. Four studies did not report any  of the critical outcomes. All studies had unclear or high risk of bias in at  least one domain. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded for imprecision,  risk of bias and inconsistency. LIPUS versus control (20 studies, 1459  participants) We found very low-certainty evidence for the effect of LIPUS on  Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measured by SF-36 at up to one year after  surgery for lower limb fractures (mean difference (MD) 0.06, 95% confidence  interval (CI) -3.85 to 3.97, favours LIPUS; 3 studies, 393 participants). This  result was compatible with a clinically important difference of 3 units with both  LIPUS or control. There may be little to no difference in time to return to work  after people had complete fractures of the upper or lower limbs (MD 1.96 days,  95% CI -2.13 to 6.04, favours control; 2 studies, 370 participants; low-certainty  evidence).  There is probably little or no difference in delayed union or  non-union up to 12 months after surgery (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.09, favours  control; 7 studies, 746 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Although data  for delayed and non-union included both upper and lower limbs, we noted that  there were no incidences of delayed or non-union in upper limb fractures. We did  not pool data for time to fracture union (11 studies, 887 participants; very  low-certainty evidence) because of substantial statistical heterogeneity which we  could not explain. In upper limb fractures, MDs ranged from 0.32 to 40 fewer days  to fracture union with LIPUS. In lower limb fractures, MDs ranged from 88 fewer  days to 30 more days to fracture union. We also did not pool data for pain  experienced at one month after surgery in people with upper limb fractures (2  studies, 148 participants; very low-certainty evidence) because of substantial  unexplained statistical heterogeneity. Using a 10-point visual analogue scale,  one study reported less pain with LIPUS (MD -1.7, 95% CI -3.03 to -0.37; 47  participants), and the effect was less precise in the other study (MD -0.4, 95%  CI -0.61 to 0.53; 101 participants). We found little or no difference in skin  irritation (a possible treatment-related adverse event) between groups but judged  the certainty of the evidence from this small study to be very low (RR 0.94, 95%  CI 0.06 to 14.65; 1 study, 101 participants). No studies reported data for  functional recovery. Data for treatment adherence were inconsistently reported  across studies, but was generally described to be good. Data for costs were  reported for one study, with higher direct costs, as well as combined direct and  indirect costs, for LIPUS use. ECSW versus control (1 study, 56 participants) We  are uncertain whether ECSW reduces pain at 12 months after surgery in fractures  of the lower limb (MD -0.62, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.27, favours ECSW); the difference  between pain scores was unlikely to be clinically important, and the certainty of  the evidence was very low. We are also uncertain of the effect of ECSW on delayed  or non-union at 12 months because the certainty of this evidence is very low (RR  0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.01; 1 study, 57 participants). There were no  treatment-related adverse events. This study reported no data for HRQoL,  functional recovery, time to return to normal activities, or time to fracture  union. In addition, no data were available for adherence or cost. AUTHORS'  CONCLUSIONS: We were uncertain of the effectiveness of ultrasound and shock wave  therapy for acute fractures in terms of patient-reported outcome measures  (PROMS), for which few studies reported data. It is probable that LIPUS makes  little or no difference to delayed union or non-union. Future trials should be  double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials recording validated PROMs and  following up all trial participants. Whilst time to union is difficult to  measure, the proportion of participants achieving clinical and radiographic union  at each follow-up point should be ascertained, alongside adherence with the study  protocol and cost of treatment in order to better inform clinical practice.","2023-03-03","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","CD008579","","3","3","","Cochrane Database Syst Rev","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Cochrane Collaboration.

NDs with shells comprised of  polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based polymers could effectively suppressed the uptake  of RES, but the phase transition, contrast-enhanced imaging and drug release  about these NDs have not been well illuminated. METHODS: Folate receptor targeted  NDs with shells of polymers and loaded with DOX (FA-NDs/DOX) were prepared. The  particle size distribution and morphology of NDs was characterized with dynamic  light scattering (DLS) and microscope. Phase transition and contrast-enhanced  ultrasound imaging under different mechanical indices (MIs) was studied, and the  intensity of contrast enhancement were quantitatively analyzed. The targeting  property of FA-NDs/DOX to MDA-MB-231 cells and cellular uptake were observed  using a fluorescence microscope. The anti-tumor effects of FA-NDs/DOX combined  with low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) was studied through cytotoxicity  tests. Flow cytometry assays were used to detect cell apoptosis. RESULTS: The  average particle size of the FA-NDs/DOX was 448.0 ± 8.9 nm, and the zeta  potential was 30.4 ± 0.3 mV. When exposed to ultrasound at 37 °C, ultrasound  contrast enhancement of FA-NDs/DOX was observed when MI ≥0.19. A stronger  acoustic signal was observed under higher MIs and concentrations. The results of  quantitative analysis showed that the contrast enhancement intensity of  FA-NDs/DOX (1.5 mg/mL) at MI of 0.19, 0.29 and 0.48 was 26.6 ± 0.9 dB, 97.0 ± 3.8  dB and 153.1 ± 5.7 dB, respectively. The contrast enhancement of the FA-NDs/DOX  lasted for more than 30 minutes at an MI of 0.48. In targeting experiments,  FA-NDs could be recognized by MDA-MB-231 cells, and significant cellular uptake  was observed. The blank FA-NDs showed good biocompatibility, while the FA-NDs/DOX  induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. By combining LIFU irradiation  and FA-NDs/DOX treatment, the best cell-killing effect was achieved. CONCLUSIONS:  The FA-NDs/DOX prepared in this study has excellent performance in  contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging, tumor targeting and enhanced chemotherapy.  This FA-NDs/DOX with polymer shells provides a novel platform for ultrasound  molecular imaging and tumor therapy.","2023-06-14","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","115","","6","28","","Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Author(s).

However,  ultrasound pulse-echo sonography imaging the brain vasculatures has been limited  to narrow acoustic windows and low frequencies due to the distortion of the skull  bone, which sacrifices axial resolution since it is pulse length dependent.  PURPOSE: To overcome the detect limit, a large aperture 256-module sparse  hemispherical transmit/receive array was used to visualize the acoustic emissions  of ultrasound-vaporized lipid-coated decafluorobutane nanodroplets flowing  through tube phantoms and within rabbit cerebral vasculature in vivo via passive  acoustic mapping and super resolution techniques. METHODS: Nanodroplets were  vaporized with 55 kHz burst-mode ultrasound (burst length = 145 μs, burst  repetition frequency = 9-45 Hz, peak negative acoustic pressure = 0.10-0.22 MPa),  which propagates through overlying tissues well without suffering from severe  distortions. The resulting emissions were received at a higher frequency (612 or  1224 kHz subarray) to improve the resulting spatial resolution during passive  beamforming. Normal resolution three-dimensional images were formed using a  delay, sum, and integrate beamforming algorithm, and super-resolved images were  extracted via Gaussian fitting of the estimated point-spread-function to the  normal resolution data. RESULTS: With super resolution techniques, the mean  lateral (axial) full-width-at-half-maximum image intensity was 16 ± 3  (32 ± 6) μm, and 7 ± 1 (15 ± 2) μm corresponding to ∼1/67 of the normal  resolution at 612 and 1224 kHz, respectively. The mean positional uncertainties  were ∼1/350 (lateral) and ∼1/180 (axial) of the receive wavelength in water. In  addition, a temporal correlation between nanodroplet vaporization and the  transmit waveform shape was observed, which may provide the opportunity to  enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in future studies. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we  demonstrate the feasibility of vaporizing nanodroplets via low frequency  ultrasound and simultaneously performing spatial mapping via passive beamforming  at higher frequencies to improve the resulting spatial resolution of super  resolution imaging techniques. This method may enable complete four-dimensional  vascular mapping in organs where a hemispherical array could be positioned to  surround the target, such as the brain, breast, or testicles.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","7478-7497","","12","50","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37702919  PMCID: PMC10872837","","","","*Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods; *Ultrasonic Therapy/methods; Animals; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Phantoms, Imaging; Rabbits; Skull/diagnostic imaging; Ultrasonography/methods; focused ultrasound; nanodroplet; passive acoustic mapping; super resolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included  patients with uncontrolled glaucoma who underwent UCP as an initial glaucoma  procedure. The main outcome measures were intraocular pressure (IOP), the number  of antiglaucoma medications, visual acuity, and the presence of  vision-threatening complications. Surgical outcomes of each eye were classified  as either complete success, qualified success, or failure based on the main  outcome measures. Differences in IOP control and success rates were compared in  eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle-closure glaucoma  (PACG). RESULTS: We included 98 eyes of 88 patients in the study. The mean  follow-up period was 27.25 ± 10.1 months. At 12 and 24 months, mean IOP decreased  significantly from 23.16 ± 6.4 mmHg to 16.57 ± 6.0 mmHg and 16.18 ± 5.2 mmHg,  respectively, and the number of antiglaucoma medications decreased from  3.27 ± 0.9 to 1.86 ± 1.4 and 1.70 ± 1.7, respectively (p < .01 for all). There  were no changes in visual acuity throughout the follow-up compared with  preoperative levels.

The most common complications were cataract  development/progression, anterior chamber inflammation, and macular edema. There  were no significant differences in IOP, number of antiglaucoma medications, or  survival rates between POAG and PACG groups.

Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is often used for evaluating  patients intolerant to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. We performed DISE  with concurrent hyoid-focused ultrasonography to quantify hyoid dynamics during  obstructive and non-obstructive breathing. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis  from a prospective cohort of patients undergoing DISE with PAP titration  (DISE-PAP) and hyoid-focused ultrasound was conducted. Hyoid ultrasound was  performed during obstructive breathing, and non-obstructive breathing after PAP  administration. Motion was quantified by generating displacement curves based on  echo-tracking hyoid movement. The image analysis protocol for quantifying hyoid  displacement was performed independently by two researchers, and reliability of  measures was assessed. Univariate and multivariate regressions were performed for  various clinical data and hyoid displacement during obstructive breathing.  RESULTS: Twenty patients met inclusion criteria. On average, the cohort was male  (75%), elderly (65.9 ± 10 years), overweight (29.3 ± 3.99 kg/m(2) ), and with  moderate-to-severe OSA (29.3 ± 12.5 events/h). Mean hyoid displacement during  obstructive breathing was 5.81 mm (±3.48). In all patients, hyoid displacement  decreased after PAP administration (-3.94 mm [95% CI: -5.10, -2.78]; p < 0.0001).  Inter-rater reliability for measures of hyoid displacement was excellent. After  multivariate regression, hyoid displacement at baseline was associated with  higher AHI (β [95% CI] = 0.18 [0.03, 0.33], p = 0.020). CONCLUSION: During DISE,  hyoid displacement is greater during obstructive breathing with significant  variability amongst patients. Further, these ultrasonographic measurements had  excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability. Additional, larger studies are  needed to understand contributors to hyoid mobility.

Stretch marks are not serious health issues, but they may have a major  psychological effect on patients. Due to poor skin color improvement or prolonged  skin atrophy, there is no standard treatment for SD. Fillers have been studied  for their effectiveness in the treatment of SD. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review  aims to determine the efficacy of fillers on SD. METHODS: This systematic review  is reported following PRISMA guidance. We included all relevant articles  published up to November 2022 in the following electronic databases: Science  Direct, Midline, the Web of Science, CINAHL, and Google Scholar. The initial  search yielded 119, of which seven were included after applying inclusion and  exclusion criteria. RESULTS: The systematic review included a total of 184 female  participants who were over the age of 18 years old. Three studies used jet  volumetric remodeling (JVR) to inject HA pneumatically. One study injected  polycaprolactone filler. One study used calcium hydroxylapatite, micro-needling,  and ascorbic acid. MFU-V and CaHA were given in one study. One study delivered  MFU-V using micro-focused ultrasound. All studies showed that it reduces SD with  only mild, temporary side effects. More favor was given to combining CaHA and  MFU-V, which had the fewest side effects compared to other dermal fillers.  CONCLUSION: As monotherapy or combination therapy, injectable dermal fillers may  treat SD with minimal adverse effects. We suggest that more RCTs look into  injectable dermal filler to find out what is best for patients with SD and  compare it to other treatment methods in terms of results, costs, and side  effects to provide satisfactory practice and basic guideline interventions for  these cases.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","837-845","","","16","","Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Alsharif et al.","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 37033784  PMCID: PMC10078536","","","","Efficacy; Fillers; SD; striae distensae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sonogenetics for noninvasive  activation of neurons engineered to express thermosensitive transient receptor  potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) by transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) was  recently developed to address this need. However, using TRPV1-mediated  sonogenetics to evoke behavior by targeting the cortex is challenged by its  proximity to the skull due to high skull absorption of ultrasound and increased  risks of thermal-induced tissue damage.Objective.This study evaluated the  feasibility and safety of TRPV1-mediated sonogenetics in targeting the motor  cortex to modulate the locomotor behavior of freely moving  mice.Approach.Adeno-associated viral vectors was delivered to the mouse motor  cortex via intracranial injection to express TRPV1 in excitatory neurons. A  wearable FUS device was installed on the mouse head after a month to control  neuronal activity by activating virally expressed TRPV1 through FUS sonication at  different acoustic pressures. Immunohistochemistry staining ofex vivobrain slices  was performed to verify neuron activation and evaluate  safety.Results.TRPV1-mediated sonogenetic stimulation at 0.7 MPa successfully  evoked rotational behavior in the direction contralateral to the stimulation  site, activated cortical neurons as indicated by the upregulation of c-Fos, and  did not induce significant changes in inflammatory or apoptotic markers (GFAP,  Iba1, and Caspase-3). Sonogenetic stimulation of TRPV1 mice at a higher acoustic  pressure, 1.1 MPa, induced significant changes in motor behavior and upregulation  of c-Fos compared with FUS sonication of naïve mice at 1.1 MPa. However, signs of  damage at the meninges were observed at 1.1 MPa.Significance.TRPV1-mediated  sonogenetics can achieve effective and safe neuromodulation at the cortex with  carefully selected FUS parameters. These findings expand the application of this  technique to include superficial brain targets.","2023-02-27","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","1","20","","J Neural Eng","","","","","","","","eng","Creative Commons Attribution license.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36780694  PMCID: PMC9969813","","","","*Motor Cortex/physiology; *TRPV Cation Channels/genetics; Animals; Brain/physiology; Genetic Vectors; Head; Mice; Neurons; Skull; TRPV1; behavior; motor cortex; neuromodulation; sonogenetics; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, an  insufficient O(2) supply and the lack of a visual indication hinder further  applications of most nanoplatforms for solid tumor therapy. RESULTS: A  visualizable nanoplatform of liposome nanoparticles loaded with GOD, H(Gd), and  PFP and grafted with the peptide tLyP-1, named (tLyP-1)H(Gd)-GOD@PFP, was  constructed. The double-domain peptide tLyP-1 was used to specifically target and  penetrate the tumor cells; then, US imaging, starvation therapy and sonodynamic  therapy (SDT) were then achieved by the ultrasound (US)-activated cavitation  effect under the guidance of MR/PA imaging. GOD not only deprived the glucose for  starvation therapy but also produced H(2)O(2), which in coordination with (1)O(2)  produced by H(Gd), enable the effects of SDT to achieve a synergistic therapeutic  effect. Moreover, the synergistic therapy was enhanced by O(2) from PFP and  low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)-accelerated redox effects of the GOD. The  present study demonstrated that the nanoplatform could generate a 3.3-fold  increase in ROS, produce a 1.5-fold increase in the maximum rate of redox  reactions and a 2.3-fold increase in the O(2) supply in vitro, and achieve  significant tumor inhibition in vivo. CONCLUSION: We present a visualizable  nanoplatform with tumor-penetrating ability that can be unlocked by US to  overcome the current treatment problems by improving the controllability of the  O(2) supply, which ultimately synergistically enhanced cascade therapy.","2023-01-25","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","30","","1","21","","J Nanobiotechnology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Existing drugs on Aβ have been ineffective or offer only temporary  relief at best, due to blood-brain barrier or severe side effects. The study  employed thermal cycling-hyperthermia (TC-HT) to ease the Aβ-induced cognitive  impairments and compared its effect with continuous hyperthermia (HT) in vivo. It  established an AD mice model via intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of  Aβ(25-35), proving that TC-HT is much more effective in alleviating its  performance decline in Y-maze and novel object recognition (NOR) tests, in  comparison with HT. In addition, TC-HT also exhibits a better performance in  decreasing the hippocampal Aβ and β-secretase (BACE1) expressions as well as the  neuroinflammation markers-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) and  glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels. Furthermore, the study finds that  TC-HT can elevate more protein expressions of insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) and  antioxidative enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) than HT. In sum, the study  proves the potential of TC-HT in AD treatment, which can be put into application  with the use of focused ultrasound (FUS).","2023-07-27","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","137337","","","810","","Neurosci Lett","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Using the hybrid angular spectrum method (HAS), we simulated ultrasound  transmission through four model sets of different geometries involving sandwiched  layers of diploë and cortical bone in addition to three models generated from CT  images of ex-vivo human skull-bones. We characterized cost-function solution  spaces for each model and, using optimization, found that when a model possessed  appreciable variations in resolvable layer thickness, the predefined attenuation  coefficients could be found with low error (RMSE < 0.01 Np/cm). However, we  identified a spatial frequency cutoff in the models' geometry beyond which the  accuracy of the property determination begins to fail, depending on the frequency  of the ultrasound source. There was a large increase in error of the attenuation  coefficients determined by the optimization when the variations in layer  thickness were above the identified spatial frequency cutoffs, or when the  lateral variations across the model were relatively low in amplitude. For our  limited sample of three CT-image derived bone models, the attenuation  coefficients were determined successfully. The speed of sound values were  determined with low error for all models (including the CT-image derived models)  that were tested (RMSE < 0.4 m/s). These results illustrate that it is possible  to determine the acoustic properties of two-component models when the internal  bone structure is taken into account and the structure satisfies the spatial  frequency constraints discussed.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e3779","","12","39","","Int J Numer Method Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37794748  PMCID: PMC10841890","","","","*Acoustics; *Skull/diagnostic imaging; Computer Simulation; Head; Humans; Ultrasonography/methods; bone acoustic properties; bone attenuation; focused ultrasound; optimization; transcranial ultrasound; ultrasound modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: Bring the approach closer to translations by demonstrating sustained  modulation of deep brain circuits and choice behavior in task-performing  non-human primates. METHODS: Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound of 30 s in  duration was delivered in a controlled manner into deep brain targets (left or  right lateral geniculate nucleus; LGN) of non-human primates while the subjects  decided whether a left or a right visual target appeared first. While the animals  performed the task, we recorded intracranial EEG from occipital screws. The  ultrasound was delivered into the deep brain targets daily for a period of more  than 6 months. RESULTS: The brief stimulation induced effects on choice behavior  that persisted up to 15 minutes and were specific to the sonicated target.  Stimulation of the left/right LGN increased the proportion of rightward/leftward  choices. These effects were accompanied by an increase in gamma activity over  visual cortex. The contralateral effect on choice behavior and the increase in  gamma, compared to sham stimulation, suggest that the stimulation excited the  target neural circuits. There were no detrimental effects on the animals'  discrimination performance over the months-long course of the stimulation.  CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that brief, 30-s ultrasonic stimulation  induces neuroplastic effects specifically in the target deep brain circuits, and  that the stimulation can be applied daily without detrimental effects. These  findings encourage repeated applications of transcranial ultrasound to  malfunctioning deep brain circuits in humans with the goal of providing a durable  therapeutic reset.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","798-805","","3","16","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Due to skull attenuations at high ultrasound  (US) frequencies, successful tFUS with sufficient penetration depth requires  sub-MHz US waves, leading to relatively poor stimulation specificity particularly  in the axial direction (perpendicular to the US transducer). This shortcoming can  potentially be overcome by utilizing two individual US beams properly crossed in  time and space. For large-scale tFUS, a phased array is also required to  dynamically steer focused US beams at desired neural targets. This article  presents the theoretical foundation and optimization (through a wave-propagation  simulator) of crossed-beam formation using two US phased arrays. It also  experimentally validates crossed-beam formation with two custom-made 32-element  phased arrays (operating at 555.5 kHz) positioned relatively at different angles.  In measurements, the sub-MHz crossed-beam phased arrays achieved 0.8/3.4 mm  lateral/axial resolution at a focal distance of ∼ 46 mm, compared to the  lateral/axial resolution of 3.4/26.8 mm of the individual phased array at 50 mm  focal distance (∼ 28.4-fold improvement in reducing the main focal zone area).

We showed that Piezo1 knockout (P1KO) in the right motor cortex of  mice significantly reduced ultrasound-induced neuronal calcium responses, limb  movement, and muscle electromyogram (EMG) responses. We also detected higher  Piezo1 expression in the central amygdala (CEA), which was found to be more  sensitive to ultrasound stimulation than the cortex was.

The objective of this review is to discuss transarterial and  percutaneous therapies by examining the current literature, including  indications, patient selection, safety, and effectiveness. Transarterial  therapies (e.g., transarterial bland embolization and transarterial  chemoembolization) involve the delivery of either embolic or chemotherapeutic  particles using a catheter into arteries feeding the tumor, resulting in  localized tumor destruction. Percutaneous therapies (e.g., radiofrequency  ablation, cryoablation, irreversible electroporation, laser ablation, and  magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound) involve the delivery  of either hot or cold temperatures, electrical current, laser, or ultrasound to  specifically target tumor cells. Both therapies have been shown to be safe and  effective for reducing morbidity and local control of STTs, specifically in  patients who are surgically inoperable or who are unresponsive to conventional  therapies. Accurate diagnosis, staging, and histological subtype identification  are crucial for treatment selection.

A total of  3248 documents were identified from 1100 journal sources. A total of 390 articles  were published in 2022, with almost a 100% growth rate from previous years. Based  on the various network analysis, we conclude that the outcome of the constant  research in this domain will result in better patient care during the management  of various diseases, including cancer and other co-morbidities.","2023-08-21","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","16","23","","Sensors (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37631826  PMCID: PMC10458834","","","","*Cancer Pain; *Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging; Bibliometrics; Humans; Pain; Ultrasonography; acousitc waves; bibliometry; nociception; pain; tumor; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  mechanisms and neurochemical substrates underlying TUS neuromodulation in humans  and how these relate to excitation and inhibition are still poorly understood. In  24 healthy controls, we separately stimulated two deep cortical regions and  investigated the effects of theta-burst TUS, a protocol shown to increase  corticospinal excitability, on the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric  acid (GABA) and functional connectivity. We show that theta-burst TUS in humans  selectively reduces GABA levels in the posterior cingulate, but not the dorsal  anterior cingulate cortex. Functional connectivity increased following TUS in  both regions. Our findings suggest that TUS changes overall excitability by  reducing GABAergic inhibition and that changes in TUS-mediated neuroplasticity  last at least 50 mins after stimulation. The difference in TUS effects on the  posterior and anterior cingulate could suggest state- or location-dependency of  the TUS effect-both mechanisms increasingly recognized to influence the brain's  response to neuromodulation.","2023-09-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","5318","","1","14","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Each of these  techniques can effectively treat different neuropsychiatric disorders, but  treating any given disorder depends on choosing the right treatment target. Here,  we propose a three-phase framework for identifying and modulating these targets.  There are multiple approaches to identifying a target, including correlative  neuroimaging, retrospective optimization based on existing stimulation sites, and  lesion localization. These techniques can then be optimized using personalized  neuroimaging, physiological monitoring, and engagement of a specific brain state  using pharmacological or psychological interventions. Finally, a specific  stimulation modality or combination of modalities can be chosen after considering  the advantages and tradeoffs of each.

However, an  incompletely understood cellular specificity and a wide parameter space currently  limit the optimal application of FUS in preclinical and human studies. In this  perspective, we discuss how different FUS modalities can be utilized to achieve  short- and long-term improvements, thereby potentially treating brain disorders.  We review the ongoing efforts to determine which parameters induce neuronal  inhibition versus activation and how mechanoreceptors and signaling cascades are  activated to induce long-term changes, including memory improvements.

A focal therapy  multidisciplinary tumor board geared toward improving patient selection is a  novel concept which has not been reported. We describe our institution's initial  experience with a multidisciplinary tumor board for focal therapy and its  outcomes in terms of patient selection. METHODS: This was a single-center,  prospective study of patients referred to a multidisciplinary tumor board. All  prostate MRIs were re-reviewed by a single radiologist with >10 years of  experience, and the number, size, location, and Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data  System scores of lesions visible on MRI were recorded and compared to the  original report. Outside histopathology, when requested, was also re-reviewed for  cancer grade groups and adverse pathological features. A descriptive statistical  analysis was performed. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were presented at our  multidisciplinary tumor board (January-October 2022). Sixty-seven patients were  treatment naïve, while 7 had prior radiation±androgen deprivation therapy. MRI  overread was performed on all treatment-naïve patients (67/74 [91%]), while  pathology overreads were performed on 14/74 (19.9%). Following multidisciplinary  tumor board, 19 patients (25.6%) were deemed suitable candidates for focal  therapy. A total of 24 patients (35.8%) were not deemed candidates for high  intensity focused ultrasound focal therapy based exclusively on findings  identified at MRI overread. Pathology re-review changed management for 3/14  patients, with two-thirds being downgraded to grade group 1 disease and opting  for active surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary tumor board for focal  therapy is feasible. MRI overread is an essential component of this process and  demonstrates significant findings that alter eligibility or management in over a  third of patients.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","372-377","","4","10","","Urol Pract","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37103528","","","","*Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging; Androgen Antagonists; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Male; Prospective Studies; Prostate-Specific Antigen; magnetic resonance imaging; patient selection; prostatic neoplasms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They ensue following the anticipated absence of valid  behavioral options to alleviate an aversive state. One neural structure involved  in the detection of such options, is the cingulate cortex (CC), which conveys the  evaluation of behavior against the value of its outcome. Accordingly, CC-related  EEG measures are thought to correlate to feedback evaluation but also to anxious  and conflict-related states, signaling the need for further adaptation to current  requirements. Against this background, this study investigated the role of CC  functioning in the emergence and prevention of helpless/hopeless states by  applying low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (litFUS) neuromodulation  prior to a learned helplessness task. METHOD: In a randomized controlled double  blind experimental setup with 55 participants, litFUS was used to inhibit the  right lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC), a region closely connected to CC  modulation. Participants were instructed to play 8 games of chess against a  computer that was unbeatable to them, while an EEG was recorded. Theta  oscillation in midline electrodes, playing performance and self-rate measures on  cognitive, affective and physiological parameters were assessed. RESULTS: The  results show a considerable influence of litFUS neuromodulation of the lPFC on  midline theta activity (Fz and Pz electrode position) which in turn correlated to  several psychological variables including self-report data on emotion, cognition,  and arousal as well as behavioral measures (playing performance). LIMITATIONS:  Due to the small sample size and sample characteristics, results cannot be  generalized to the field of clinical application. A replication of results in  larger samples and in context of other sonication parameters is needed to  increase the robustness of results and to maximize the efficacy of litFUS  application. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the development of learned  helplessness/hopelessness could be positively influenced in its course by litFUS  neuromodulation of the right lPFC. In line with previous results, especially the  posterior midline electrode Pz seems to be an interesting target for further  research in this field as theta activity at this electrode is correlated to  control perception and motivated behavior. To our knowledge, this is the first  study to use neuromodulation to monitor and manipulate the development of  helplessness in the laboratory.","2023-05-15","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","273-284","","","329","","J Affect Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we report a tumor-homing bacterium, Bifidobacterium  bifidum (B. bifidum), adsorbing liposomes that encapsulate perfluorohexane (PFH)  and doxorubicin (DOX) to enhance the pulsed-focused ultrasound (PFUS) for tumor  therapy, so as to improve the efficacy, safety and controllability of ultrasound  treatment. Methods: The PFH and DOX co-loaded cationic liposomal nanoparticles  (CL-PFH-DOX-NPs) were prepared for ultrasound (US) imaging, cell-killing, and B.  bifidum adsorption for the reactive oxygen species (ROS) testing. The aggregation  of B. bifidum and CL-PFH-DOX-NPs is called tumor-homing aggregation (B.  bifidum@CL-PFH-DOX-NPs) in this study, and the synergistic effects of B.  bifidum@CL-PFH-DOX-NPs were analyzed in vivo. Results: Comprehensive studies  validated that CL-PFH-DOX-NPs can enhance US imaging and cell-killing and B.  bifidum can promote ROS, and B. bifidum@CL-PFH-DOX-NPs achieve PFUS synergism in  vivo. Importantly, active homing of B. bifidum facilitated the delivery and  retention of CL-PFH-DOX-NPs in tumors, reducing dispersion in normal tissues,  achieving the targeting ability of B. bifidum@CL-PFH-DOX-NPs. The best sonication  time was chosen according to the distribution of CL-PFH-DOX-NPs in vivo to  achieve efficient therapy. Especially, B. bifidum@CL-PFH-DOX-NPs amplified  cavitation and the immune-boosting effects. Conclusion: Multifunctional B.  bifidum@CL-PFH-DOX-NPs were successfully constructed with well targeting, which  not only realized US imaging monitoring, strong cavitation and complementary  killing during PFUS, but also achieved immunity enhancement after PFUS.

Presently, the poor accumulation of drug-carrying nanoparticles in tumors has  limited their success. In this study, based on a combination of the paradigms of  intravascular and extravascular drug release, an efficient nanosized drug  delivery system with programmable size changes is introduced. Drug-loaded smaller  nanoparticles (secondary nanoparticles), which are loaded inside larger  nanoparticles (primary nanoparticles), are released within the microvascular  network due to temperature field resulting from focused ultrasound. This leads to  the scale of the drug delivery system decreasing by 7.5 to 150 times.  Subsequently, smaller nanoparticles enter the tissue at high transvascular rates  and achieve higher accumulation, leading to higher penetration depths. In  response to the acidic pH of tumor microenvironment (according to the  distribution of oxygen), they begin to release the drug doxorubicin at very slow  rates (i.e., sustained release). To predict the performance and distribution of  therapeutic agents, a semi-realistic microvascular network is first generated  based on a sprouting angiogenesis model and the transport of therapeutic agents  is then investigated based on a developed multi-compartment model. The results  show that reducing the size of the primary and secondary nanoparticles can lead  to higher cell death rate. In addition, tumor growth can be inhibited for a  longer time by enhancing the bioavailability of the drug in the extracellular  space. The proposed drug delivery system can be very promising in clinical  applications. Furthermore, the proposed mathematical model is applicable to  broader applications to predict the performance of drug delivery systems.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2186312","","1","30","","Drug Deliv","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36895188  PMCID: PMC10013474","","","","*Nanoparticles/therapeutic use; *Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology; Cell Line, Tumor; Doxorubicin/pharmacology; Drug Carriers/pharmacology; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Liberation; Drug delivery; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Nanoparticle Drug Delivery System; Tumor Microenvironment; cancer nanomedicine; focused ultrasound; hyperthermia; multi-stage delivery system; pH-responsive nanoparticles; temperature-sensitive nanoparticles; tumor penetration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS AND RESULTS: SHRs were  treated with ultrasound stimulation of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray  (VlPAG) for 20 min every day for 2 months. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was  compared among normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats, SHR control group, SHR Sham group,  and SHR LIFU stimulation group. Cardiac ultrasound imaging and hematoxylin-eosin  and Masson staining of the heart and kidney were performed to assess target organ  damage. The c-fos immunofluorescence analysis and plasma levels of angiotensin  II, aldosterone, hydrocortisone, and endothelin-1 were measured to investigate  the neurohumoral and organ systems involved. We found that SBP was reduced from  172 ± 4.2 mmHg to 141 ± 2.1 mmHg after 1 month of LIFU stimulation, P  < 0.01.  The next month of treatment can maintain the rat's blood pressure at  146 ± 4.2 mmHg at the end of the experiment. LIFU stimulation reverses left  ventricular hypertrophy and improves heart and kidney function. Furthermore, LIFU  stimulation enhanced the neural activity from the VLPAG to the caudal  ventrolateral medulla and reduced the plasma levels of ANGII and Aldo.  CONCLUSION: We concluded that LIFU stimulation has a sustainable antihypertensive  effect and protects against target organ damage by activating antihypertensive  neural pathways from VLPAG to the caudal ventrolateral medulla and further  inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity, thereby supporting a  novel and noninvasive alternative therapy to treat hypertension.","2023-05-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","852-866","","5","41","","J Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

OBJECTIVE:  to make recommendations for monitoring treatment effects during and after MRgFUS  based on our investigation of correlations between different scales of tremor  severity. METHODS: twenty-five clinical assessments were collected from thirteen  patients before and after unilateral MRgFUS sequential lesioning of the thalamus  and posterior subthalamic area for alleviating essential tremor. Scales included  Bain Findley Spirography (BFS), Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST), Upper  Extremity Total Tremor Score (UETTS) and Quality of Life of Essential Tremor  (QUEST), and were documented at baseline, while lying in the scanner with  stereotactic frame attached (BFS), and at 24-month follow-up. RESULTS: the four  different scales of tremor severity all correlated significantly. BFS and CRST  showed a strong correlation of 0.833 (p < 0.001). BFS, UETTS and CRST correlated  moderately with QUEST (ρ = 0.575-0.721, p < 0.001).

The aims of the study described here were to  investigate whether FUS and MBs could improve the effect of chemotherapy in  patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer and to investigate the  safety and feasibility of using FUS + MBs. METHODS: We included 17 patients with  liver metastases from colorectal cancer, selected two lesions in each patient's  liver and randomized the lesions for, respectively, treatment with FUS + MBs or  control. After chemotherapy (FOLFIRI or FOLFOXIRI), the lesions were treated with  FUS (frequency = 1.67 MHz, mechanical index = 0.5, pulse repetition  frequency = 0.33 Hz, 33 oscillations, duty cycle = 0.2%-0.4% and MBs (SonoVue)  for 35 min). Nine boluses of MBs were injected intravenously at 3.5 min  intervals. Patients were scheduled for four cycles of treatment. Changes in the  size of metastases were determined from computed tomography images. RESULTS:  Treatment with FUS + MBs is safe at the settings used. There was considerable  variation in treatment response between lesions and mixed response between  lesions receiving only chemotherapy. There is a tendency toward larger-volume  reduction in lesions treated with FUS + MBs compared with control lesions, but a  mixed response to chemotherapy and lesion heterogeneity make it difficult to  interpret the results. CONCLUSION: The combination of FUS and MBs is a safe,  feasible and available strategy for improving the effect of chemotherapy in  cancer patients.

Stimulation of the unilateral  somatosensory circuits corresponding to the non-dominant hand generated EEG  evoked potentials across all participants; however, not all perceived  stimulation-mediated tactile sensations of the hand. These FUS-evoked EEG  potentials (FEP) were observed from both brain hemispheres and shared  similarities with somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) from median nerve  stimulation. Use of a 0.5 ms pulse duration (PD) sonication given at 70% duty  cycle, compared to the use of 1 and 2 ms PD, elicited more distinctive FEP peak  features from the hemisphere ipsilateral to sonication. Although several  participants reported hearing tones associated with FUS stimulation, the observed  FEP were not likely to be confounded by the auditory sensation based on a  separate measurement of auditory evoked potentials (AEP) to tonal stimulation  (mimicking the same repetition frequency as the FUS stimulation). Off-line  changes in resting-state functional connectivity (FC) associated with thalamic  stimulation revealed that the FUS stimulation enhanced connectivity in a network  of sensorimotor and sensory integration areas, which lasted for at least more  than an hour. Clinical neurological evaluations, EEG, and neuroanatomical MRI did  not reveal any adverse or unintended effects of sonication, attesting its safety.  These results suggest that FUS stimulation may induce long-term neuroplasticity  in humans, indicating its neurotherapeutic potential for various neurological and  neuropsychiatric conditions.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e0288654","","7","18","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright: © 2023 Kim et al.

METHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 3:1 ratio, patients with Parkinson's  disease and dyskinesias or motor fluctuations and motor impairment in the  off-medication state to undergo either focused ultrasound ablation opposite the  most symptomatic side of the body or a sham procedure. The primary outcome was a  response at 3 months, defined as a decrease of at least 3 points from baseline  either in the score on the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease  Rating Scale, part III (MDS-UPDRS III), for the treated side in the  off-medication state or in the score on the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale  (UDysRS) in the on-medication state. Secondary outcomes included changes from  baseline to month 3 in the scores on various parts of the MDS-UPDRS. After the  3-month blinded phase, an open-label phase lasted until 12 months. RESULTS: Of 94  patients, 69 were assigned to undergo ultrasound ablation (active treatment) and  25 to undergo the sham procedure (control); 65 patients and 22 patients,  respectively, completed the primary-outcome assessment. In the active-treatment  group, 45 patients (69%) had a response, as compared with 7 (32%) in the control  group (difference, 37 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 15 to 60;  P = 0.003). Of the patients in the active-treatment group who had a response, 19  met the MDS-UPDRS III criterion only, 8 met the UDysRS criterion only, and 18 met  both criteria. Results for secondary outcomes were generally in the same  direction as those for the primary outcome.

Pallidotomy-related adverse events  in the active-treatment group included dysarthria, gait disturbance, loss of  taste, visual disturbance, and facial weakness. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral pallidal  ultrasound ablation resulted in a higher percentage of patients who had improved  motor function or reduced dyskinesia than a sham procedure over a period of 3  months but was associated with adverse events.

With the existence of the blood-brain  barrier (BBB), it is particularly hard for therapeutic proteins like peptides,  enzymes, antibodies, etc. to enter the central nervous system (CNS) and function  in diagnosis and treatment in cerebral diseases. Fortunately, the past decade has  witnessed some emerging strategies of delivering macromolecular therapeutic  proteins across the BBB. AREAS COVERED: Based on the structure, functions, and  substances transport mechanisms, various enhanced delivery strategies of  therapeutic proteins were reviewed, categorized by molecule-mediated delivery  strategies, carrier-mediated delivery strategies, and other delivery strategies.  EXPERT OPINION: As for molecule-mediated delivery strategies, development of  genetic engineering technology, optimization of protein expression and  purification techniques, and mature of quality control systems all help to  realize large-scale production of recombinant antibodies, making it possible to  apply to the clinical practice. In terms of carrier-mediated delivery strategies  and others, although nano-carriers/adeno-associated virus (AAV) are also  promising candidates for delivering therapeutic proteins or genes across the BBB,  some issues still remain to be further investigated, including safety concerns  related to applied materials, large-scale production costs, quality control  standards, combination therapies with auxiliary delivery strategies like focused  ultrasound, etc.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1681-1698","","12","20","","Expert Opin Drug Deliv","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36945117","","","","*Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism; *Brain Diseases; AAV; BBB; Biological Transport; Brain/metabolism; Drug Delivery Systems/methods; Exosomes; Focused ultrasound; Humans; Liposomes; Macromolecular Substances/metabolism; Nanoparticles; Recombinant antibodies; Therapeutic protein delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These approaches  are used to overcome the blood brain barrier (BBB), but they have limitations  that necessitate the development of targeted delivery methods. Thus, recent  research has focused on spatiotemporally direct and indirect targeted delivery  methods because they decrease the effect on nontarget cells, thus minimizing side  effects and increasing the patient's quality of life. Methods that enable  therapeutics to be directly passed through the BBB to facilitate delivery to  target cells include the use of nanomedicine (nanoparticles and extracellular  vesicles), and magnetic field-mediated delivery. Nanoparticles are divided into  organic, inorganic types depending on their outer shell composition.  Extracellular vesicles consist of apoptotic bodies, microvesicles, and exosomes.  Magnetic field-mediated delivery methods include magnetic field-mediated  passive/actively-assisted navigation, magnetotactic bacteria, magnetic resonance  navigation, and magnetic nanobots-in developmental chronological order of when  they were developed. Indirect methods increase the BBB permeability, allowing  therapeutics to reach the CNS, and include chemical delivery and mechanical  delivery (focused ultrasound and LASER therapy). Chemical methods (chemical  permeation enhancers) include mannitol, a prevalent BBB permeabilizer, and other  chemicals-bradykinin and 1-O-pentylglycerol-to resolve the limitations of  mannitol. Focused ultrasound is in either high intensity or low intensity. LASER  therapies includes three types: laser interstitial therapy, photodynamic therapy,  and photobiomodulation therapy. The combination of direct and indirect methods is  not as common as their individual use but represents an area for further research  in the field. This review aims to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of  these methods, describe the combined use of direct and indirect deliveries, and  provide the future prospects of each targeted delivery method. We conclude that  the most promising method is the nose-to-CNS delivery of hybrid nanomedicine,  multiple combination of organic, inorganic nanoparticles and exosomes, via  magnetic resonance navigation following preconditioning treatment with  photobiomodulation therapy or focused ultrasound in low intensity as a strategy  for differentiating this review from others on targeted CNS delivery; however,  additional studies are needed to demonstrate the application of this approach in  more complex in vivo pathways.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1137096","","","17","","Front Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Won, An, Song, Im, You, Lee, Koo and Hwang.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37292158  PMCID: PMC10246499","","","","central nervous system; exosomes; magnetics; nanoparticles; targeted delivery; therapeutics; wounds and injuries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It  generates a precise thermal ablation in a specific nucleus or tract, such as  ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) or pallidothalamic tract (PTT). Despite a  single lesion improving parts of the PD symptoms, the feasibility and efficacy of  a stepwise dual-lesion in VIM and PTT are yet to be explored. METHODS: Three  patients with tremor-dominant PD (aged 60.7 ± 6.0 years) received dual-target  MRgFUS treatment with a series of primary and secondary outcome measures. The VIM  and PTT were navigated based on individual magnetic resonance imaging planning of  the brain. The primary outcome measures were the off-status Clinical Rating Scale  for Tremor and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III). The  secondary outcome measures included UPDRS I, II, IV, Hohen and Yahr score,  Neuropsychiatry Inventory, Quality of life in PD Rating Scale, Non-Motor Symptoms  Scale, and Clinical Global Impression. The baseline data were compared with those  acquired 1 day and 1 month following the treatment. RESULTS: The severity of  tremor and motor deficits represented by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor-part B  and UPDRS III were significantly improved (P < 0.05 by nonparametric Mann-Whitney  U tests) after dual-target ablations. The nonmotor symptoms investigated by UPDRS  II and Non-Motor Symptoms Scale also showed significant improvement at the 1-day  and 1-month follow-up. There was no adverse effect except temporary  procedure-related headache and dizziness during the treatment. CONCLUSIONS:  Stepwise dual-lesion targeting VIM and PTT is a safe and effective MRgFUS  therapeutic strategy for patients with PD.","2023-03","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e464-e470","","","171","","World Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

The GKRS had a partial effect on her postural tremor without side  effects, but there was no reduction of her kinetic tremor or improvement in her  quality of life (QoL). The patient subsequently underwent a MRgFUS thalamotomy,  which induced an immediate and marked reduction in both the postural and kinetic  tremor components, with minor complications (left upper lip hypesthesia,  dysmetria in her left hand, and slight gait ataxia). The MRgFUS-induced lesion  was centered more medially than the GKRS-induced lesion and extended more  posteriorly and inferiorly. The MRgFUS-induced lesion interrupted remaining  fibers of the dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRTT). The functional improvement  1-year post-MRgFUS was significant due to a marked reduction of the patient's  kinetic tremor. The QoL score (Quality of Life in Essential Tremor) improved by  88% and her Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor left hand score by 62%. The side  effects persisted but were minor, with no impact on her QoL. The explanation for  the superior efficacy of MRgFUS compared to GKRS in our patient could be due to  either a poor response to the GKRS or to a better localization of the MRgFUS  lesion with a more extensive interruption of DRTT fibers. In conclusion, MRgFUS  can be a valuable therapeutic option after unsatisfactory GKRS, especially  because MRgFUS has immediate clinical effectiveness, allowing intra-procedural  test lesions and possible readjustment of the target if necessary.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","380-386","","6","101","","Stereotact Funct Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 S.

However, continuously generating  oxygen cavitation nuclei, reducing the transient cavitation sound intensity  threshold, relieving hypoxia, and improving its controllability in the ablation  area still remains a significant challenge. Here, in this work, an Mn-coordinated  polyphthalocyanine sonocavitation agent (Mn-SCA) with large d-π-conjugated  network and atomic Mn-N sites is identified for the non-thermal sonocavitation  and sonodynamic therapy in the liver cancer ablation. In the tumor  microenvironment, the catalytical generation of oxygen assists cavitation  formation and generates microjets to ablate liver cancer tissue and relieve  hypoxia, this work reports for the first time to utilize the enzymatic properties  of Mn-SCA to lower the cavitation threshold in situ. Moreover, under pHIFU  irradiation, high reactive oxygen species (ROS) production can be achieved. The  two merits in liver cancer ablation are demonstrated by cell destruction and high  tumor inhibition efficiency. This work will help deepen the understanding of  cavitation ablation and the sonodynamic mechanisms related to the nanostructures  and guide the design of sonocavitation agents with high ROS production for solid  tumor ablation.","2023-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e2302744","","42","19","","Small","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 37322373","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; *Liver Neoplasms/therapy; Catalysis; Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Hypoxia; Oxygen; Reactive Oxygen Species; Tumor Microenvironment; cancer ablation; cavitation; histotripsy; pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound; reactive oxygen species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An increase in systemic dose elevates the risk  of drug side effects, which demands an alternative technique to increase the  unbound concentration of PHT in a region-specific manner. We present a  low-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) technique that locally enhances the  efficacy of PHT by transiently disrupting its binding to albumin. We first  identified the acoustic parameters that yielded the highest PHT unbinding from  albumin among evaluated parameter sets using equilibrium dialysis. Then, rats  with chronic mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) received four sessions of PHT  injection, each followed by 30 min of FUS delivered to the ictal region, across  2 weeks. Two additional groups of mTLE rats underwent the same procedure, but  without receiving PHT or FUS. Assessment of electrographic seizure activities  revealed that FUS accompanying administration of PHT effectively reduced the  number and mean duration of ictal events compared to other conditions, without  damaging brain tissue or the blood-brain barrier. Our results demonstrated that  the FUS technique enhanced the anti-epileptic efficacy of PHT in a chronic mTLE  rodent model by region-specific PPB disruption.","2023-03-13","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","4128","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

METHODS: We proposed AEMA, AEMAD, and AEMAD++ as  methods for estimating the angles of organs in ultrasound images, using RUDS and  a phantom to acquire 90-degree images of a kidney from the long-axis image to the  short-axis image as a data set. Six datasets were used, with five for preliminary  preparation and one for testing, while the initial position was shifted by 2 mm  in the contralateral axis direction. The test data set was evaluated by  estimating the angle using each method. RESULTS: The accuracy and processing  speed of angle estimation for AEMA, AEMAD, and AEMAD++ were 23.8% and 0.33 FPS  for AEMAD, 32.0% and 0.56 FPS for AEMAD, and 29.5% and 3.20 FPS for AEMAD++, with  tolerance of ± 2.5 degrees.

Acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI) was recently introduced to tackle this  issue, but its applicability and limitations were not clear. PURPOSE: The aim of  this study was to evaluate the performance of ARFI method in prediction of HIFU  focal location at the preoperative stage. METHODS: A point spread function (PSF)  localization method, which was borrowed from the ultrasound super resolution  field, was used to validate the core autocorrelation-based motion estimation  algorithm in the ARFI procedure. Accuracy of the ARFI method for estimating the  HIFU focus were tested with in vitro and ex vivo experiments with a clinically  equivalent HIFU system. Comparisons were made between the estimated focal  locations and those of the damaged area after the testing objects were cut open.  RESULTS: Results showed that the PSF localization was able to serve as a  validating method for motion detection only when the tissue displacement was  large. With the ARFI method, location of the HIFU focus could be accurately  predicted by a 2D motion map preoperatively, and the axial spatial errors were  less than 0.5 mm. However, the derived 2D motion maps can only be valuable when  the acoustic stimulation in ARFI were strong enough, which was probably due to  the fact that the HIFU focal locations were at large depths and the ultrasound  imaging signal had low signal to noise ratio. CONCLUSION: The ARFI method was  indeed an accurate technique for preoperatively predicting HIFU focus in vitro  and ex vivo. If clinical applications were to be considered, particularly in deep  tissues, efforts might need to be made to improve ability of the ultrasound  motion estimation technique.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","5449-5459","","9","50","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37345709","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Mechanical Phenomena; Acoustics; Ultrasonography; acoustic radiation force imaging; high-intensity focused ultrasound; motion estimation; surgery planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Safe  and efficient translation to humans requires estimating the acoustic attenuation  of the human skull. Nevertheless, there are no international guidelines for  estimating the impact of the skull bone. A tissue independent, arbitrary derating  was developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to take into account  tissue absorption (0.3 dB/cm-MHz) for diagnostic ultrasound. However, for the  case of transcranial ultrasound imaging, the FDA model does not take into account  the insertion loss induced by the skull bone, nor the absorption by brain tissue.  Therefore, the estimated absorption is overly conservative which could  potentially limit TUS applications if the same guidelines were to be adopted.  Here we propose a three-layer model including bone absorption to calculate the  maximum pressure transmission through the human skull for frequencies ranging  between 100 kHz and 1.5 MHz. The calculated pressure transmission decreases with  the frequency and the thickness of the bone, with peaks for each thickness  corresponding to a multiple of half the wavelength. The 95th percentile maximum  transmission was calculated over the accessible surface of 20 human skulls for 12  typical diameters of the ultrasound beam on the skull surface, and varies between  40% and 78%. To facilitate the safe adjustment of the acoustic pressure for short  ultrasound pulses, such as transcranial imaging or transcranial ultrasound  stimulation, a table summarizes the maximum pressure transmission for each  ultrasound beam diameter and each frequency.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","48-55","","1","16","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

While there is no cure for the condition, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) can allow users to control a device  with their mind, bypassing the paralyzed region. Non-invasive BCIs still have  high error rates, which is hypothesized to be reduced with concurrent targeted  neuromodulation. This study examines whether transcranial focused ultrasound  (tFUS) modulation can improve BCI outcomes, and what the underlying mechanism of  action might be through high-density electroencephalography (EEG)-based source  imaging (ESI) analyses. V5-targeted tFUS significantly reduced the error for the  BCI speller task. ESI analyses showed significantly increased theta activity in  the tFUS condition at both V5 and downstream the dorsal visual processing  pathway. Correlation analysis indicates that the dorsal processing pathway  connection was preserved during tFUS stimulation, whereas extraneous connections  were severed. These results suggest that V5-targeted tFUS' mechanism of action is  to raise the brain's feature-based attention to visual motion.","2023-09-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: bioRxiv Pages: 2023.09.04.556252 Publication Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology PMID: 37732253  PMCID: PMC10508752","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultrasonic and thermal modelling  conducted as part of the treatment planning process requires acoustic property  values for all constituent tissues, but the literature contains no data for the  human pancreas. PURPOSE: This study presents the first acoustic property  measurements of human pancreatic samples and provides examples of how these  properties impact a broad range of ultrasound therapies. METHODS: Data were  collected on human pancreatic tissue samples at physiological temperature from 23  consented patients in cooperation with a hospital pathology laboratory.  Propagation of ultrasound over the 2.1-4.5 MHz frequency range through samples of  various thicknesses and pathologies was measured using a set of custom-built  ultrasonic calipers, with the data processed to estimate sound speed and  attenuation. The results were used in acoustic and thermal simulations to  illustrate the impacts on extracorporeal ultrasound therapies for mild  hyperthermia, thermal ablation, and histotripsy implemented with a CE-marked  clinical system operating at 0.96 MHz. RESULTS: The mean sound speed and  attenuation coefficient values for human samples were well below the range of  values in the literature for non-human pancreata, while the human attenuation  power law exponents were substantially higher. The simulated impacts on  ultrasound mediated therapies for the pancreas indicated that when using the  human data instead of the literature average, there was a 30% reduction in median  temperature elevation in the treatment volume for mild hyperthermia and 43%  smaller volume within a 60°C contour for thermal ablation, all driven by  attenuation. By comparison, impacts on boiling and intrinsic threshold  histotripsy were minor, with peak pressures changing by less than 15% (positive)  and 1% (negative) as a consequence of the counteracting effects of attenuation  and sound speed. CONCLUSION: This study provides the most complete set of speed  of sound and attenuation data available for the human pancreas, and it reiterates  the importance of acoustic material properties in the planning and conduct of  ultrasound-mediated procedures, particularly thermal therapies.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","809-825","","2","51","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

Neuroimaging and lesion studies point to a locus of inhibitory  control in the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Electrophysiology studies  have implicated a downstream event-related potential from rIFG, the  fronto-central P300, as a putative neural marker of the success and timing of  inhibition over behavioral responses. However, it remains to be established  whether rIFG effectively drives inhibition and which aspect of P300 activity  uniquely indexes inhibitory control-ERP timing or amplitude. Here, we dissect the  connection between rIFG and P300 for inhibition by using transcranial-focused  ultrasound (tFUS) to target rIFG of human subjects while they performed a  Stop-Signal task. By applying tFUS simultaneously with different task events, we  found behavioral inhibition was improved, but only when applied to rIFG  simultaneously with a 'stop' signal. Improved inhibition through tFUS to rIFG was  indexed by faster stopping times that aligned with significantly shorter  N200/P300 onset latencies. In contrast, P300 amplitude was modulated during tFUS  across all groups without a paired change in behavior. Using tFUS, we provide  evidence for a causal connection between anatomy, behavior, and electrophysiology  underlying response inhibition.","2023-12-20","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","12","","Elife","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023, Fine et al.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38117053  PMCID: PMC10796145","","","","*Frontal Lobe/physiology; *Prefrontal Cortex/physiology; ERP; Evoked Potentials; Humans; Inhibition, Psychological; cognitive control; focused ultrasound; human; neuromodulation; neuroscience; response inhibition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Removal of cNF is limited to excision  or laser ablation with common post-operation complications and scarring. The  current case explores a new approach to removal or reduction of cNF by a  minimally invasive and pain-reduced treatment modality. A 40-year-old female  patient with numerous cNF across her body underwent a single treatment using a 20  MHz dermatologically focused ultrasound device on seven selected cNF on the upper  back. Each cNF was treated in a single session of 20-60 s without anesthesia due  to manageable pain. Only one minimal adverse reaction in the form of  dyspigmentation in a single treated tumor was noted from treatment or during the  healing of a thin scab that formed on each cNF a few days after treatment. At the  12-month follow-up, four out of seven treated cNF showed full remission, two  showed partial or significant reduction in tumor volume, while two did not  respond to treatment. The reason for the variability is not fully understood, but  speculations include difference in tissue content, e.g., due to tumor age. The  method is concluded to be a promising candidate for a new safe and minimally  invasive treatment that can potentially be used for single-session  removal/reduction of a large number of cNF. Further research should focus on  refining treatment parameters and strategies to enhance response predictability.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","194-201","","1","15","","Case Rep Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Author(s).

This is partly because, unlike some CNS  tumors, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) of DMG tumor vessels remains intact. The  BBB prevents the permeation of many molecular therapies into the brain  parenchyma, where the cancer cells reside. Focused ultrasound (FUS) with  microbubbles has recently emerged as an innovative and exciting technology that  non-invasively permeabilizes the BBB in a small focal region with millimeter  precision. In this review, current treatment methods and biological barriers to  treating DMGs are discussed. State-of-the-art FUS-mediated BBB opening is then  examined, with a focus on the effects of various ultrasound parameters and the  treatment of DMGs.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","412-421","","","365","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023.

The absence of a suitable pre-clinical animal model of  pancreatic cancer is a major limitation to biomedical device and therapeutic  development. Traditionally, pigs have proven to be ideal models, especially in  the context of designing human-sized instruments, perfecting surgical techniques  and optimizing clinical procedures for use in humans. However, pig studies have  typically focused on healthy tissue assessments and are limited to general safety  evaluations because of the inability to effectively model human tumors. METHODS:  Here, we establish an orthotopic porcine model of human pancreatic cancer using  RAG2/IL2RG double-knockout immunocompromised pigs and treat the tumors ex vivo  and in vivo with histotripsy. RESULTS: Using these animals, we describe the  successful engraftment of Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cell line tumors and  characterize their development. To illustrate the utility of these animals for  therapeutic development, we determine for the first time, the successful  targeting of in situ pancreatic tumors using histotripsy. Treatment with  histotripsy resulted in partial ablation in vivo and reduction in collagen  content in both in vivo tumor in pig pancreas and ex vivo patient tumor.  CONCLUSION: This study presents a first step toward establishing histotripsy as a  non-invasive treatment method for pancreatic cancer and exposes some of the  challenges of ultrasound guidance for histotripsy ablation in the pancreas.  Simultaneously, we introduce a highly robust model of pancreatic cancer in a  large mammal model that could be used to evaluate a variety biomedical devices  and therapeutic strategies.","2023-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2361-2370","","11","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

A particular challenge of treatment is  caused by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the relatively impermeable vasculature  of the brain. The BBB prevents large molecules from entering the brain  parenchyma. This protective characteristic of the BBB, however, also limits the  delivery of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of brain tumors. To address this  limitation, focused ultrasound (FUS) has been safely utilized to create transient  openings in the BBB, allowing various high molecular weight drugs access to the  brain. We performed a systematic review summarizing current research on treatment  of GBMs using FUS-mediated BBB openings in in vivo mouse and rat models. The  studies gathered here highlight how the treatment paradigm can allow for  increased brain and tumor perfusion of drugs including chemotherapeutics,  immunotherapeutics, gene therapeutics, nanoparticles, and more. Given the  promising results detailed here, the aim of this review is to detail the commonly  used parameters for FUS to open the BBB in rodent GBM models.","2022","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1072780","","","12","","Front Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Thombre, Mess, Kempski Leadingham, Kapoor, Hersh, Acord, Kaovasia, Theodore, Tyler and Manbachi.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36873300  PMCID: PMC9978816","","","","blood-brain barrier; chemotherapy; focused ultrasound; glioblastoma multiforme; immunotherapy; microbubble; neuro-oncology; non-invasive","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the lower cavitation threshold  of microbubbles can potentially yield off-target damage that the polydispersity  of clinical agent may further exacerbate. Here we investigate the use of a  monodisperse nanodroplet formulation for achieving antivascular effects in  tumors. We first develop stable low boiling point monodisperse lipid nanodroplets  and examine them as an alternative agent to mediate antivascular ultrasound. With  synchronous intravital imaging and ultrasound monitoring of focused  ultrasound-stimulated nanodroplets in tumor microvasculature, we show that  nanodroplets can trigger blood flow shutdown and do so with a sharper pressure  threshold and with fewer additional events than conventionally used microbubbles.  We further leverage the smaller size and prolonged pharmacokinetic profile of  nanodroplets to allow for potential passive accumulation in tumor tissue prior to  antivascular ultrasound, which may be a means by which to promote selective tumor  targeting. We find that vascular shutdown is accompanied by inertial cavitation  and complex-order sub- and ultraharmonic acoustic signatures, presenting an  opportunity for effective feedback control of antivascular ultrasound.","2024-01-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","410-427","","1","18","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38147452  PMCID: PMC10786165","","","","*Neoplasms; Acoustics; Humans; Intravital Microscopy; Microbubbles; Microvessels/diagnostic imaging; Ultrasonography; antivascular ultrasound; intravital imaging; monodisperse; nanodroplets; size control; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigated the changes of  cardiovascular neurotransmitter levels to indirectly evaluate the responses of  the autonomic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system under low-intensity  focused ultrasound stimulation (FUS) of the vagus nerve. METHODS: Cardiovascular  neurotransmitter levels of epinephrine (EPI), norepinephrine (NE), and  angiotensin II (ANGII) were measured and compared before and after the FUS in  seven spontaneously hypertensive rats; and were also measured and compared  between a target stimulation group (FUS, n = 6) and non-target stimulation group  (Control, n = 5) after stimulation to exclude the influence of potential  confounding factors. RESULTS: The t-test results showed that the levels of EPI,  NE, and ANGII were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) after stimulation compared  to before stimulation. Additionally, the levels of NE and EPI were significantly  lower (P < 0.05) in the FUS group than in the Control group after stimulation,  indicating that the activities of the sympathetic nervous system and  renin-angiotensin system of the vagus nerve might be inhibited by FUS of the  vagus nerve.

Because acoustic cavitation is the primary  mechanism of tissue disruption, histotripsy is distinct from the conventional  HIFU techniques resulting in hyperthermia and thermal injury. Phase I human  trials have shown the initial safety and efficacy of histotripsy in treating  patients with malignant liver tumors. In addition to tissue ablation, a promising  benefit of M-HIFU has been stimulating a local and systemic antitumor immune  response in preclinical models and potentially in the Phase I trial. Preclinical  studies combining systemic immune therapies appear promising, but clinical  studies of combinations have been complicated by systemic toxicities.  Consequently, combining M-HIFU with systemic immunotherapy has been demonstrated  in preclinical models and may be testing in future clinical studies. An  additional alternative is to combine intratumoral M-HIFU and immunotherapy using  microcatheter-placed devices to deliver both M-HIFU and immunotherapy  intratumorally. The promise of M-HIFU as a component of anti-cancer therapy is  promising, but as forms of HIFU are tested in preclinical and clinical studies,  investigators should report not only the parameters of the energy delivered but  also details of the preclinical models to enable analysis of the immune  responses. Ultimately, as clinical trials continue, clinical responses and immune  analysis of patients undergoing M-HIFU including forms of histotripsy will  provide opportunities to optimize clinical responses and to optimize application  and scheduling of M-HIFU in the context of the multi-modality care of the cancer  patient.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2263672","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37806666","","","","*Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Liver Neoplasms; Humans; Immunotherapy; Mechanical high-intensity focused ultrasound (M-HIFU); histotripsy; immunotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: CIP-LTSLs were prepared  using the thin-film hydration and extrusion method. Bone infection was  established by surgically implanting an orthopedic K-wire colonized with  methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain into rat's femurs. For bone  heating, ultrasound-guided HIFU exposures were performed to achieve a local  temperature of 40-42 °C (∼15 min) concurrently with intravenous injection of  CIP-LTSLs or CIP. CIP biodistribution was determined spectrophotometrically and  therapeutic efficacy was determined by bacteriological, histological and scanning  electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. RESULTS: CIP-LTSLs in the range of 183.5 nm ±  1.91 showed an encapsulation efficiency of >70% at 37 °C and a complete release  at ∼42 °C. The metal implantation method yielded medullary osteomyelitis  characterized by suppurative changes (bacterial and pus pockets) by day 10 in  bones and adjoining muscle tissues. HIFU heating significantly improved CIP  delivery from LTSLs in bones, resulting in a significant reduction in MRSA load  compared to HIFU and CIP alone groups. These were also verified by histology and  SEM, wherein a distinct reduction in S. aureus population in the infected metal  wires and tissues from the combinatorial therapy was noted.

The authors' goal was to retrospectively analyze the sonication  strategies, adverse effects, and clinical and imaging outcomes in patients with  SDR ≤ 0.4 treated for tremor using MRgFUS. METHODS: Clinical outcomes and adverse  effects were assessed at 3 and 12 months after MRgFUS. Outcomes and lesion  location, volume, and shape characteristics (elongation and eccentricity) were  compared between the SDR groups. RESULTS: A total of 102 consecutive patients  were included in the analysis, of whom 39 had SDRs ≤ 0.4. No patient was excluded  from treatment because of an LSDR, with the lowest being 0.22. Lesioning  temperatures (> 52°C) and therapeutic ablations were achieved in all patients.  There were no significant differences in clinical outcome, adverse effects,  lesion location, and volume between the high SDR group and the LSDR group.

Ultrasonic stimulation produces thermal and  mechanical effects, among others. Since transient receptor potential vanilloid 1  (TRPV1) could be activated at 42 °C, it is overexpressed in the M1 region of the  mouse motor cortex to sense the change of temperature upon being stimulated by  focused ultrasound. Whether the heat generated by ultrasonic stimulation could  activate TRPV1 in the M1 region and induce changes in electromyography (EMG)  signals collected from the mice's triceps was carefully verified. The position of  the focused ultrasound and the temperature of the tissue at the location of the  focused position were simulated using COMSOL software and verified via  experiments. For Neuro-2a cells with TRPV1 overexpression, 42 °C could activate  the TRPV1 and induce calcium influx. For mice with TRPV1 overexpression in the M1  region, tissue temperature of >42 °C in the M1 region induces an increased number  of cfos, suggesting that neurons with overexpressed TRPV1 in the M1 region can be  activated using focused ultrasound. Furthermore, when the temperature is >42 °C,  the peak-to-peak value of the EMG signal for mice with TRPV1 overexpression in  the M1 region was higher than that for mice without TRPV1 overexpression. The  immunohistochemical results showed that ultrasound was not harmful to the  stimulation site.

The four coagulation indexes, TNF-α, and D-dimer content of  experimental animals were measured before modeling and before and after  treatment, and the thrombolysis was assessed by ultrasound imaging. Finally, the  results were verified by pathology. Results and Discussion: Fluorescence  microscopy verified the successful preparation of targeted microbubbles.

FIB and D-dimer content were lower than those in Group I (all p <  0.05), and TNF-α content in Group IV was lower than that in Group I-III (all p <  0.05). Pairwise comparison before modeling and before treatment and after  treatment showed that, after treatment, the PT, APTT, and TT in Group II-IV were  longer than those before modeling (all p < 0.05). The contents of FIB and D-dimer  were lower than those before modeling and before treatment (all p < 0.05). The  content of TNF-α decreased significantly only in Group IV, but increased in the  other three groups. Targeted microbubbles combined with Low-power focused  ultrasound can reduce inflammation, significantly promote thrombolysis, and  provide new ideas and methods for the diagnosis and treatment of acute DVT.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1163405","","","11","","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Chen, Yang, Li, Xu, Zhao, Chen and Lu.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37008026  PMCID: PMC10060865","","","","acute deep vein thrombosis; low-power focused ultrasound; targeted microbubbles; thrombolysis; ultrasonic irradiation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also aimed at determining the miRNA-mRNA relationship and their  pathways in alcohol dependence-induced expression changes after focused  ultrasound therapy. We designed a case-control study for 100 days of observation  to investigate differences in gene expression in the short-term stimulation group  (STS) and long-term stimulation group (LTS) compared with the control sham group  (SG). The study was performed in our Experimental Research Laboratory. 24 male  high alcohol-preferring rats 63 to 79 days old, weighing 270 to 300 g, were  included in the experiment. LTS received 50-day LIFU and STS received 10-day LIFU  and 40-day sham stimulation, while the SG received 50-day sham stimulation. In  miRNA expression analysis, it was found that LIFU caused gene expression  differences in NAc. Significant differences were found between the groups for  gene expression. Compared to the SG, the expression of 454 genes in the NAc  region was changed in the STS while the expression of 382 genes was changed in  the LTS. In the LTS, the expression of 32 genes was changed in total compared to  STS. Our data suggest that LIFU targeted on NAc may assist in the treatment of  alcohol dependence, especially in the long term possibly through altering gene  expression. Our immunohistochemical studies verified that LIFU does not cause any  tissue damage. These findings may lead to new studies in investigating the  efficacy of LIFU for the treatment of alcohol dependence and also for other  psychiatric disorders.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1099-1116","","2","60","","Mol Neurobiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

In the present study, a new  sonothrombolysis method is proposed for treating embolus without the use of  thrombolytic drugs. Our proposed method involves (a) generating a spatially  localised acoustic radiation force in a blood vessel against the blood flow to  trap moving blood clots (i.e., generation of an acoustic net), (b) producing  acoustic cavitation to mechanically destroy the trapped embolus, and (c)  acoustically monitoring the trapping and mechanical fractionation processes.  Three different ultrasound transducers with different purposes were employed in  the proposed method: (1) 1-MHz dual focused ultrasound (dFUS) transducers for  capturing moving blood clots, (2) a 2-MHz High Intensity Focused Ultrasound  (HIFU) source for fractionating blood clots and (3) a passive acoustic emission  detector with broad bandwidth (10 kHz to 20 MHz) for receiving and analysing  acoustic waves scattered from a trapped embolus and acoustic cavitation. To  demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, in vitro experiments with an  optically transparent blood vessel-mimicking phantom filled with a blood  mimicking fluid and a blood clot (1.2 to 5 mm in diameter) were performed with  varying the dFUS and HIFU exposure conditions under various flow conditions (from  1.77 to 6.19 cm/s). A high-speed camera was used to observe the production of  acoustic fields, acoustic cavitation formation and blood clot fragmentation  within a blood vessel by the proposed method. Numerical simulations of acoustic  and temperature fields generated under a given exposure condition were also  conducted to further interpret experimental results on the proposed  sonothrombolysis. Our results clearly showed that fringe pattern-like acoustic  pressure fields (fringe width of 1 mm) produced in a blood vessel by the dFUS  captured an embolus (1.2 to 5 mm in diameter) at the flow velocity up to  6.19 cm/s. This was likely to be due to the greater magnitude of the dFUS-induced  acoustic radiation force exerted on an embolus in the opposite direction to the  flow in a blood vessel than that of the drag force produced by the flow. The  acoustically trapped embolus was then mechanically destructed into small pieces  of debris (18 to 60 μm sized residual fragments) by the HIFU-induced strong  cavitation without damaging the blood vessel walls. We also observed that  acoustic emissions emitted from a blood clot captured by the dFUS and cavitation  produced by the HIFU were clearly distinguished in the frequency domain. Taken  together, these results can suggest that our proposed sonothrombolysis method  could be used as a promising tool for treating thrombosis and embolism through  capturing and destroying blood clots effectively.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","106435","","","96","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Focal ablation using ultrasound-guided  high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has demonstrated promising short and  medium-term oncological outcomes. Advancements in HIFU therapy such as the  introduction of tissue change monitoring (TCM) aim to further improve treatment  efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between intraoperative TCM  during HIFU focal therapy for localized prostate cancer and oncological outcomes  12 mo afterward. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy consecutive men at a  single institution with prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled. Men with  prior treatment, metastases, or pelvic radiation were excluded to obtain a final  cohort of 55 men. INTERVENTION: All men underwent HIFU focal therapy followed by  magnetic resonance (MR)-fusion biopsy 12 mo later. Tissue change was quantified  intraoperatively by measuring the backscatter of ultrasound waves during  ablation. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Gleason grade group (GG)  ≥2 cancer on postablation biopsy was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes  included GG ≥1 cancer, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS)  scores ≥3, and evidence of tissue destruction on post-treatment magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI). A Student's t - test analysis was performed to evaluate  the mean TCM scores and efficacy of ablation measured by histopathology.  Multivariate logistic regression was also performed to identify the odds of  residual cancer for each unit increase in the TCM score. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS:  A lower mean TCM score within the region of the tumor (0.70 vs 0.97, p = 0.02)  was associated with the presence of persistent GG ≥2 cancer after HIFU treatment.  Adjusting for initial prostate-specific antigen, PI-RADS score, Gleason GG,  positive cores, and age, each incremental increase of TCM was associated with an  89% reduction in the odds (odds ratio: 0.11, confidence interval: 0.01-0.97) of  having residual GG ≥2 cancer on postablation biopsy. Men with higher mean TCM  scores (0.99 vs 0.72, p = 0.02) at the time of treatment were less likely to have  abnormal MRI (PI-RADS ≥3) at 12 mo postoperatively. Cases with high TCM scores  also had greater tissue destruction measured on MRI and fewer visible lesions on  postablation MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue change measured using TCM values during  focal HIFU of the prostate was associated with histopathology and radiological  outcomes 12 mo after the procedure. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we looked at  how well ultrasound changes of the prostate during focal high-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU) therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer predict patient  outcomes. We found that greater tissue change measured by the HIFU device was  associated with less residual cancer at 1 yr. This tool should be used to ensure  optimal ablation of the cancer and may improve focal therapy outcomes in the  future.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","584-591","","4","9","","Eur Urol Focus","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

PURPOSE: This study presents the development and evaluation of a  tumor-bearing tissue phantom model for testing magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI)-guided FUS (MRgFUS) ablation protocols and equipment based on MR  thermometry. METHODS: Normal tissue was mimicked by a pure agar gel, while the  tumor simulator was differentiated from the surrounding material by including  silicon dioxide. The phantom was characterized in terms of acoustic, thermal, and  MRI properties. US, MRI, and computed tomography (CT) images of the phantom were  acquired to assess the contrast between the two compartments. The phantom's  response to thermal heating was investigated by performing high power sonications  with a 2.4 MHz single element spherically focused ultrasonic transducer in a 3T  MRI scanner. RESULTS: The estimated phantom properties fall within the range of  literature-reported values of soft tissues. The inclusion of silicon dioxide in  the tumor material offered excellent tumor visualization in US, MRI, and CT. MR  thermometry revealed temperature elevations in the phantom to ablation levels and  clear evidence of larger heat accumulation within the tumor owing to the  inclusion of silicon dioxide. CONCLUSION: Overall, the study findings suggest  that the proposed tumor phantom model constitutes a simple and inexpensive tool  for preclinical MRgFUS ablation studies, and potentially other image-guided  thermal ablation applications upon minimal modifications.","2023-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","5956-5968","","10","50","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

Approximately 20-50% of women with myomas experience a variety of symptoms such as vaginal  bleeding, abdominal pain, pelvic pain and pressure, and urological problems,  possibly interfering with fertility and pregnancy. Although surgery remains the  standard treatment option for fibroids, non-invasive therapeutic options, such as  high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), have emerged over the last dec ade.  During HIFU, ultrasound is focused on the target tissue causing coagulation  necrosis. HIFU has, meanwhile, become an established method for treating uterine  fibroids in many countries. Clinical data have shown that it effectively  alleviates fibroid-related symptoms and reduces fibroid size with a very low rate  of side effects. However, there is a lack of data on how this treatment affects  laboratory parameters and structural features of uterine tissue. As our center is  the only one in German-speaking countries where ultrasound-guided HIFU technology  is currently established, the aim of this prospective, monocentric, single-arm  trial is not only to evaluate the safety and efficacy of local US-guided HIFU in  symptomatic uterine fibroid patients according to GCP standards but also to  explore its effects on blood parameters and the structural integrity of uterine  tissue using elastographic methods.","2023-09-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","18","12","","J Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37762868  PMCID: PMC10531700","","","","US and MRI elastographic methods; high-intensity focused ultrasound; structural integrity of uterine tissue; symptomatic uterine fibroids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of T cells from focused  ultrasound ablation in HIFU-mediated immunomodulation. METHODS: Sixty H(22)  tumor-bearing mice were treated by either HIFU or sham-HIFU, and 30 naïve  syngeneic mice served as controls. All mice were euthanized on day 14 after HIFU  and splenic T cell suspensions were obtained in each group. Using an adoptive  cell transfer model, a total of 1 × 10(6) T cells from HIFU treated-mice were  intravenously injected into each syngeneic H(22) tumor-bearing mouse twice on day  3 and 4, followed by the sacrifice for immunological assessments at 14 days after  the adoptive transfer. RESULTS: T cells from HIFU-treated mice could  significantly enhance the cytotoxicity of CTLs (p < 0.001), with a significant  increase of TNF-α (p < 0.001) and IFN-γ secretion (p < 0.001).

Transcranial focused ultrasound (FU) is an  emerging neuromodulation approach that combines noninvasiveness with relatively  sharp focus, even in deep brain regions. It has numerous advantages such as high  precision and good safety in neuromodulation, allowing for modulation of both  peripheral and central nervous systems. To ensure accurate treatment targeting in  FU neuromodulation, a magnetic resonance acoustic radiation force imaging  (MR-ARFI) sequence is crucial for the visualization of the focal point.  Currently, the commonly used 2D Spin Echo ARFI (2D SE-ARFI) sequence suffers from  the long acquisition time, while the echo planar imaging ARFI (EPI-ARFI) sequence  with a shorter acquisition time is vulnerable to the magnetic field  inhomogeneities. To address these problems, we proposed a spatiotemporal-encoded  acoustic radiation force imaging sequence (i.e., SE-SPEN-ARFI, shortened to  SPEN-ARFI) in this study. The displacement at the focal spot obtained was highly  consistent with that of the SE-ARFI sequence. Our research shows that SPEN-ARFI  allows for rapid image acquisition and has less image distortions even under  great field inhomogeneities. Therefore, a SPEN-ARFI sequence is a practical  alternative for the treatment planning in ultrasound neuromodulation.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1184629","","","17","","Front Hum Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Qi, Sun, Zhu, Kong, Roberts, Dong, Huang, He, Xing and Gong.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37180550  PMCID: PMC10172656","","","","SPatiotemporal-ENcoded (SPEN); acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI); focused ultrasound (FU) neuromodulation; frequency-swept (chirp) pulse; magnetic resonance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monosynaptic  H-reflex of the sciatic nerve, polysynaptic flexor reflex of the sural nerve, and  withdrawal reflex tested with a hot plate were measured before, during, and after  tsFUS. RESULTS: tsFUS reversibly suppresses the H-reflex in a spinal segment-,  acoustic pressure- and pulse-repetition frequency (PRF)-dependent manner. tsFUS  with high PRF augments the degree of homosynaptic depression of the H-reflex  observed with paired stimuli. It suppresses the windup of components of the  flexor reflex associated with slower, C-afferent, but not faster, A- afferent  fibers. Finally, it increases the latency of the withdrawal reflex. tsFUS does  not elicit neuronal loss in the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides  evidence that tsFUS reversibly suppresses spinal reflexes and suggests that tsFUS  could be a safe and effective strategy for spinal cord neuromodulation in  disorders associated with hyperreflexia, including spasticity after spinal cord  injury and painful syndromes.","2023-08-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","S1094-7159(23)00649-9","","","","","Neuromodulation","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Efforts have been made to overcome these barriers by drug targeting the  tumor microenvironment. Results so far are promising, but without clinical  impact. Our aim was to investigate whether ultrasound and microbubbles could  improve the uptake and therapeutic response of conventional chemotherapy.  METHODS: Orthotopic pancreatic tumors growing in mice were treated with  commercially available FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and  calcium folinate) and SonoVue microbubbles combined with focused ultrasound.  Tumor uptake of platinum (Pt) was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass  spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and tumor volumes were measured by ultrasound imaging.  DISCUSSION: Uptake of Pt, the active ingredient of oxaliplatin, was significantly  increased after ultrasound treatment of orthotopic PDAC tumors. Multiple  injections with FOLFIRONOX increased the amount of Pt in tumors. However, the  enhanced accumulation did not improve therapeutic response. Increased uptake of  Pt confirms that ultrasound and microbubbles have potential in clinical practice  with existing drugs. CONCLUSION: The lack of therapeutic response, despite  increased uptake in tumor tissue, emphasizes the importance of studying how to  overcome stromal barriers.","2023-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1275-1287","","5","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We  retrospectively analyzed 40 PAS patients between April 2017 and October 2021. All  the patients received one session of HIFU treatment. Regular follow-up was done  after HIFU treatment until normal menstruation returned and placental tissue  disappeared. The patient's reproductive-related outcomes were obtained through  telephone interviews. RESULTS: The median follow-up time for the 40 patients was  30.50 (15.75-44.00) months and the mean placental tissue elimination time was  45.29 ± 33.32 days. The mean duration of bloody lochia was 13.43 ± 10.01 days,  with no incidences of severe bleeding. Notably, Linear regression analysis showed  that the residual placenta volume before HIFU was a factor affecting the duration  of bloody lochia after HIFU (R2 = 0.284, B = 0.062, P = 0.000). The normal  menstrual return time was 58.71 ± 31.14 days. One (2.50%) patient developed an  infection. Two (5.00%) patients were subjected to ultrasound-guided suction  curettage for persistent vaginal discharge for more than one month without  infection. Notably, 7 of the 18 patients who expressed reproductive plans became  pregnant during the 4 to 53 months of follow-up without placental abnormalities.  The remaining 11 patients were on contraceptives. CONCLUSIONS: Single HIFU is an  effective treatment option for managing PAS.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: GL261 or  LL/2-Luc2 cells were cultured and implanted into the brains of C57BL/6 mice.  Histotripsy (1-cycle pulses, 5 Hz PRF, 30 MPa-P) was performed using a 1 MHz  transducer for five different dosages for each cell line: 5, 20 or 200 pulses per  location (PPL) at a single treatment point, or 5 or 10-20 PPL at multiple  treatment points. MRI, bioluminescence imaging and histology were used to assess  tumor ablation and treatment effects within 4-6 h post-treatment. RESULTS: All  treatment groups resulted in a reduction of BLI intensity for the LL/2-Luc2  tumors, with significant signal reductions for the multi-point groups. The  average pre-/post-treatment BLI flux (photons/s, ×10(8)) for the different  treatment groups were: 4.39/2.19 (5 PPL single-point), 5.49/1.80 (20 PPL  single-point), 3.86/1.73 (200 PPL single-point), 2.44/1.11 (5 PPL multi-point)  and 5.85/0.80 (10 PPL multi-point). MRI and H&E staining showed increased tumor  damage and hemorrhagic effects with increasing histotripsy dose for both GL261  and LL/2-Luc2 tumors, but the increase in tumor damage was diminished beyond  10-20 PPL for single-point treatments and outweighed by increased hemorrhage. In  general, hemorrhage was confined to be within 1 mm of the treatment boundary for  all groups.

Due to the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus  (HBV) infection in China, the incidence of HCC in China is high, and liver  cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis also brings great challenges to treatment.  This paper reviewed the latest research progress on minimally invasive treatments  for HCC, including percutaneous thermal ablation and new nonthermal ablation  techniques, and introduced the principles, advantages, and clinical applications  of various therapeutic methods in detail. DATA SOURCES: The data of treatments  for HCC were systematically collected from the PubMed, ScienceDirect, American  Chemical Society and Web of Science databases published in English, using  ""minimally invasive"" and ""hepatocellular carcinoma"" or ""liver cancer"" as the  keywords. RESULTS: Percutaneous thermal ablation is still a first-line strategy  for the minimally invasive treatment of HCC. The effect of microwave ablation  (MWA) on downgrading treatment before liver transplantation is better than that  of radiofrequency ablation (RFA), while RFA is more widely used in the clinical  practice. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is mainly used for the  palliative treatment of advanced liver cancer. Electrochemotherapy (ECT) delivers  chemotherapeutic drugs to the target cells while reducing the blood supply around  HCC. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) uses a microsecond-pulsed electric field  that induces apoptosis and necrosis and triggers a systemic immune response. The  nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF) has achieved a good response in the  ablation of mice with HCC, but it has not been reported in China for the  treatment of human HCC. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of minimally invasive treatments  provide a sufficient survival advantage for HCC patients. Nonthermal ablation  will lead to a new wave with its unique advantage of antitumor recurrence and  metastasis.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","54-63","","1","22","","Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China.

In addition to being limited by the size and location of the  stones, its efficacy is influenced by several factors. Despite the advancement of  other surgical techniques, SWL could maintain its position with new improvements.  Our objective is to review the existing literature on the latest advances in the  extracorporeal treatment of lithiasis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-systematic  literature review was carried out from 2017 to 2023 to obtain 26 articles on  three different emerging technologies in extracorporeal lithotripsy: Burst Wave  Lithotripsy (BWL), Histotripsy, and Microbubble Lithotripsy (ML). RESULTS: The  BWL uses sinusoidal bursts of US waves delivered at lower and higher frequencies  than conventional SWL. Its mechanism of action generates a higher quality  fragmentation (fine fragments) instead of generating tensile stresses for stone  fracture resulting in larger fragments, as in traditional SWL. Studies in pigs  and humans have shown effective fragmentation with a good safety profile. Based  on High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) technology, histotripsy fragments  tissue through cavitation. Good in vitro results have been shown, but the  formation of microbubbles between the stone and ultrasound waves hinders the  progress of this technique. Microbubble Lithotripsy (ML) combines microbubbles  and ultrasound for safe and effective stone fragmentation. In vitro and pig  results are promising. This technique can help optimize treatments and reduce  energy levels. CONCLUSIONS: Technological innovation is not only being applied to  endourological techniques, but also to ESWL. New techniques such as BWL,  histotripsy and ML are promising, with good results in the research phase.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","105-110","","1","48","","Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)","","","","","","","","spa","Copyright © 2023.

Symptoms can include discomfort, and they can become problematic, particularly  when they enlarge, resulting in many referrals for biopsies, with fibroadenomas  accounting for 30-75% of the cases. Diagnosis is based on triple assessment that  involves a clinical examination, ultrasound imaging, and mammography, as well as  core needle biopsies. Current management includes observation for 6-12 months,  with the indication of definitive surgery, in cases that are older than 35 years  or with fibroadenoma persistence. Serious adverse effects of surgery might  include nipple areolar distortion, scarring, and damage to the breast tissue, as  well as the risks associated with surgery and anesthesia, making it a  non-feasible option. METHODS: A literature search was performed on the databases  Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, and Ovid for English language papers  published between January 1, 2000, and March 17, 2021. A structured protocol was  employed to devise a comprehensive search strategy with keywords and Boolean  operators defined by the research question. The keywords used for the search were  ""HIFU"", ""High Intensity Focused Ultrasound,"" ""Fibroadenoma,"" ""Breast,"" ""Lesion.""  This review was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Recently, a  thermal ablative technique, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), was found  to be a safe, noninvasive, and technically successful alternative, having  displayed promising outcomes in reducing the volume of fibroadenomas, pain  experienced by patients, and the length of hospitalization. Quality of life  improvement was also evidenced, exhibited by the disappearance of symptoms, and  enhanced physical activity post-intervention, in addition to patients'  satisfaction with the cosmetic results and future recommendation of the procedure  to other patients. CONCLUSION: Overall, HIFU is a well-tolerated treatment  associated, with low risk of complications, that can potentially include  erythema, skin discoloration, and bruising with the majority of these  self-resolving shortly after the procedure.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","279-288","","4","18","","Breast Care (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 S.

METHODS: PubMed and  Scopus databases were searched according to the PRISMA guidelines to identify  studies from 2002 to November 2022. Eligible studies were selected based on  criteria such as experimental study type, the use of HIFU therapy as a treatment  for localised breast cancer with objective clinical evaluation, i.e., clinical,  radiological, and pathological outcomes. Nine studies were included in this  study. RESULTS: Two randomised controlled trials and seven non-randomised  clinical trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The percentage of patients who  achieved complete (100%) coagulation necrosis varied from 17% to 100% across all  studies. Eight of the nine studies followed the treat-and-resect protocol in  which HIFU-ablated tumours were surgically resected for pathological evaluation.  Most breast cancers were single, solitary, and palpable breast tumours.  Haematoxylin and eosin stains used for histopathological evaluation showed  evidence of coagulation necrosis. Radiological evaluation by MRI showed an  absence of contrast enhancement in the HIFU-treated tumour and 1.5 to 2 cm of  normal breast tissue, with a thin peripheral rim of enhancement indicative of  coagulation necrosis. All studies did not report severe complications, i.e.,  haemorrhage and infection. Common complications related to HIFU ablation were  local mammary oedema, pain, tenderness, and mild to moderate burns. Only one  third-degree burn was reported. Generally, the cosmetic outcome was good. The  five-year disease-free survival rate was 95%, as reported in two RCTs.  CONCLUSIONS: HIFU ablation can induce tumour coagulation necrosis in localised  breast cancer, with a favourable safety profile and cosmetic outcome. However,  there is variable evidence of complete coagulation necrosis in the HIFU-treated  tumour. Histopathological evidence of coagulation necrosis has been inconsistent,  and there is no reliable radiological modality to assess coagulation necrosis  confidently. Further exploration is needed to establish the accurate ablation  margin with a reliable radiological modality for treatment and follow-up. HIFU  therapy is currently limited to single, palpable breast tumours. More extensive  and randomised clinical trials are needed to evaluate HIFU therapy for breast  cancer, especially where the tumour is left in situ.","2023-08-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","15","13","","Diagnostics (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37568958  PMCID: PMC10417478","","","","HIFU; breast cancer; necrosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There was also one case for each of the  following: adenoid cystic carcinoma of the jaw, malignant melanoma, caecum MiNEN,  a brain and an extracranial meningioma, tongue carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma,  osteosarcoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the most  complex and the largest analysis of prior published data within the time frame of  our methods. These data open up new perspectives of this intricate, dynamic, and  challenging domain of sternum metastases. Awareness is a mandatory factor since  the patients may have a complex multidisciplinary medical and/or surgical  background or they are admitted for the first time with this condition; thus, the  convolute puzzle will start from this newly detected sternal lump.

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We sought to  demonstrate that tFUS can selectively and accurately target and modulate deep  brain structures in humans important for emotional functioning as well as  learning and memory. We hypothesized that tFUS would result in significant  longitudinal changes in perfusion in the targeted brain region as well as  selective modulation of BOLD activity and BOLD-based functional connectivity of  the target region. METHODS: In this study, we collected MRI before,  simultaneously during, and after tFUS of two deep brain structures on different  days in sixteen healthy adults each serving as their own control. Using  longitudinal arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI and simultaneous blood oxygen level  dependent (BOLD) functional MRI, we found changes in cerebral perfusion, regional  brain activity and functional connectivity specific to the targeted regions of  the amygdala and entorhinal cortex (ErC). RESULTS: tFUS selectively increased  perfusion in the targeted brain region and not in the contralateral homolog or  either bilateral control region. Additionally, tFUS directly affected BOLD  activity in a target specific fashion without engaging auditory cortex in any  analysis. Finally, tFUS resulted in selective modulation of the targeted  functional network connectivity. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that tFUS can  selectively modulate perfusion, neural activity and connectivity in deep brain  structures and connected networks. Lack of auditory cortex findings suggests that  the mechanism of tFUS action is not due to auditory or acoustic startle response  but rather a direct neuromodulatory process. Our findings suggest that tFUS has  the potential for future application as a novel therapy in a wide range of  neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with subcortical pathology.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1120410","","","17","","Front Neural Circuits","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Kuhn, Spivak, Dang, Becerra, Halavi, Rotstein, Rosenberg, Hiller, Swenson, Cvijanovic, Dang, Sun, Kronemyer, Berlow, Revett, Suthana, Monti  and Bookheimer.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37091318  PMCID: PMC10114286","","","","*Brain Mapping/methods; *Reflex, Startle; Adult; Brain/diagnostic imaging/physiology; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Perfusion; amygdala; brain perfusion; entorhina cortex; functional connectivity; transcranial focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both HIFU and LIFU approaches have been investigated for reducing seizure  activity in DRE, and additional FUS applications include disrupting the  blood-brain barrier in the presence of microbubbles for targeted-drug delivery to  the seizure foci. Here, we review the preclinical and clinical studies that have  used FUS to treat seizures. Additionally, we review effective FUS parameters and  consider limitations and future directions of FUS with respect to the treatment  of DRE. While detailed studies to optimize FUS applications are ongoing, FUS has  established itself as a potential noninvasive alternative for the treatment of  DRE and other neurological disorders.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1301956","","","14","","Front Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Cornelssen, Finlinson, Rolston and Wilcox.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38162441  PMCID: PMC10756913","","","","animal models of epilepsy; clinical epilepsy research; drug-resistant epilepsy; focused ultrasound; high-intensity focused ultrasound; low-intensity focused ultrasound; seizures; therapeutic ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: To measure the spatiotemporal  kinetics of local andabscopal responses to histotripsy, C57BL/6 mice bearing  bilateral flank B16 melanoma or Hepa1-6 hepatocellular carcinoma tumors were  treated with unilateral sham or partial histotripsy. Treated and contralateral  untreated (abscopal) tumors were analyzed using multicolor immunofluorescence,  digital spatial profiling, RNA sequencing (RNASeq), and flow cytometry. RESULTS:  Unilateral histotripsy triggered abscopal tumor growth inhibition. Within the  ablation zone, early high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) release and  necroptosis were accompanied by immunogenic cell death transcriptional responses  in tumor cells and innate immune activation transcriptional responses in  infiltrating myeloid and natural killer (NK) cells. Delayed CD8+ T cell  intratumoral infiltration was spatiotemporally aligned with cancer cell features  of ferroptosis; this effect was enhanced by CTLA-4 blockade and recapitulated in  vitro when tumor-draining lymph node CD8+ T cells were co-cultured with tumor  cells. Inoculation with cell-free tumor fractions generated by histotripsy but  not radiation or freeze/thaw conferred partial protection from tumor challenge.  DISCUSSION: We propose that histotripsy may evoke local necroptotic immunogenic  cell death, priming systemic adaptive immune responses and abscopal ferroptotic  cancer cell death.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1012799","","","14","","Front Immunol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Pepple, Guy, McGinnis, Felsted, Song, Hubbard, Worlikar, Garavaglia, Dib, Chao, Boyle, Olszewski, Xu, Ganguly and Cho.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36756111  PMCID: PMC9900174","","","","*Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/therapy; *Liver Neoplasms; Animals; Cell Death; Immunity; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; ablation; ferroptosis; histotripsy; immunity; necroptosis; tumor; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All  methods utilize short, high-amplitude pulses of focused ultrasound delivered at a  low duty cycle, and all involve excitation of violent bubble activity and  acoustic streaming at the focus to fractionate tissue down to the subcellular  level. The main differences are in pulse duration, which spans microseconds to  milliseconds, and ultrasound waveform shape and corresponding peak acoustic  pressures required to achieve the desired type of bubble activity. In addition,  most types of histotripsy rely on the presence of high-amplitude shocks that  develop in the pressure profile at the focus due to nonlinear propagation  effects. Those requirements, in turn, dictate aspects of the instrument design,  both in terms of driving electronics, transducer dimensions and intensity  limitations at surface, shape (primarily, the F-number) and frequency. The  combination of the optimized instrumentation and the bio-effects from bubble  activity and streaming on different tissues, lead to target clinical applications  for each histotripsy method. Here, the differences and similarities in the  physical mechanisms and resulting bioeffects of each method are reviewed and tied  to optimal instrumentation and clinical applications.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2233720","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37460101  PMCID: PMC10479943","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; High intensity focused ultrasound; Phantoms, Imaging; Transducers; Ultrasonography; boiling histotripsy; cavitation; histotripsy; nonlinear propagation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
