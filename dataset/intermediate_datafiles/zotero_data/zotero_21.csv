METHODS: A three-dimensional stack-of-stars echo-planar imaging sequence combining echo-planar imaging and radial sampling with golden angle spacing was implemented at 3T for proton resonance frequency-shift temperature imaging. The sequence acquires a 188x188x43 image matrix with 1.5x1.5x2.75 mm(3) spatial resolution. Temperature maps were reconstructed using sensitivity encoding (SENSE) image reconstruction followed by the image domain hybrid method, and using the k-space hybrid method. In vivo temperature maps were acquired without heating to measure temperature precision in the brain, and in a phantom during high-intensity focused ultrasound sonication. RESULTS: In vivo temperature standard deviation was less than 1 degrees C at dynamic scan times down to 0.75 s. For a given frame rate, scanning at a minimum repetition time (TR) with minimum acceleration yielded the lowest standard deviation. With frame rates around 3 s, the scan was tolerant to a small number of receive coils, and temperature standard deviation was 48% higher than a standard two-dimensional Fourier transform temperature mapping scan, but provided whole-brain coverage. Phantom temperature maps with no visible aliasing were produced for dynamic scan times as short as 0.38 s. k-Space hybrid reconstructions were more tolerant to acceleration. CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional stack-of-stars echo-planar imaging temperature mapping provides volumetric brain coverage and fine spatiotemporal resolution. Magn Reson Med 79:2003-2013, 2018.

In the first generation of block copolymer stabilized perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions, perfluoropentane (PFP) was used as the droplet forming compound. Although manifesting excellent therapeutic and ultrasound imaging properties, PFP nanoemulsions were unstable at storage, difficult to handle, and underwent hard to control phenomenon of irreversible droplet-to-bubble transition upon injection. To solve the above problems, perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE) was used as a core forming compound in the second generation of block copolymer stabilized perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions. PFCE nanodroplets manifest both ultrasound and fluorine (19F) MR contrast properties, which allows using multimodal imaging and 19F MR spectroscopy for monitoring nanodroplet pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. In the present paper, acoustic, imaging, and therapeutic properties of unloaded and paclitaxel (PTX) loaded PFCE nanoemulsions are reported. As manifested by the 19F MR spectroscopy, PFCE nanodroplets are long circulating, with about 50% of the injected dose remaining in circulation 2h after the systemic injection. Sonication with 1-MHz therapeutic ultrasound triggered reversible droplet-to-bubble transition in PFCE nanoemulsions. Microbubbles formed by acoustic vaporization of nanodroplets underwent stable cavitation. The nanodroplet size (200nm to 350nm depending on a type of the shell and conditions of emulsification) as well as long residence in circulation favored their passive accumulation in tumor tissue that was confirmed by ultrasonography. In the breast and pancreatic cancer animal models, ultrasound-mediated therapy with paclitaxel-loaded PFCE nanoemulsions showed excellent therapeutic properties characterized by tumor regression and suppression of metastasis. Anticipated mechanisms of the observed effects are discussed.","2011-07","2021-02-23 04:19:15","2021-02-23T04:19:15Z","","4–15","","1","153","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 Publisher: Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Worldwide, these four diseases account for more than 20 million patients. In addition, aging greatly increases the risk of neurodegenerative disease. Although great progress has been made in recent years toward understanding of these diseases, few effective treatments and no cures are currently available. This is mainly due to the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that allows only 5% of the 7000 small-molecule drugs available to treat only a tiny fraction of these diseases. On the other hand, safe and localized opening of the BBB has been proven to present a significant challenge. Of the methods used for BBB disruption shown to be effective, Focused Ultrasound (FUS), in conjunction with microbubbles, is the only technique that can induce localized BBB opening noninvasively and regionally. FUS may thus have a huge impact in trans-BBB brain drug delivery. The primary objective in this paper is to elucidate the interactions between ultrasound, microbubbles and the local microenvironment during BBB opening with FUS, which are responsible for inducing the BBB disruption. The mechanism of the BBB opening in vivo is monitored through the MRI and passive cavitation detection (PCD), and the safety of BBB disruption is assessed using H&E histology at distinct pressures, pulse lengths and microbubble diameters. It is hereby shown that the BBB can be disrupted safely and transiently under specific acoustic pressures (under 0.45 MPa) and microbubble (diameter under 8 μm) conditions.","2012-06","2021-02-23 04:18:44","2021-02-23T04:18:44Z","","1332–45","","7","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 7 PMID: 22201586","","","","Animals; Blood-Brain Barrier; Blood-Brain Barrier: drug effects; Blood-Brain Barrier: metabolism; Blood-Brain Barrier: ultrasonography; Brain; Brain: drug effects; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Delivery Systems: methods; Humans; Microbubbles; Microbubbles: therapeutic use; Ultrasonics; Ultrasonics: methods; grant; microbubble diameter; safety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS Transcranial magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery offers a potential noninvasive alternative to surgical resection. The method combines a hemispherical phased-array transducer and patient-specific treatment planning based on acoustic models with feedback control based on magnetic resonance temperature imaging to overcome the effects of the cranium and allow for controlled and precise thermal ablation in the brain. In initial trials in 3 glioblastoma patients, multiple focused ultrasound exposures were applied up to the maximum acoustic power available. Offline analysis of the magnetic resonance temperature images evaluated the temperature changes at the focus and brain surface. RESULTS We found that it was possible to focus an ultrasound beam transcranially into the brain and to visualize the heating with magnetic resonance temperature imaging. Although we were limited by the device power available at the time and thus seemed to not achieve thermal coagulation, extrapolation of the temperature measurements at the focus and on the brain surface suggests that thermal ablation will be possible with this device without overheating the brain surface, with some possible limitation on the treatment envelope. CONCLUSION Although significant hurdles remain, these findings are a major step forward in producing a completely noninvasive alternative to surgical resection for brain disorders.","2010-02","2021-02-23 03:18:27","2021-02-23T03:18:27Z","","323–32; discussion 332","","2","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 PMID: 20087132","","","","ablation; acoustics; devices; medical; patient care planning; sonication; surgery specialty; temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spatial resolution and position of the sampling grid were considered using experimental and simulated data for two different types of high intensity focused ultrasound heating trajectories (a single point and a 4-mm circle) with maximum measured temperature and thermal dose volume as the metrics. It is demonstrated that measurement accuracy is related to the curvature of the temperature distribution, where regions with larger spatial second derivatives require higher resolution. The location of the sampling grid relative temperature distribution has a significant effect on the measured values.

The algorithm generates images from undersampled data by iteratively minimizing a cost function. The unique challenges of using an iterative constrained reconstruction technique to generate real-time images were addressed.

For a set of three heating experiments on in vivo canine muscle tissue, the maximum reduction factor achieved was 3 while keeping the temperature RMSE below 1.0 degrees C. At these reduction factors, the TCR algorithm underpredicted the thermal dose by an average of 6% for the ex vivo data and 28% for the in vivo data.

Systemically administered DNA-BPN delivered through the BBB with FUS led to dose-dependent transgene expression only in the FUS-treated region that was evident as early as 24h post administration and lasted for at least 28days. In the FUS-treated region ∼42% of all cells, including neurons and astrocytes, were transfected, while less than 6% were transfected in the contralateral non-FUS treated hemisphere. Importantly, this was achieved without any sign of toxicity or astrocyte activation.

However, they are constrained within the intravascular space due to their micron-size diameters, limiting the delivery effect at or near the microvessels. In the present study, acoustically-activated nanodroplets were used as a new class of contrast agents to mediate FUS-induced BBB opening in order to study the feasibility of utilizing these nanoscale phase-shift particles for targeted drug delivery in the brain. Significant dextran delivery was achieved in the mouse hippocampus using nanodroplets at clinically relevant pressures. Passive cavitation detection was used in the attempt to establish a correlation between the amount of dextran delivered in the brain and the acoustic emission recorded during sonication. Conventional microbubbles with the same lipid shell composition and perfluorobutane core as the nanodroplets were also used to compare the efficiency of an FUS-induced dextran delivery. It was found that nanodroplets had a higher BBB opening pressure threshold but a lower stable cavitation threshold than microbubbles, suggesting that contrast agent-dependent acoustic emission monitoring was needed. A more homogeneous dextran delivery within the targeted hippocampus was achieved using nanodroplets without inducing inertial cavitation or compromising safety.

Accelerated MR temperature imaging methods have been developed that undersample k-space and leverage signal correlations over time to suppress the resulting undersampling artifacts. However, in transcranial MRgFUS treatments, the water bath surrounding the skull creates signal variations that do not follow those correlations, leading to temperature errors in the brain due to signal aliasing. METHODS: To eliminate temperature errors due to the water bath, a spatially-segmented iterative reconstruction method was developed. The method fits a k-space hybrid signal model to reconstruct temperature changes in the brain, and a conventional MR signal model in the water bath. It was evaluated using single-channel 2DFT Cartesian, golden angle radial, and spiral data from gel phantom heating, and in vivo 8-channel 2DFT data from a FUS thalamotomy. Water bath signal intensity in phantom heating images was scaled between 0-100% to investigate its effect on temperature error. Temperature reconstructions of retrospectively undersampled data were performed using the spatially-segmented method, and compared to conventional whole-image k-space hybrid (phantom) and SENSE (in vivo) reconstructions. RESULTS: At 100% water bath signal intensity, 3 x-undersampled spatially-segmented temperature reconstruction error was nearly 5-fold lower than the whole-image k-space hybrid method. Temperature root-mean square error in the hot spot was reduced on average by 27 x (2DFT), 5 x (radial), and 12 x (spiral) using the proposed method. It reduced in vivo error 2 x in the brain for all acceleration factors, and between 2 x and 3 x in the temperature hot spot for 2-4 x undersampling compared to SENSE. CONCLUSIONS: Separate reconstruction of brain and water bath signals enables accelerated MR temperature imaging during MRgFUS procedures with low errors due to undersampling using Cartesian and non-Cartesian trajectories. The spatially-segmented method benefits from multiple coils, and reconstructs temperature with lower error compared to measurements from SENSE-reconstructed images. The acceleration can be applied to increase volumetric coverage and spatiotemporal resolution.","2017","2021-02-23 02:33:06","2021-02-23T02:33:06Z","","13","","","5","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 28560040","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, there exists only one non-invasive methodology with the potential to solve these problems: selective blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening using micro-bubble enhanced focused ultrasound. We have recently developed a single-element 500-kHz spherical transducer ultrasound setup for targeted BBB opening in the non-human primate that does not require simultaneous MRI monitoring. So far, however, the targeting accuracy that can be achieved with this system has not been quantified systematically. In this paper, the accuracy of this system was tested by targeting caudate nucleus and putamen of the basal ganglia in two macaque monkeys. The average lateral targeting error of the system was approximately 2.5 mm while the axial targeting error, i.e., along the ultrasound path, was approximately 1.5 mm. We have also developed a real-time treatment monitoring technique based on cavitation spectral analysis. This technique also allowed for delineation of a safe and reliable acoustic parameter window for BBB opening. In summary, the targeting accuracy of the system was deemed to be suitable to reliably open the BBB in specific sub-structures of the basal ganglia even in the absence of MRI-based verification of opening volume and position. This establishes the method and the system as a potentially highly useful tool for brain drug delivery.","2014","2021-02-23 02:23:21","2021-02-23T02:23:21Z","","e84310","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 2 PMID: 24505248","","","","Animals; Basal Ganglia; Blood-Brain Barrier; Contrast Media; Doppler; Drug Delivery Systems; Female; Haplorhini; Humans; Male; Transcranial; Ultrasonography; diagnostic imaging; methods; pharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Magnetic resonance imaging-guided thermal ablation via laser or other methods has been evaluated as a minimally invasive alternative to these techniques in the brain. Focused ultrasound (FUS) offers a noninvasive method of thermal ablation; however, skull heating limits currently available technology to ablation at regions distant from the skull bone. Here, the authors evaluated a method that circumvents this problem by combining the FUS exposures with injected microbubble-based ultrasound contrast agent. These microbubbles concentrate the ultrasound-induced effects on the vasculature, enabling an ablation method that does not cause significant heating of the brain or skull. METHODS In 29 rats, a 525-kHz FUS transducer was used to ablate tissue structures at the skull base that were centered on or adjacent to the optic tract or chiasm. Low-intensity, low-duty-cycle ultrasound exposures (sonications) were applied for 5 minutes after intravenous injection of an ultrasound contrast agent (Definity, Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc.). Using histological analysis and visual evoked potential (VEP) measurements, the authors determined whether structural or functional damage was induced in the optic tract or chiasm. RESULTS Overall, while the sonications produced a well-defined lesion in the gray matter targets, the adjacent tract and chiasm had comparatively little or no damage. No significant changes (p \textgreater 0.05) were found in the magnitude or latency of the VEP recordings, either immediately after sonication or at later times up to 4 weeks after sonication, and no delayed effects were evident in the histological features of the optic nerve and retina. CONCLUSIONS This technique, which selectively targets the intravascular microbubbles, appears to be a promising method of noninvasively producing sharply demarcated lesions in deep brain structures while preserving function in adjacent nerves. Because of low vascularity–and thus a low microbubble concentration–some large white matter tracts appear to have some natural resistance to this type of ablation compared with gray matter. While future work is needed to develop methods of monitoring the procedure and establishing its safety at deep brain targets, the technique does appear to be a potential solution that allows FUS ablation of deep brain targets while sparing adjacent nerve structures.","2013-11","2021-02-23 02:16:36","2021-02-23T02:16:36Z","","1208–20","","5","119","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 5 PMID: 24010975","","","","EAP-FUS144","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, it was shown that it is possible to ablate tissues without depositing thermal energy by driving intravenously administered microbubbles to inertial cavitation using low-duty-cycle burst sonications. A recent study demonstrated that this ablation method could ablate tissue volumes near the skull base in nonhuman primates without thermally damaging the nearby bone. However, blood-brain disruption was observed in the prefocal region, and in some cases, this region contained small areas of tissue damage. The objective of this study was to analyze the experimental model with simulations and to interpret the cause of these effects. METHODS: The authors simulated prior experiments where nonthermal ablation was performed in the brain in anesthetized rhesus macaques using a 220 kHz clinical prototype transcranial MRI-guided FUS system. Low-duty-cycle sonications were applied at deep brain targets with the ultrasound contrast agent Definity. For simulations, a 3D pseudospectral finite difference time domain tool was used. The effects of shear mode conversion, focal steering, skull aberrations, nonlinear propagation, and the presence of skull base on the pressure field were investigated using acoustic and elastic wave propagation models. RESULTS: The simulation results were in agreement with the experimental findings in the prefocal region. In the postfocal region, however, side lobes were predicted by the simulations, but no effects were evident in the experiments. The main beam was not affected by the different simulated scenarios except for a shift of about 1 mm in peak position due to skull aberrations. However, the authors observed differences in the volume, amplitude, and distribution of the side lobes. In the experiments, a single element passive cavitation detector was used to measure the inertial cavitation threshold and to determine the pressure amplitude to use for ablation. Simulations of the detector's acoustic field suggest that its maximum sensitivity was in the lower part of the main beam, which may have led to excessive exposure levels in the experiments that may have contributed to damage in the prefocal area. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that case-specific full wave simulations before the procedure can be useful to predict the focal and the prefocal side lobes and the extent of the resulting bioeffects produced by nonthermal ablation. Such simulations can also be used to optimally position passive cavitation detectors. The disagreement between the simulations and the experiments in the postfocal region may have been due to shielding of the ultrasound field due to microbubble activity in the focal region. Future efforts should include the effects of microbubble activity and vascularization on the pressure field.","2016-02","2021-02-23 02:16:32","2021-02-23T02:16:32Z","","870–882","","2","43","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 2 PMID: 26843248","","","","Ablation Techniques; Animals; Biological; Brain; Computer-Assisted; Macaca mulatta; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models; Nonlinear Dynamics; Skull; Surgery; methods; surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Noninvasive ultrasound thermometry based on a 2-D speckle tracking algorithm was examined in this study. Here, a commercial ultrasound scanner, a customized co-linear array transducer, and a controlling PC system were used to generate mild hyperthermia. Because the co-linear array transducer is capable of both therapy and imaging at widely separated frequencies, RF image frames were acquired during therapeutic insonation and then exported for off-line analysis. For in vivo studies in a mouse model, before temperature estimation, motion correction was applied between a reference RF frame and subsequent RF frames. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments were examined; in the in vitro and in vivo studies, the average temperature error had a standard deviation of 0.7&#x00B0;C and 0.8&#x00B0;C, respectively. The application of motion correction improved the accuracy of temperature estimation, where the error range was -1.9 to 4.5&#x00B0;C without correction compared with -1.1 to 1.0&#x00B0;C following correction.

METHODS MR examinations were performed before and 2 days after the ultrasound functional neurosurgical treatment to visualize the targets on T2-weighted images and determine their coordinates. Thirty consecutive targets were reconstructed: 18 were in the central lateral nucleus of the medial thalamus (central lateral thalamotomies against neurogenic pain), 1 in the centrum medianum thalamic nucleus (centrum medianum thalamotomy against essential tremor), 10 on the pallido-thalamic tract (pallido-thalamic tractotomies against Parkinson's disease), and 1 on the cerebello-thalamic tract (cerebello-thalamic tractotomy against essential tremor). We describe a method for reconstruction of the lesion coordinates on post-treatment MR images, which were compared with the desired atlas target coordinates. We also calculated the accuracy of the intra-operative target placement, thus allowing to determine the global, planning, and device accuracies. We also estimated the target lesion volume. RESULTS We found mean absolute global targeting accuracies of 0.44 mm for the medio-lateral dimension (standard deviation 0.35 mm), 0.38 mm for the antero-posterior dimension (standard deviation 0.33 mm), and 0.66 mm for the dorso-ventral dimension (standard deviation 0.37 mm). Out of the 90 measured coordinates, 83 (92.2%) were inside the millimeter domain. The mean three-dimensional (3D) global accuracy was 0.99 mm (standard deviation 0.39 mm). The mean target volumes, reconstructed from surface measurements on 3D T1 series, were 68.5 mm(3) (standard deviation 39.7 mm(3)), and 68.9 mm(3) (standard deviation 40 mm(3)) using an ellipsoidal approximation. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates a high accuracy of the MR-guided focused ultrasound technique. This high accuracy is due not only to the device qualities but also to the possibility for the operator to perform on-going real-time monitoring of the lesioning process. A precise method for determination of targeting accuracy is an essential component and basic requirement of the functional neurosurgical activity, allowing an on-going control of the performed therapeutic work indispensable for any target efficiency analysis and the maintenance of a low risk profile.","2013","2021-02-22 23:24:41","2021-02-22T23:24:41Z","","3","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 24761224","","","","Anterior commissure; Posterior commissure; Stereotactic atlas; Targeting accuracy; Thalamo-ventricular border; Transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the efficiency is relatively low. Our previous study showed that human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) in culture were attracted by an external magnetic field. In vivo, enhanced brain retention was observed near a magnet mounted on the skull in a rat model of traumatic brain injury, where BBBD also occurs. The goal of the current study was to determine whether magnetic attraction of SPION-loaded hNPCs would also enhance their retention in the brain after FUS-mediated BBBD. A small animal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided FUS system operating at 1.5 MHz was used to treat rats ( approximately 120 g) without tissue damage or hemorrhage. Evidence of successful BBBD was validated with both radiologic enhancement of gadolinium on postsonication TI MRI and whole brain section visualization of Evans blue dye. The procedure was then combined with the application of a powerful magnet to the head directly after intravenous injection of the hNPCs. Validation of cells within the brain was performed by staining with Perls' Prussian blue for iron and by immunohistochemistry with a human-specific antigen. By injecting equal numbers of iron oxide (SPIONs) and noniron oxide nanoparticles-loaded hNPCs, each labeled with a different fluorophore, we found significantly greater numbers of SPIONs-loaded cells retained in the brain at the site of BBBD as compared to noniron loaded cells. This result was most pronounced in regions of the brain closest to the skull (dorsal cortex) in proximity to the magnet surface. A more powerful magnet and a Halbach magnetic array resulted in more effective retention of SPION-labeled cells in even deeper brain regions such as the striatum and ventral cortex. There, up to 90% of hNPCs observed contained SPIONs compared to 60% to 70% with the less powerful magnet. Fewer cells were observed at 24 h posttreatment compared to 2 h (primarily in the dorsal cortex).

In this study, we repeatedly opened the BBB in the caudate and putamen regions of the basal ganglia of 4 NHP using FUS with systemically-administered MB over 4-20 months. We assessed the safety of the FUS with MB procedure using MRI to detect edema or hemorrhaging in the brain. Contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI sequences showed a 98% success rate for openings in the targeted regions. T2-weighted and SWI sequences indicated a lack edema in the majority of the cases. We investigated potential neurological effects of the FUS with MB procedure through quantitative cognitive testing of' visual, cognitive, motivational, and motor function using a random dot motion task with reward magnitude bias presented on a touchpanel display. Reaction times during the task significantly increased on the day of the FUS with MB procedure. This increase returned to baseline within 4-5 days after the procedure. Visual motion discrimination thresholds were unaffected. Our results indicate FUS with MB can be a safe method for repeated opening of the BBB at the basal ganglia in NHP for up to 20 months without any long-term negative physiological or neurological effects with the parameters used.","2015-01","2021-02-22 23:17:59","2021-02-22T23:17:59Z","","e0130860","","5","10","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 5 PMID: 25945493","","","","primates; repeated; safety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically targeting visceral fat deposits with MR-HIFU could offer an effective therapy for reversing the development of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. METHODS Overweight rats received either MR-HIFU of visceral fat, sham treatment, no treatment, or ex vivo temperature calibration. Conventional MR thermometry methods are not effective in fat tissue. Therefore, the T2 of fat was used to estimate heating in adipose tissue. RESULTS HIFU treated rats lost 7.5% of their body weight 10 days after HIFU, compared with 1.9% weight loss in sham animals (P = 0.008) and 1.3% weight increase in untreated animals (P = 0.004). Additionally, the abdominal fat volume in treated animals decreased by 8.2 mL 7 days after treatment (P = 0.002). The T2 of fat at 1.5 Tesla increased by 3.3 ms per °C. The fat T2 was 103.3 ms before HIFU, but increased to 128.7 ms (P = 0.0005) after HIFU at 70 watts for 16 s and to 131.9 ms (P = 0.0005) after HIFU at 100 watts for 16 s. CONCLUSION These experiments demonstrate that MR-HIFU of visceral fat could provide a safe, effective, and noninvasive weight loss therapy for combating obesity and the subsequent medical complications.

By use of a 250-kHz focused ultrasound transducer, the area was sonicated in pulsed mode (tone-burst duration of 1 ms, duty cycle of 50%) for 300 ms. The acoustic intensity at the focal target was varied up to a spatial peak pulse-average intensity (Isppa) of 14.3 W/cm(2). Sonication of SM1 elicited electromyographic responses from the contralateral hind leg, whereas stimulation of V1 generated electroencephalographic potentials. These responses were detected only above a certain acoustic intensity, and the threshold intensity, as well as the degree of responses, varied among sheep. Post-sonication animal behavior was normal, but minor microhemorrhages were observed from the V1 areas exposed to highly repetitive sonication (every second for \textgreater/=500 times for electroencephalographic measurements, Isppa = 6.6-10.5 W/cm(2), mechanical index = 0.9-1.2).

The hybrid PRF/T(1) sequence is a standard radiofrequency spoiled gradient echo sequence executed in a dynamic mode with two flip angles alternating every time frame. The PRF information is extracted every time frame using the image phase in the standard approach, and the T(1) information is extracted every two time frames using a variable flip angle approach.

In this study, we further demonstrate that this technique could be used for characterization of tumors and/or identification of cellular masses of unknown origin due to the release of multiple protein and nucleic acid biomarkers in cells in culture, mice and patients. We sonicated colon (LS174T) and prostate (LNCaP) cancer cell lines in culture at a low frequency of 1 MHz and show that there were several-fold changes in multiple protein and microRNA (miRNA) abundance with treatment at various intensities and time. This release was dependent on the duration and intensity of the sonication for both cell lines. Significant increased release in biomarkers was also observed following tumor sonication in living mice bearing subcutaneous LS174T cell line xenografts (for proteins and nucleic acids) and in an experimental LS174T liver tumor model (for proteins only). Finally, we demonstrated this methodology of multiple biomarker release in patients undergoing ablation of uterine fibroids using MR guided high intensity focused ultrasound. Two protein biomarkers significantly increased in the plasma after the ultrasound treatment in 21 samples tested. This proof that ultrasound-amplification method works in soft tissue tumor models together with biomarker multiplexing, could allow for an effective non-invasive method for identification, characterization and localization of incidental lesions, cancer and other disease. Pre-treatment quantification of the biomarkers, allows for individualization of quantitative comparisons. This individualization of normal marker levels in this method allows for specificity of the biomarker-increase to each patient, tumor or organ being studied.","2018","2021-02-22 23:08:34","2021-02-22T23:08:34Z","","e0194268","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 3 PMID: 29547636","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fluorescence imaging of brain slices found that IN administration followed by FUS sonication achieved significantly higher delivery than IN administration only, while pre-treatment by FUS sonication followed by IN administration was not significantly different from IN administration only. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a promising neurotrophic factor for the treatment of many central nervous system diseases, was delivered by IN followed by FUS to demonstrate the feasibility of this technique and compared with the established FUS technique where drugs are injected intravenously. Immunohistochemistry staining of BDNF revealed that FUS-enhanced IN delivery achieved similar locally enhanced delivery as the established FUS technique.

FUS was delivered in a train of pulses at low acoustic energy, far below the cavitation threshold, to the animal's somatomotor and visual areas, as guided by anatomical and functional information from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The temporary alterations in the brain function affected by the sonication were characterized by both electrophysiological recordings and functional brain mapping achieved through the use of functional MRI (fMRI). The modulatory effects were bimodal, whereby the brain activity could either be stimulated or selectively suppressed. Histological analysis of the excised brain tissue after the sonication demonstrated that the FUS did not elicit any tissue damages. Unlike transcranial magnetic stimulation, FUS can be applied to deep structures in the brain with greater spatial precision. Transient modulation of brain function using image-guided and anatomically-targeted FUS would enable the investigation of functional connectivity between brain regions and will eventually lead to a better understanding of localized brain functions.

We evaluated real-time acoustic feedback and aimed to understand whether cavitation contributed to the heating and the lesion formation. In four macaques, we sonicated thalamic targets at acoustic powers of 34-560 W (896-7590 J). Tissue effects evaluated with MRI and histology were compared to MRI-based temperature and thermal dose measurements, acoustic emissions recorded during the experiments, and acoustic and thermal simulations. Peak temperatures ranged from 46 to 57 degrees C, and lesions were produced in 5/8 sonicated targets. A linear relationship was observed between the applied acoustic energy and both the focal and brain surface heating. Thermal dose thresholds were 15-50 cumulative equivalent minutes at 43 degrees C, similar to prior studies at higher frequencies. Histology was also consistent with earlier studies of thermal effects in the brain. The system successfully controlled the power level and maintained a low level of cavitation activity. Increased acoustic emissions observed in 3/4 animals occurred when the focal temperature rise exceeded approximately 16 degrees C. Thresholds for thermally-significant subharmonic and wideband emissions were 129 and 140 W, respectively, corresponding to estimated pressure amplitudes of 2.1 and 2.2 MPa. Simulated focal heating was consistent with the measurements for sonications without thermally-significant acoustic emissions; otherwise it was consistently lower than the measurements. Overall, these results suggest that the lesions were produced by thermal mechanisms. The detected acoustic emissions, however, and their association with heating suggest that cavitation might have contributed to the focal heating. Compared to earlier work with a 670 kHz TcMRgFUS system, the brain surface heating was substantially reduced and the focal heating was higher with this 230 kHz system, suggesting that a reduced frequency can increase the treatment envelope for TcMRgFUS and potentially reduce the risk of skull heating.","2016-11","2021-02-22 22:47:18","2021-02-22T22:47:18Z","","7664–7687","","21","61","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 21 PMID: 27740941","","","","Animals; Brain; FUS-Hyperthermia; Female; Induced; Macaca mulatta; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models; Skull; Theoretical; Ultrasonography; diagnostic imaging; instrumentation; methods; pathology; surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility and safety of MR-guided FUS surgery in the setting of a previously implanted DBS system. METHODS: Three preclinical experiments were designed to test feasibility and safety. Hydrogels were implanted with an electrode, and FUS lesions were targeted adjacently. Cadavers were implanted with a thalamic electrode, and FUS lesions were targeted in the contralateral thalamus. Finally, DBS systems were implanted in swine, and FUS lesioning was targeted to the contralateral thalamus, MRI was used to assess the treatments, and histological analyses were performed at 2 days and at 1 month. RESULTS: In gel experiments and cadavers, FUS resulted in target heating to 29-32 degrees C without any heating at the electrode. In animal experiments, there were no FUS-related MRI signal changes near the electrode. Histological analysis showed typical FUS lesions with no evidence of damage surrounding the electrode tracts.

The latency of the stimulation was estimated by measuring the time taken from the onset of the stimulation of the appropriate brain motor area to the corresponding tail motor response. The brain area showing elevated glucose uptake from the PET image was much smaller (56+/-10% in diameter, 24+/-6% in length) than the size of the acoustic focus, which is conventionally defined by the full-width at half-maximum of the acoustic intensity field. The spatial dimension of the FUS-mediated neuromodulatory area was more localized, approximated to be full-width at 90%-maximum of the acoustic intensity field. In addition, the time delay of motor responses elicited by the FUS sonication was 171+/-63 (SD) ms from the onset of sonication. When compared with latencies of other nonultrasonic neurostimulation techniques, the longer time delay associated with FUS-mediated motor responses is suggestive of the nonelectrical modes of neuromodulation, making it a distinctive brain stimulation method.","2014-05","2021-02-22 22:39:08","2021-02-22T22:39:08Z","","475–479","","7","25","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 7 PMID: 24384503","","","","Acoustic Stimulation; Acoustics; Animals; Brain; Brain Mapping; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Male; Movement; Positron-Emission Tomography; Rats; Reaction Time; Sonication; Sprague-Dawley; Tail; physiology; radiation effects; radionuclide imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focused ultrasound (FUS) in conjunction with microbubbles has been shown to open the BBB noninvasively, locally, and transiently to allow large molecules diffusion. Neurturin (NTN), a member of the glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family, has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective and regenerative effects on dopaminergic neurons in vivo using invasive drug delivery methods. The brain's ascending nigrostriatal pathway is severely damaged in Parkinson's disease (PD), and therefore the substantia nigra (SN) and striatal caudoputamen (CP) were selected as the target areas. The objective of the study was to investigate whether safe and efficient NTN delivery can be achieved through FUS-induced BBB opening via intravenous administration, and thus trigger the neuroregeneration cascade in the nigrostriatal pathway. After the optimization of FUS parameters and target locations in the murine brain, NTN bioavailability and downstream signaling were detected and characterized through immunostaining. FUS significantly enhanced the delivery of NTN compared with the direct injection technique, whereas triggering of the signaling cascade was detected downstream to the neuronal nuclei. These findings thus indicate the potential of the FUS method to mediate transport of proteins through the blood-brain barrier in a PD animal model.","2015-01","2021-02-22 22:37:55","2021-02-22T22:37:55Z","","611–22","","4","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 4 PMID: 25586140","","","","NTN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method, model predictive filtering, combines temperature predictions from a preidentified thermal model with undersampled k-space data to create temperature maps in near real time. The model predictive filtering algorithm was implemented in three ways: using retrospectively undersampled k-space data from a fully sampled two-dimensional gradient echo (GRE) sequence (reduction factors R = 2.7 to R = 7.1), using actually undersampled data from a two-dimensional GRE sequence (R = 4.8), and using actually undersampled data from a three-dimensional GRE sequence (R = 12.1). Thirty-nine high-intensity focused ultrasound heating experiments were performed under MRI monitoring to test the model predictive filtering technique against the current gold standard for MR temperature mapping, the proton resonance frequency shift method. For both of the two-dimensional implementations, the average error over the five hottest voxels from the hottest time frame remained between +/-0.8 degrees C and the temperature root mean square error over a 24 x 7 x 3 x 25-voxel region of interest remained below 0.35 degrees C. The largest errors for the three-dimensional implementation were slightly worse: -1.4 degrees C for the mean error of the five hottest voxels and 0.61 degrees C for the temperature root mean square error.","2010","2021-02-22 22:28:39","2021-02-22T22:28:39Z","","1269–1279","","5","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 5 ISBN: 1522-2594 (Electronic)$\backslash$r0740-3194 (Linking) PMID: 20432298","","","","EAP-FUS019; Modeling; Proton resonance frequency shift; Reconstruction; Temperature; Undersample","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design goals for the system included the ability to treat the majority of tumor locations, to increase the MR image's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) throughout the treatment volume and to provide adequate comfort for the patient. METHODS In order to treat the majority of the breast volume, the device was designed such that the treated breast is suspended in a 17-cm diameter treatment cylinder. A laterally shooting 1-MHz, 256-element phased-array ultrasound transducer with flexible positioning is mounted outside the treatment cylinder. This configuration achieves a reduced water volume to minimize RF coil loading effects, to position the coils closer to the breast for increased signal sensitivity, and to reduce the MR image noise associated with using water as the coupling fluid. This design uses an 11-channel phased-array RF coil that is placed on the outer surface of the cylinder surrounding the breast. Mechanical positioning of the transducer and electronic steering of the focal spot enable placement of the ultrasound focus at arbitrary locations throughout the suspended breast. The treatment platform allows the patient to lie prone in a face-down position. The system was tested for comfort with 18 normal volunteers and SNR capabilities in one normal volunteer and for heating accuracy and stability in homogeneous phantom and inhomogeneous ex vivo porcine tissue. RESULTS There was a 61% increase in mean relative SNR achieved in a homogeneous phantom using the 11-channel RF coil when compared to using only a single-loop coil around the chest wall. The repeatability of the system's energy delivery in a single location was excellent, with less than 3% variability between repeated temperature measurements at the same location. The execution of a continuously sonicated, predefined 48-point, 8-min trajectory path resulted in an ablation volume of 8.17 cm(3), with one standard deviation of 0.35 cm(3) between inhomogeneous ex vivo tissue samples. Comfort testing resulted in negligible side effects for all volunteers. CONCLUSIONS The initial results suggest that this new device will potentially be suitable for MRgHIFU treatment in a wide range of breast sizes and tumor locations.","2012-03","2021-02-22 22:24:46","2021-02-22T22:24:46Z","","1552","","3","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 3 PMID: 22380387","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pulsed focused ultrasound was applied to the last digit of human hands for 10 s using combinations of acoustic frequencies (350 and 650 kHz), tone-burst-durations (0.1 and 1.0 ms), pulse repetition frequencies (10 and 100 Hz) with 1% duty cycle, and acoustic intensities (3–100 mW/cm2), divided into two ambient temperatures (20 and 40°C). On insonification, volunteers reported cooling, warming, vibrotactile sensations, and mild nociception, while there was no actual increase to the skin temperature. Continuous insonification, in contrast to pulsed insonification, failed to elicit these sensations. Our results suggest that pulsed ultrasound temporarily modifies the activity of the sensory receptors on the skin, and casts future utility in dermatological applications as well as in the field of haptic device interfaces.","2014","2021-02-22 22:22:58","2021-02-22T22:22:58Z","","167–174","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2","","","","focused ultrasound; peripheral nervous system; tactile; temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS & METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model was constructed. Cost-effectiveness was calculated in terms of US$ per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) over 5 years. Two types of costs were calculated: direct costs only, and the sum of direct and indirect (productivity) costs. Women in the hypothetical cohort were assessed for treatment type eligibility, were treated based on eligibility, and experienced adequate or inadequate symptom relief. Additional treatment (myomectomy) occurred for inadequate symptom relief or recurrence. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate uncertainty in the model parameters. RESULTS: In the base case, myomectomy, MRgFUS and UAE had the following combinations of mean cost and mean QALYs, respectively: US$15,459, 3.957; US$15,274, 3.953; and US$18,653, 3.943. When incorporating productivity costs, MRgFUS incurred a mean cost of US$21,232; myomectomy US$22,599; and UAE US$22,819. Using probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and excluding productivity costs, myomectomy was cost effective at almost every decision threshold. Using PSA and incorporating productivity costs, myomectomy was cost effective at decision thresholds above US$105,000/QALY; MRgFUS was cost effective between US$30,000 and US$105,000/QALY; and UAE was cost effective below US$30,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: Myomectomy, MRgFUS, and UAE were similarly effective in terms of QALYs gained. Depending on assumptions about costs and willingness to pay for additional QALYs, all three treatments can be deemed cost effective in a 5-year time frame.","2014-09","2021-02-22 22:22:44","2021-02-22T22:22:44Z","","503–514","","5","3","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 5 PMID: 24878319","","","","Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Support Techniques; EAP-FUS165; Embolization; Female; High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; Humans; Interventional; Leiomyoma; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Therapeutic; Treatment Outcome; United States; Uterine Myomectomy; Uterus; economics; methods; surgery; therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study used healthcare claims for several million individuals with healthcare coverage from employers in the MarketScan Database for the period 2003-2010. UF patients aged 25-54 on their first UF procedure (index) date with 366-day baseline experience, 366-day follow-up period, continuous health plan enrollment during baseline and follow-up, and absence of any baseline UF procedures were included in the final sample.

UF-related cost was defined as difference in mean cost between study cohorts and propensity-score-matched control cohorts without UF. Multivariate adjustment of cost outcomes was conducted using generalized linear models. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 14,426 patients (MRgFUS = 14; UAE = 4,092; myomectomy = 10,320) with a higher percent of older patients in MRgFUS cohort (71% vs. 50% vs. 12% in age-group 45-54, P \textless 0.001).

Copper and doxorubicin concentrations in the blood pool were similar at 24 h (∼40% of the injected dose), indicating stable circulation of the complex. Highly quenched doxorubicin fluorescence remained in the blood pool over tens of hours, with fluorescence increasing only with the combination of liposome disruption and copper trans-chelation. At 48 h after injection, doxorubicin fluorescence within the heart and skin was one-fifth and one-half, respectively, of fluorescence observed with ammonium sulfate-loaded doxorubicin liposomes. After 28 days of twice per week doxorubicin administration of 6 mg/kg, systemic toxicity (cardiac hypertrophy and weight and hair loss) was not detected with the copper-doxorubicin liposomes but was substantial with ammonium sulfate-loaded doxorubicin liposomes. We then incorporated two strategies designed to enhance efficacy, mTOR inhibition (rapamycin) to slow proliferation and therapeutic ultrasound to enhance accumulation and local diffusion. Tumor accumulation was ∼10% ID/g and was enhanced approximately 2-fold with the addition of therapeutic ultrasound.

The method is currently limited to central brain targets due to skull heating and other factors. An alternative ablative approach combines very low intensity ultrasound bursts and an intravenously administered microbubble agent to locally destroy the vasculature. The objective of this work was to investigate whether it is feasible to use this approach at deep brain targets near the skull base in nonhuman primates. METHODS In 4 rhesus macaques, targets near the skull base were ablated using a clinical TcMRgFUS system operating at 220 kHz. Low-duty-cycle ultrasound exposures (sonications) were applied for 5 minutes in conjunction with the ultrasound contrast agent Definity, which was administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion. The acoustic power level was set to be near the inertial cavitation threshold, which was measured using passive monitoring of the acoustic emissions. The resulting tissue effects were investigated with MRI and with histological analysis performed 3 hours to 1 week after sonication. RESULTS Thirteen targets were sonicated in regions next to the optic tract in the 4 animals. Inertial cavitation, indicated by broadband acoustic emissions, occurred at acoustic pressure amplitudes ranging from 340 to 540 kPa. MRI analysis suggested that the lesions had a central region containing red blood cell extravasations that was surrounded by edema. Blood-brain barrier disruption was observed on contrast-enhanced MRI in the lesions and in a surrounding region corresponding to the prefocal area of the FUS system. In histology, lesions consisting of tissue undergoing ischemic necrosis were found in all regions that were sonicated above the inertial cavitation threshold. Tissue damage in prefocal areas was found in several cases, suggesting that in those cases the sonication exceeded the inertial cavitation threshold in the beam path. CONCLUSIONS It is feasible to use a clinical TcMRgFUS system to ablate skull base targets in nonhuman primates at time-averaged acoustic power levels at least 2 orders of magnitude below what is needed for thermal ablation with this device. The results point to the risks associated with the method if the exposure levels are not carefully controlled to avoid inertial cavitation in the acoustic beam path. If methods can be developed to provide this control, this nonthermal approach could greatly expand the use of TcMRgFUS for precisely targeted ablation to locations across the entire brain.","2016-05","2021-02-22 22:16:49","2021-02-22T22:16:49Z","","1450–9","","5","124","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Number: 5 ISBN: 2015.4.JNS142862 Publisher: American Association of Neurological Surgeons PMID: 26381252","","","","BBB = blood-brain barrier; EAP-FUS144; ETL = echo train length; FUS = focused ultrasound; LFB = Luxol fast blue; TcMRgFUS = transcranial MRI-guided FUS; ablation; acoustic cavitation; focused ultrasound; image-guided therapy; neurosurgery; surgical technique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 11 patients, precisely localized thermal ablations of 3-4 mm in diameter were produced in the posterior part of the central lateral thalamic nucleus at peak temperatures between 51 ° C and 64 ° C with the aid of real-time patient monitoring and MR imaging and MR thermometry guidance. The treated neuropathic pain syndromes had peripheral (5 patients) or central (6 patients) origins and covered all body parts (face, arm, leg, trunk, and hemibody). RESULTS Patients experienced mean pain relief of 49% at the 3-month follow-up (9 patients) and 57% at the 1-year follow-up (8 patients). Mean improvement according to the visual analog scale amounted to 42% at 3 months and 41% at 1 year. Six patients experienced immediate and persisting somatosensory improvements. Somatosensory and vestibular clinical manifestations were always observed during sonication time because of ultrasound-based neuronal activation and/or initial therapeutic effects. Quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) showed a significant reduction in EEG spectral overactivities. Thermal ablation sites showed sharply delineated ellipsoidal thermolesions surrounded by short-lived vasogenic edema. Lesion reconstructions (18 lesions in 9 patients) demonstrated targeting precision within a millimeter for all 3 coordinates. There was 1 complication, a bleed in the target with ischemia in the motor thalamus, which led to the introduction of 2 safety measures, that is, the detection of a potential cavitation by a cavitation detector and the maintenance of sonication temperatures below 60 ° C. CONCLUSIONS The authors assert that tcMRgFUS represents a noninvasive, precise, and radiation-free neurosurgical technique for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The procedure avoids mechanical brain tissue shift and eliminates the risk of infection. The possibility of applying sonication thermal spots free from trajectory restrictions should allow one to optimize target coverage. The real-time continuous MR imaging and MR thermometry monitoring of targeting accuracy and thermal effects are major factors in optimizing precision, safety, and efficacy in an outpatient context.","2012-01","2021-02-22 22:06:59","2021-02-22T22:06:59Z","","E1","","1","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 PMID: 22208894","","","","EAP-FUS048","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The brain is particularly difficult to deliver drugs to because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The impermeability of the BBB is due to the tight junctions connecting adjacent endothelial cells and highly regulatory transport systems of the endothelial cell membranes. The main function of the BBB is ion and volume regulation to ensure conditions necessary for proper synaptic and axonal signaling. However, the same permeability properties that keep the brain healthy also constitute the cause of the tremendous obstacles posed in its pharmacological treatment. The BBB prevents most neurologically active drugs from entering the brain and, as a result, has been isolated as the rate-limiting factor in brain drug delivery. Until a solution to the trans-BBB delivery problem is found, treatments of neurological diseases will remain impeded. Over the past decade, methods that combine Focused Ultrasound (FUS) and microbubbles have been shown to offer the unique capability of noninvasively, locally and transiently open the BBB so as to treat central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Four of the main challenges that have been taken on by our group and discussed in this paper are: 1) assess its safety profile, 2) unveil the mechanism by which the BBB opens and closes, 3) control and predict the opened BBB properties and duration of the opening and 4) assess its premise in brain drug delivery. All these challenges will be discussed, findings in both small (mice) and large (non-human primates) animals are shown and finally the clinical potential for this technique is shown.","2012-01","2021-02-22 22:06:57","2021-02-22T22:06:57Z","","1223–37","","12","2","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 12 Edition: 2013/02/06 ISBN: 1838-7640 (Electronic) 1838-7640 (Linking) PMID: 23382778","","","","Animals; Blood-Brain Barrier/*physiology; Computer Simulation; Drug Delivery Systems; Fluorescence; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mice; Microscopy; Primates; Ultrasonics/*methods; grant; histology; mechanics; opening time; review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simulations were used to optimize transducer geometry with respect to focus size, grating lobes, and directivity. Focus size and grating lobes during electronic steering were quantified using hydrophone measurements in water and a three-axis stage. A novel combination of optical tracking and acoustic mapping enabled measurement of the 3D pressure distribution in the cortical region of an ex vivo skull to within ∼3.5 mm of the surface, and allowed accurate modelling of the experiment via non-homogeneous 3D acoustic simulations. The data demonstrates acoustic focusing beyond the skull bone, with the focus slightly broadened and shifted proximal to the skull. The fabricated design is capable of targeting regions within the S1 sensorimotor cortex of macaques.","2018-04","2021-02-19 22:49:11","2021-02-19T22:49:11Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29667598","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we investigated the application of therapeutic ultrasound methods available in the clinic to increase nanotherapeutic particle accumulation in epithelial and EMT tumors by labeling particles with a positron emission tomography tracer. Epithelial tumors were highly vascularized with tight cell-cell junctions, compared with EMT tumors where cells displayed an irregular, elongated shape with loosened cell-cell adhesions and a reduction in E-cadherin and cytokeratins 8/18 and 19. Without ultrasound, the accumulation of liposomal nanoparticles administered to tumors in vivo was approximately 1.5 times greater in epithelial tumors than EMT tumors. When ultrasound was applied, both nanoaccumulation and apparent tumor permeability were increased in both settings. Notably, ultrasound effects differed with thermal and mechanical indices, such that increasing the thermal ultrasound dose increased nanoaccumulation in EMT tumors. Taken together, our results illustrate how ultrasound can be used to enhance nanoparticle accumulation in tumors by reducing their intratumoral pressure and increasing their vascular permeability.","2012","2021-02-19 22:49:10","2021-02-19T22:49:10Z","","1485–1493","","6","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 6 ISBN: 1538-7445 (Electronic)$\backslash$r0008-5472 (Linking) _eprint: NIHMS150003 PMID: 22282664","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simulations were performed using power deposition maps obtained from the hybrid angular spectrum (HAS) method and applying a finite-difference approximation of the Pennes' bioheat transfer equation for the experimentally used transducer and also for a fully sampled transducer to demonstrate the effect of acoustic window, ultrasound beam overlap and grating lobe clutter on near-field heating.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Both simulation and experimental results show that electronically steering the ultrasound beam for the two trajectories using the 256-element phased array significantly increases the thermal dose deposited in the near-field tissues when compared with the same treatment executed through mechanical steering only.

Intranasal (i.n.) administration is a promising approach for drug delivery to the brain, bypassing the BBB; however, its application has been restricted to particularly potent substances and it does not offer localized delivery to specific brain sites. Focused ultrasound (FUS) in combination with microbubbles can deliver drugs to the brain at targeted locations. The present study proposed to combine these two different platform techniques (FUS+i.n.) for enhancing the delivery efficiency of intranasally administered drugs at a targeted location. After i.n. administration of 40 kDa fluorescently-labeled dextran as the model drug, FUS targeted at one region within the caudate putamen of mouse brains was applied in the presence of systemically administered microbubbles. To compare with the conventional FUS technique, in which intravenous (i.v.) drug injection is employed, FUS was also applied after i.v. injection of the same amount of dextran in another group of mice. Dextran delivery outcomes were evaluated using fluorescence imaging of brain slices. The results showed that FUS+i.n. enhanced drug delivery within the targeted region compared with that achieved by i.n. only. Despite the fact that the i.n. route has limited drug absorption across the nasal mucosa, the delivery efficiency of FUS+i.n. was not significantly different from that of FUS+i.v.. As a new drug delivery platform, the FUS+i.n. technique is potentially useful for treating CNS diseases.","2014-01","2021-02-19 22:48:33","2021-02-19T22:48:33Z","","e108880","","10","9","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 10 PMID: 25279463","","","","Administration; Animals; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain; Dextrans; Drug Delivery Systems; FUS; Interventional; Intranasal; Male; Mice; Microbubbles; Sonication; Ultrasonography; administration & dosage; dextran; diagnostic imaging; drug effects; intranasal; methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A unilateral thalamotomy was performed in piglets utilizing one of 3 stereotactic lesioning modalities: focused ultrasound (FUS), radiofrequency, and radiosurgery. Standard clinical lesioning parameters were used for each treatment; and clinical, MRI, and histological assessments were made at early (\textless 72 hours), subacute (1 week), and later (1-3 months) time intervals. RESULTS: Histological and MRI assessment showed similar development for FUS and radiofrequency lesions. T2-weighted MRI revealed 3 concentric lesional zones at 48 hours with resolution of perilesional edema by 1 week. Acute ischemic infarction with macrophage infiltration was most prominent at 72 hours, with subsequent resolution of the inflammatory reaction and coalescence of the necrotic zone. There was no apparent difference in ischemic penumbra or ""sharpness"" between FUS or radiofrequency lesions. The radiosurgery lesions presented differently, with latent effects, less circumscribed lesions at 3 months, and apparent histological changes seen in white matter beyond the thalamic target. Additionally, thermal and radiation lesioning gradients were compared with modeling by dose to examine the theoretical penumbra. CONCLUSIONS: In swine thalamus, FUS and radiosurgery lesions evolve similarly as determined by MRI, histological examination, and theoretical modeling. Radiosurgery produces lesions with more delayed effects and seemed to result in changes in the white matter beyond the thalamic target.","2013-08","2021-02-19 22:48:30","2021-02-19T22:48:30Z","","307–317","","2","119","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 2 PMID: 23746105","","","","Animals; EAP-FUS111; Female; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pulsed Radiofrequency Treatment; Radiosurgery; Swine; Thalamus; Ultrasonography; methods; pathology; surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The BDNF bioactivity was found to be preserved following delivery as assessed quantitatively by immunohistochemical detection of the pTrkB receptor and activated pAkt, pMAPK, and pCREB in the hippocampal neurons. It was therefore shown for the first time that systemically administered neurotrophic factors can cross the noninvasively disrupted BBB and trigger neuronal downstream signaling effects in a highly localized region in the brain. This is the first time that the administered molecule is tracked through the BBB and localized in the neuron triggering molecular effects. Additional preliminary findings are shown in wild-type mice with two additional neurotrophic factors such as the glia-derived neurotrophic factor (n = 12) and neurturin (n = 2).
