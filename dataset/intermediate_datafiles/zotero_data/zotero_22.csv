B-mode imaging and contrast-enhanced ultrasound are routinely used to detect cancerous lesions in breast and liver. The use of ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) such as microbubbles (MBs), which can be functionalized with targeting ligands, has further enabled ultrasound molecular imaging (USMI) of specific molecular markers in pre-clinical and the first clinical studies. As targeted MBs have a diameter of 1–4 μm, they are limited to the blood vasculature upon intravenous injection, and can bind to markers of the vascular endothelium. USMI with targeted MBs was applied for imaging of markers of inflammation, angiogenesis, and the tumor endothelium. AIM The present review provides an introduction to USMI and presents currently available UCAs, targeting strategies, pre-clinical targets, proposed applications, and the first clinical studies with USMI to guide novel users and assess the technique's potential for clinical use.","2018-10","2021-02-23 04:20:44","2021-02-23T04:20:44Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Masson","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Non-central targets will have to be reached to treat a wider variety of neurological disorders and solid tumors. Treatment envelope studies utilizing two-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry have previously been performed to determine the regions in which therapeutic levels of FUS can currently be delivered. Since 2D MR thermometry was used, very limited information about unintended heating in near-field tissue/bone interfaces could be deduced. METHODS: In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept treatment envelope study with three-dimensional (3D) MR thermometry monitoring of FUS heatings performed in a phantom and a lamb model. While the moderate-sized transducer used was not designed for transcranial geometries, the 3D temperature maps enable monitoring of the entire sonication field of view, including both the focal spot and near-field tissue/bone interfaces, for full characterization of all heating that may occur. 3D MR thermometry is achieved by a combination of k-space subsampling and a previously described temporally constrained reconstruction method. RESULTS: We present two different types of treatment envelopes. The first is based only on the focal spot heating-the type that can be derived from 2D MR thermometry. The second type is based on the relative near-field heating and is calculated as the ratio between the focal spot heating and the near-field heating. This utilizes the full 3D MR thermometry data achieved in this study. CONCLUSIONS: It is shown that 3D MR thermometry can be used to improve the safety assessment in treatment envelope evaluations. Using a non-optimal transducer, it is shown that some regions where therapeutic levels of FUS can be delivered, as suggested by the first type of envelope, are not necessarily safely treated due to the amount of unintended near-field heating occurring. The results presented in this study highlight the need for 3D MR thermometry in tcMRgFUS.","2014-01","2021-02-23 03:19:53","2021-02-23T03:19:53Z","","19","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Number: 1 Publisher: BioMed Central Ltd PMID: 25343028","","","","3-D MRI; Brain; MR thermometry; PRF; Treatment envelope; ablation; tcMRgFUS; thermometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional anterior temporal lobectomy yields seizure-free rates of 60%-70% and possibly higher. The field of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is an evolving field in neurosurgery. There is potential to treat MTLE with MRgFUS; however, it has appeared that the temporal lobe structures were beyond the existing treatment envelope of currently available clinical systems. The purpose of this study was to determine whether lesional temperatures can be achieved in the target tissue and to assess potential safety concerns. METHODS Cadaveric skulls with tissue-mimicking gels were used as phantom targets. An ablative volume was then mapped out for a ""virtual temporal lobectomy."" These data were then used to create a target volume on the InSightec ExAblate Neuro system. The target was the amygdala, uncus, anterior 20 mm of hippocampus, and adjacent parahippocampal gyrus. This volume was approximately 5cm3. Thermocouples were placed on critical skull base structures to monitor skull base heating. RESULTS Adequate focusing of the ultrasound energy was possible in the temporal lobe structures. Using clinically relevant ultrasound parameters (power 900 W, duration 10 sec, frequency 650 kHz), ablative temperatures were not achieved (maximum temperature 46.1°C). Increasing sonication duration to 30 sec demonstrated lesional temperatures in the mesial temporal lobe structures of interest (up to 60.5°C). Heating of the skull base of up to 24.7°C occurred with 30-sec sonications. CONCLUSIONS MRgFUS thermal ablation of the mesial temporal lobe structures relevant in temporal lobe epilepsy is feasible in a laboratory model. Longer sonications were required to achieve temperatures that would create permanent lesions in brain tissue. Heating of the skull base occurred with longer sonications. Blocking algorithms would be required to restrict ultrasound beams causing skull base heating. In the future, MRgFUS may present a minimally invasive, non-ionizing treatment of MTLE.","2016-12","2021-02-23 03:18:36","2021-02-23T03:18:36Z","","1557–1564","","6","125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 6 PMID: 26871207","","","","MRgFUS; MRgFUS = magnetic resonance–guided focused ultraso; MTLE = mesial temporal lobe epilepsy; epilepsy; epilepsy treatment; focused ultrasound; magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound; temporal lobe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

THEORY AND METHODS: Multiband excitation and incoherent blipped-controlled aliasing were implemented in a 2DFT pulse sequence used clinically for tcMRgFUS, and an extended k-space hybrid reconstruction was developed that recovers slice-separated temperature maps assuming that heating is focal, given slice-separated pretreatment images. Simulations were performed to characterize slice leakage, the number of slices that can be simultaneously imaged with low-temperature error, and robustness across random slice-phase k-space permutations. In vivo experiments were performed using a single receive coil without heating to measure temperature precision, and gel phantom FUS experiments were performed to test the method with heating and with a water bath. RESULTS: Simulations showed that with large hot spots and identical magnitude images on each slice, up to three slices can be simultaneously imaged with less than 1 composite function C temperature root-mean-square error. They also showed that hot spots do not alias coherently between slices, and that an average 86% of random slice-phase k-space permutations yielded less than 1 composite function C temperature error. Temperature precision was not degraded compared to single-slice imaging in the in vivo SMS scans, and the gel phantom SMS temperature maps closely tracked single-slice temperature in the hot spot, with no coherent aliasing to other slices.

THEORY AND METHODS: In tcMRgFUS, water is circulated in the transducer bowl around the patient's head for acoustic coupling and heat removal. The water moves during sonications that are monitored by MR thermometry, which causes it to alias into the brain and create temperature errors. To reduce these errors, a two-dimensional excitation pulse was implemented in a gradient-recalled echo thermometry sequence. The pulse suppresses water signal by selectively exciting the brain only, which reduces the imaging FOV. Improvements in temperature precision compared to the conventional full-FOV scan were evaluated in healthy subject scans outside the tcMRgFUS system, gel phantom scans in the system with heating, and in 2x-accelerated head phantom scans in the system without heating. RESULTS: In vivo temperature precision (standard deviation of temperature errors) outside the tcMRgFUS system was improved 43% on average, due to the longer TR and TE of the reduced-FOV sequence. In the phantom heating experiments, the hot spot was less distorted in the reduced-FOV scans, and background temperature precision was improved 59% on average. In the accelerated head phantom temperature reconstructions, temperature precision was improved 89% using the reduced-FOV sequence. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced-FOV temperature imaging alleviates temperature errors due to water bath motion in tcMRgFUS, and enables accelerated temperature mapping with greater precision.","2020-03","2021-02-23 02:24:07","2021-02-23T02:24:07Z","","1016–1024","","3","83","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 3 PMID: 31483525","","","","MRI-guided focused ultrasound; high-intensity focused ultrasound; multidimensional excitation; radiofrequency pulses; selective excitation; temperature imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the optimum imaging sequence for sonothrombolysis. METHODS In vitro blood drawn from 6 healthy volunteers was imaged using T1, T2 spin-echo, and T2 gradient-echo (GRE) sequences both before and after sonication using an Insightec ExAblate 4000 FUS transducer. Signal intensities of the three MR imaging sequences were measured and normalized to background signal for each time point. Representative samples of the pre- and postsonication clot were also sent to pathology for hematologic analysis. RESULTS After sonication, the clot in the treatment tube was fully lysed as evidenced by physical and hematologic evaluation. The difference between pre- and postsonicated normalized signal intensity ratios demonstrated statistical significance only on T2 and GRE sequences (P \textless .001). However, significant blooming artifact limited interpretation on all GRE images. CONCLUSION T2 is the most appropriate sequence for the evaluation of mechanical MRgFUS sonothrombolysis of an in vitro clot. These findings are consistent across the oxidative states of clot up to 48 hours.","2013-04","2021-02-23 02:17:47","2021-02-23T02:17:47Z","","187–91","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 PMID: 22082153","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The factors affecting FUS treatment efficiency are not well understood. Kranion is open-source software that allows the user to simulate the planning stages of FUS treatment and to ""replay"" previous treatments for off-line analysis. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between skull parameters and treatment efficiency and to create a metric to estimate temperature rise during FUS. CT images from 28 patients were analyzed to validate the use of Kranion. For stereotactic targets within each patient, individual transducer element incident angles, skull density ratio, and skull thickness measurements were recorded. A penetration metric (the ""beam index"") was calculated by combining the energy loss from incident angles and the skull thickness. Kranion accurately estimated the patient's skull and treatment parameters. The authors observed significant changes in incident angles with different targets in the brain. Using the beam index as a predictor of temperature rise in a linear-mixed-effects model, they were able to predict the average temperature rise at the focal point during ablation with \textless 21% error (55 degrees C +/- 3.8 degrees C) in 75% of sonications, and with \textless 44% (55 degrees C +/- 7.9 degrees C) in 97% of sonications. This research suggests that the beam index can improve the prediction of temperature rise during FUS. Additional work is required to study the relationship between temperature rise and lesion shape and clinical outcomes.","2019-03","2021-02-22 23:33:05","2021-02-22T23:33:05Z","","1–7","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30835689","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Upon collapsing, such bubbles can induce hemorrhage. Thus, acoustic inertial cavitation secondary to a 220-kHz MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) surgery is a serious safety issue, and animal studies are mandatory for laying the groundwork for the use of low-frequency systems in future clinical trials. The authors investigate here the in vivo potential thresholds of MRgFUS-induced inertial cavitation and MRgFUS-induced thermal coagulation using MRI, acoustic spectroscopy, and histology. METHODS Ten female piglets that had undergone a craniectomy were sonicated using a 220-kHz transcranial MRgFUS system over an acoustic energy range of 5600-14,000 J. For each piglet, a long-duration sonication (40-second duration) was performed on the right thalamus, and a short sonication (20-second duration) was performed on the left thalamus. An acoustic power range of 140-300 W was used for long-duration sonications and 300-700 W for short-duration sonications. Signals collected by 2 passive cavitation detectors were stored in memory during each sonication, and any subsequent cavitation activity was integrated within the bandwidth of the detectors. Real-time 2D MR thermometry was performed during the sonications. T1-weighted, T2-weighted, gradient-recalled echo, and diffusion-weighted imaging MRI was performed after treatment to assess the lesions. The piglets were killed immediately after the last series of posttreatment MR images were obtained. Their brains were harvested, and histological examinations were then performed to further evaluate the lesions. RESULTS Two types of lesions were induced: thermal ablation lesions, as evidenced by an acute ischemic infarction on MRI and histology, and hemorrhagic lesions, associated with inertial cavitation. Passive cavitation signals exhibited 3 main patterns identified as follows: no cavitation, stable cavitation, and inertial cavitation. Low-power and longer sonications induced only thermal lesions, with a peak temperature threshold for lesioning of 53°C. Hemorrhagic lesions occurred only with high-power and shorter sonications. The sizes of the hemorrhages measured on macroscopic histological examinations correlated with the intensity of the cavitation activity (R2 = 0.74). The acoustic cavitation activity detected by the passive cavitation detectors exhibited a threshold of 0.09 V·Hz for the occurrence of hemorrhages. CONCLUSIONS This work demonstrates that 220-kHz ultrasound is capable of inducing a thermal lesion in the brain of living swines without hemorrhage. Although the same acoustic energy can induce either a hemorrhage or a thermal lesion, it seems that low-power, long-duration sonication is less likely to cause hemorrhage and may be safer. Although further study is needed to decrease the likelihood of ischemic infarction associated with the 220-kHz ultrasound, the threshold established in this work may allow for the detection and prevention of deleterious cavitations.","2015-01","2021-02-22 23:30:48","2021-02-22T23:30:48Z","","152–61","","1","122","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 1 PMID: 25380106","","","","FUS; FUS = focused ultrasound; MRgFUS = MRI-guided FUS; MRsFUS; TcMRgFUS = transcranial MRgFUS; acoustic cavitation threshold; inertial cavitation; magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound; pig; surgical technique; swine brain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this study was to describe MR imaging findings pre- and post-ventralis intermedius nucleus lesioning by MR imaging-guided focused sonography as a treatment for essential tremor and to determine whether there was an association between these imaging features and the clinical response to MR imaging-guided focused sonography. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifteen patients with medication-refractory essential tremor prospectively gave consent; were enrolled in a single-site, FDA-approved pilot clinical trial; and were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused sonography. MR imaging studies were obtained on a 3T scanner before the procedure and 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months following the procedure. RESULTS On T2-weighted imaging, 3 time-dependent concentric zones were seen at the site of the focal spot. The inner 2 zones showed reduced ADC values at 24 hours in all patients except one. Diffusion had pseudonormalized by 1 month in all patients, when the cavity collapsed. Very mild postcontrast enhancement was seen at 24 hours and again at 1 month after MR imaging-guided focused sonography. The total lesion size and clinical response evolved inversely compared with each other (coefficient of correlation = 0.29, P value = .02). CONCLUSIONS MR imaging-guided focused sonography can accurately ablate a precisely delineated target, with typical imaging findings seen in the days, weeks, and months following the treatment. Tremor control was optimal early when the lesion size and perilesional edema were maximal and was less later when the perilesional edema had resolved.","2014-05","2021-02-22 23:27:12","2021-02-22T23:27:12Z","","","","5","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 5 PMID: 24371027","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As knowledge of the brain's connectome continues to improve, a more refined understanding of the role of specific circuits in pathologic states will also evolve. Tools capable of manipulating identified circuits in a targeted and restricted manner will be essential not only to expand our understanding of the functional roles of such circuits, but also to therapeutically disconnect critical pathways contributing to neurologic disease. This study took advantage of the ability of low-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) to transiently disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to deliver a neurotoxin with poor BBB permeability (quinolinic acid [QA]) in a guided manner to a target region in the brain parenchyma. Ten male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups receiving the following treatments: (i) magnetic resonance-guided FUS + microbubbles + saline (n = 5), or (ii) magnetic resonance-guided FUS + microbubbles + QA (n = 5). Systemic administration of QA was well tolerated. However, when QA and microbubbles were systemically administered in conjunction with magnetic resonance-guided FUS, the BBB was disrupted and primary neurons were destroyed in the targeted subregion of the hippocampus in all QA-treated animals. Administration of vehicle (saline) together with microbubbles and FUS also disrupted the BBB but did not produce neuronal injury. These findings indicate the feasibility of non-invasively destroying a targeted region of the brain parenchyma using low-intensity FUS together with systemic administration of microbubbles and a neurotoxin. This approach could be of therapeutic value in various disorders in which disturbances of neural circuitry contribute to neurologic disease.","2016-05","2021-02-22 23:22:59","2021-02-22T23:22:59Z","","2261–9","","9","42","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Number: 9 Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 27260243","","","","Blood–brain barrier; Epilepsy; Hippocampus; Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound; Quinolinic acid; Transcranial drug delivery; epilepsy; neurotoxin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Described here are the designs, methods for fabrication, and notes on utility of three different ultrasound phantoms to be used for brain focused ultrasound research. METHODS: Three different models of phantoms are developed and tested to be accurate, repeatable experimental options to provide means to further this research. The three models are a cadaver, a gel-filled skull, and a head mold containing a skull and filled with gel that mimics the brain and the skin. Each was positioned in a clinical tcMRgFUS system and sonicated at 1100 W (acoustic) for 12 s at different locations. Maximum temperature rise as measured by MR thermometry was recorded and compared against clinical data for a similar neurosurgical target. Results are presented as heating efficiency in units ( degrees C/kW/s) for direct comparison to available clinical data. The procedure for casting thermal phantom material is presented. The utility of each phantom model is discussed in the context of various tcMRgFUS research areas. RESULTS: The cadaveric phantom model, gel-filled skull model, and full head phantom model had heating efficiencies of 5.3, 4.0, and 3.9 degrees C/(kW/s), respectively, compared to a sample clinical heating efficiency of 2.6 degrees C/(kW/s). In the seven research categories considered, the cadaveric phantom model was the most versatile, though less practical compared to the ex-vivo skull-based phantoms. CONCLUSIONS: Casting thermal phantom material was shown to be an effective way to prepare tissue-mimicking material for the phantoms presented. The phantom models presented are all useful in tcMRgFUS research, though some are better suited to a limited subset of applications depending on the researchers needs.","2015-04","2021-02-22 23:15:05","2021-02-22T23:15:05Z","","1518–1527","","4","42","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 4 PMID: 25832042","","","","Biological; Echoencephalography; Equipment Design; Head; Humans; Hydrogels; Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models; Phantoms; Temperature; Thermometry; Tomography; X-Ray Computed; diagnostic imaging; instrumentation; methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thermal dose denatures proteins and the radiation dose causes DNA damage in order to achieve ablation. The purpose of this paper is to use the proportion of cell survival as a potential common unit by which to measure the biological effect of each procedure. Survival curves for both thermal and radiation doses have been extracted from previously published data for three different cell types. Fits of these curves were used to convert both thermal and radiation dose into the same quantified biological effect: fraction of surviving cells. They have also been used to generate and compare survival profiles from the only indication for which clinical data are available for both focused ultrasound (FUS) thermal ablation and radiation ablation: essential tremor thalamotomy. All cell types could be fitted with coefficients of determination greater than 0.992. As an illustration, survival profiles of clinical thalamotomies performed by radiosurgery and FUS are plotted on a same graph for the same metric: fraction of surviving cells. FUS and Gamma Knife have the potential to be used in combination to deliver a more effective treatment (for example, FUS may be used to debulk the main tumour mass, and radiation to treat the surrounding tumour bed). In this case, a model which compares thermal and radiation treatments is valuable in order to adjust the dose between the two.","2017-01","2021-02-22 23:13:33","2021-02-22T23:13:33Z","","1–13","","4","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 4 PMID: 28044461","","","","Ultrasound; damage index; high intensity focused ultrasound; radiation dose; thermal dose","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The authors performed in vitro and in vivo studies of ultrasound transmission through a cranial prosthesis. In the in vitro phase, they analyzed the transmission of ultrasound energy through the prosthesis in a water tank using various transducers with resonance frequencies corresponding to those of devices used for neurosurgical imaging and therapeutic purposes. Four distinct, single-element, focused transducers were tested at fundamental frequencies of 500 kHz, 1 MHz, 2.5 MHz, and 5 MHz. In addition, the authors tested ultrasound transmission through the prosthesis using a linear diagnostic probe (center frequency 5.3 MHz) with a calibrated needle hydrophone in free water. Each transducer was assessed across a range of input voltages that encompassed their full minimum to maximum range without waveform distortion. They also tested the effect of the prosthesis on beam pressure and geometry. In the in vivo phase, the authors performed ultrasound imaging through the prosthesis implanted in a swine model. RESULTS: Acoustic power attenuation through the prosthesis was considerably lower than that reported to occur through the native cranial bone. Increasing the frequency of the transducer augmented the degree of acoustic power loss. The degradation/distortion of the ultrasound beams passing through the prosthesis was minimal in all 3 spatial planes (XY, XZ, and YZ) that were examined. The images acquired in vivo demonstrated no spatial distortion from the prosthesis, with spatial relationships that were superimposable to those acquired through the dura. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the tests performed on the polyolefin-based cranial prosthesis indicated that this is a valid medium for delivering both focused and unfocused ultrasound and obtaining ultrasound images of the intracranial space. The prosthesis may serve for several diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound-based applications, including bedside imaging of the brain and ultrasound-guided focused ultrasound cerebral procedures.","2020-01","2021-02-22 23:11:58","2021-02-22T23:11:58Z","","1–13","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31899872","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These corrections are currently calculated based on a preacquired computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient's head. The purpose of the work presented here is to demonstrate the feasibility of using ultrashort echo-time magnetic resonance imaging (UTE MRI) instead of CT to calculate and apply aberration corrections on a clinical TcMRgFUS system. METHODS: Phantom experiments were performed in three ex-vivo human skulls filled with tissue-mimicking hydrogel. Each skull phantom was imaged with both CT and UTE MRI. The MR images were then segmented into ""skull"" and ""not-skull"" pixels using a computationally efficient, threshold-based algorithm, and the resulting 3D binary skull map was converted into a series of 2D virtual CT images. Each skull was mounted in the head transducer of a clinical TcMRgFUS system (ExAblate Neuro, Insightec, Israel), and transcranial sonications were performed using a power setting of approximately 750 acoustic watts at several different target locations within the electronic steering range of the transducer. Each target location was sonicated three times: once using aberration corrections calculated from the actual CT scan, once using corrections calculated from the MRI-derived virtual CT scan, and once without applying any aberration correction. MR thermometry was performed in conjunction with each 10-s sonication, and the highest single-pixel temperature rise and surrounding-pixel mean were recorded for each sonication. RESULTS: The measured temperature rises were approximately 45% larger for aberration-corrected sonications than for noncorrected sonications. This improvement was highly significant (p \textless 10(-4)). The difference between the single-pixel peak temperature rise and the surrounding-pixel mean, which reflects the sharpness of the thermal focus, was also significantly larger for aberration-corrected sonications. There was no significant difference between the sonication results achieved using CT-based and MR-based aberration correction. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have demonstrated that transcranial focal heating can be significantly improved in vitro by using UTE MRI to compute skull-induced ultrasound aberration corrections. Their results suggest that UTE MRI could be used instead of CT to implement such corrections on current 0.7 MHz clinical TcMRgFUS devices. The MR image acquisition and segmentation procedure demonstrated here would add less than 15 min to a clinical MRgFUS treatment session.","2015-05","2021-02-22 23:08:53","2021-02-22T23:08:53Z","","2223–2233","","5","42","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 5 PMID: 25979016","","","","Algorithms; Biological; Brain; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Imaging; Interventional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models; Phantoms; Skull; Temperature; Three-Dimensional; Tomography; Ultrasonic Therapy; X-Ray Computed; diagnostic imaging; instrumentation; methods; pathology; physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is an emerging modality for cancer treatment which combines ultrasound with sonosensitizers to produce a localized cytotoxic effect. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of SDT with fluorescein (FL) and low-intensity focused ultrasound in inhibiting the growth of ectopic gliomas implanted in the rat's subcutaneous tissue. METHODS: In vivo cytotoxicity of FL-SDT was evaluated in C6 rat glioma cells which were inoculated subcutaneously. Tumor specific extracellular FL extravasation and accumulation was assessed with IVIS imaging in rats receiving systemic FL. Effects of FL-SDT with focused low-intensity ultrasound on tumor growth, and histological features of the rat's tumors were investigated. Treatment related apoptosis and necrosis were analyzed using hematoxylin & eosin, and apoptosis-specific staining. RESULTS: IVIS imaging revealed a high degree of FL accumulation within the tumor, with a nearly threefold increase in tumoral epifluorescence signal over background. SDT significantly inhibited outgrowth of ectopic C6 gliomas across all three FUS exposure conditions. TUNEL and active caspase-3 staining did not reveal conclusive trends across control and SDT condition for apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that SDT with FL and low-intensity FUS is effective in inhibiting the growth of ectopic malignant gliomas in rats. The selective FL extravasation and accumulation in the tumor areas where the blood-brain barrier is damaged suggests the tumor-specificity of the treatment. The possibility to use this treatment in intracranial models and in human gliomas will have to be explored in further studies.","2020-07","2021-02-22 22:45:27","2021-02-22T22:45:27Z","","445–454","","3","148","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 3 PMID: 32500440","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility and safety of MR-guided FUS surgery in the setting of a previously implanted DBS system. METHODS: Three preclinical experiments were designed to test feasibility and safety. Hydrogels were implanted with an electrode, and FUS lesions were targeted adjacently. Cadavers were implanted with a thalamic electrode, and FUS lesions were targeted in the contralateral thalamus. Finally, DBS systems were implanted in swine, and FUS lesioning was targeted to the contralateral thalamus, MRI was used to assess the treatments, and histological analyses were performed at 2 days and at 1 month. RESULTS: In gel experiments and cadavers, FUS resulted in target heating to 29-32 degrees C without any heating at the electrode.

However, treatments require millimetre-scale accuracy. The use of high frequencies (typically \textgreater/=1 MHz) decreases the ultrasonic wavelength to the millimetre scale, thereby increasing the clinical accuracy and lowering the probability of cavitation, which improves the safety of the technique compared with the use of low-frequency devices that operate at 220 kHz. Nevertheless, the skull produces greater distortions of high-frequency waves relative to low-frequency waves. High-frequency waves require high-performance adaptive focusing techniques, based on modelling the wave propagation through the skull. This study sought to optimise the acoustical modelling of the skull based on computed tomography (CT) for a 1 MHz clinical brain therapy system. The best model tested in this article corresponded to a maximum speed of sound of 4000 m.s-1 in the skull bone, and it restored 86% of the optimal pressure amplitude on average in a collection of six human skulls. Compared with uncorrected focusing, the optimised non-invasive correction led to an average increase of 99% in the maximum pressure amplitude around the target and an average decrease of 48% in the distance between the peak pressure and the selected target. The attenuation through the skulls was also assessed within the bandwidth of the transducers, and it was found to vary in the range of 10 +/- 3 dB at 800 kHz and 16 +/- 3 dB at 1.3 MHz.","2017-09","2021-02-22 22:40:28","2021-02-22T22:40:28Z","","635–645","","6","33","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Number: 6 PMID: 28540778","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Surgical techniques are limited by their invasive nature and the associated disability caused during clot removal. Preliminary data have shown promise for the feasibility of transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) sonothrombolysis in liquefying the clotted blood in ICH and thereby facilitating minimally invasive evacuation of the clot via a twist-drill craniostomy and aspiration tube. METHODS AND RESULTS In an in vitro model, the following optimum transcranial sonothrombolysis parameters were determined: transducer center frequency 230 kHz, power 3950 W, pulse repetition rate 1 kHz, duty cycle 10%, and sonication duration 30 seconds. Safety studies were performed in swine (n = 20). In a swine model of ICH, MRgFUS sonothrombolysis of 4 ml ICH was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging and histological examination demonstrated complete lysis of the ICH without additional brain injury, blood-brain barrier breakdown, or thermal necrosis due to sonothrombolysis. A novel cadaveric model of ICH was developed with 40-ml clots implanted into fresh cadaveric brains (n = 10). Intracerebral hemorrhages were successfully liquefied (\textgreater 95%) with transcranial MRgFUS in a highly accurate fashion, permitting minimally invasive aspiration of the lysate under MRI guidance. CONCLUSIONS The feasibility of transcranial MRgFUS sonothrombolysis was demonstrated in in vitro and cadaveric models of ICH. Initial in vivo safety data in a swine model of ICH suggest the process to be safe. Minimally invasive treatment of ICH with MRgFUS warrants evaluation in the setting of a clinical trial.","2013-05","2021-02-22 22:28:33","2021-02-22T22:28:33Z","","1035–45","","5","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 5 PMID: 23330996","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we developed a new sonoporation device generating and monitoring acoustic cavitation bubbles without any addition of contrast agents. The device was used to potentiate the delivery of active doxorubicin into both adherent and suspended cell lines. Combining doxorubicin with ultrasound resulted in a significant enhancement of doxorubicin intracellular delivery and a decrease in cell viability at 48 and 72 h, in comparison to doxorubicin alone. More importantly and unlike previous investigations, our procedure does not require the addition of contrast agents to generate acoustic cavitation and to achieve high levels of doxorubicin delivery. The successful translation of this approach for an in vivo application may allow a significant reduction in the dosage and the adverse effects of doxorubicin therapy in patients.","2017-02","2021-02-22 22:25:49","2021-02-22T22:25:49Z","","441–447","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 PMID: 28107023","","","","cavitation; cell death; doxorubicin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Standard of treatment of these pathologies is based on multidisciplinary approaches encompassing combination of interventional procedures such as open and endovascular surgeries, drugs (chemotherapies, anti-coagulants, anti-platelet therapies, thrombolytics), and radiation therapies. In this context, therapeutic ultrasound could represent a novel diagnostic/therapeutic in the armamentarium of the surgeon to treat these diseases. Ultrasound relies on mechanical energy to induce numerous physical and biological effects. The application of this technology in neurology has been limited due to the challenges with penetrating the skull, thus limiting a prompt translation as has been seen in treating pathologies in other organs, such as breast and abdomen. Thanks to pivotal adjuncts such as multiconvergent transducers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance, MRI thermometry, implantable transducers, and acoustic windows, focused ultrasound (FUS) is ready for prime-time applications in oncology and cerebrovascular neurology. In this review, we analyze the evolution of FUS from the beginning in 1950s to current state-of-the-art.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the in vivo feasibility, including dosage requirements and safety, of generating well-confined destructive lesions within the porcine brain utilizing histotripsy technology.METHODSFollowing a craniectomy to open an acoustic window to the brain, histotripsy pulses were delivered to generate lesions in the porcine cortex. Large lesions with a major dimension of up to 1 cm were generated to demonstrate the efficacy of histotripsy lesioning in the brain. Gyrus-confined lesions were generated at different applied dosages and under ultrasound imaging guidance to ensure that they were accurately targeted and contained within individual gyri. Clinical evaluation as well as MRI and histological outcomes were assessed in the acute (≤ 6 hours) and subacute (≤ 72 hours) phases of recovery.RESULTSHistotripsy was able to generate lesions with a major dimension of up to 1 cm in the cortex. Histotripsy lesions were seen to be well demarcated with sharp boundaries between treated and untreated tissues, with histological evidence of injuries extending ≤ 200 µm from their boundaries in all cases. In animals with lesions confined to the gyrus, no major hemorrhage or other complications resulting from treatment were observed. At 72 hours, MRI revealed minimal to no edema and no radiographic evidence of inflammatory changes in the perilesional area. Histological evaluation revealed the histotripsy lesions to be similar to subacute infarcts.CONCLUSIONSHistotripsy can be used to generate sharply defined lesions of arbitrary shapes and sizes in the swine cortex. Lesions confined to within the gyri did not lead to significant hemorrhage or edema responses at the treatment site in the acute or subacute time intervals.","2018","2021-02-19 22:49:13","2021-02-19T22:49:13Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Until now, the trigeminal nerve was believed to be beyond the treatment envelope of existing high-frequency transcranial MRgFUS systems. In this study, the authors explore the feasibility of targeting the trigeminal nerve in a cadaveric model with temperature assessments using computer simulations and an in vitro skull phantom model fitted with thermocouples. METHODS Six trigeminal nerves from 4 unpreserved cadavers were targeted in the first experiment. Preprocedural CT scanning of the head was performed to allow for a skull correction algorithm. Three-Tesla, volumetric, FIESTA MRI sequences were performed to delineate the trigeminal nerve and any vascular structures of the cisternal segment. The cadaver was positioned in a focused ultrasound transducer (650-kHz system, ExAblate Neuro, InSightec) so that the focus of the transducer was centered at the proximal trigeminal nerve, allowing for targeting of the root entry zone (REZ) and the cisternal segment. Real-time, 2D thermometry was performed during the 10- to 30-second sonication procedures. Post hoc MR thermometry was performed on a computer workstation at the conclusion of the procedure to analyze temperature effects at neuroanatomical areas of interest. Finally, the region of the trigeminal nerve was targeted in a gel phantom encased within a human cranium, and temperature changes in regions of interest in the skull base were measured using thermocouples. RESULTS The trigeminal nerves were clearly identified in all cadavers for accurate targeting. Sequential sonications of 25-1500 W for 10-30 seconds were successfully performed along the length of the trigeminal nerve starting at the REZ. Real-time MR thermometry confirmed the temperature increase as a narrow focus of heating by a mean of 10°C. Postprocedural thermometry calculations and thermocouple experiments in a phantom skull were performed and confirmed minimal heating of adjacent structures including the skull base, cranial nerves, and cerebral vessels. For targeting, inclusion of no-pass regions through the petrous bone decreased collateral heating in the internal acoustic canal from 16.7°C without blocking to 5.7°C with blocking. Temperature at the REZ target decreased by 3.7°C with blocking. Similarly, for midcisternal targeting, collateral heating at the internal acoustic canal was improved from a 16.3°C increase to a 4.9°C increase. Blocking decreased the target temperature increase by 4.4°C for the same power settings. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates focal heating of up to 18°C in a cadaveric trigeminal nerve at the REZ and along the cisternal segment with transcranial MRgFUS. Significant heating of the skull base and surrounding neural structures did not occur with implementation of no-pass regions. However, in vivo studies are necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of this potentially new, noninvasive treatment.","2013-02","2021-02-19 22:49:13","2021-02-19T22:49:13Z","","319–28","","2","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 PMID: 23157185","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A cavitation exposure outside the region of interest may lead to suboptimal treatment efficacy or in a worse case, to safety issues. Current methods of localizing cavitation are based on imaging approaches, such as beamforming the cavitation signals received passively by a US imager. These methods, although efficient, require expensive equipment, which may discourage potential future developments. We propose a threehydrophone method to localize the cavitation cloud source. Firstly, the delays between the three receptors are measured by detecting the maximum of their inter-correlations. Then, the position of the source is calculated by either minimizing a cost function or solving hyperbolic equations. After a numerical validation, the method was assessed experimentally. This method was able to track a source displacement with accuracy similar to the size of the cavitation cloud (2-4 millimeters). This light and versatile method provides interesting perspectives since localization can be executed in real time and the extension to three-dimensional localization seems straightforward.","2018-04","2021-02-19 22:49:13","2021-02-19T22:49:13Z","","1093–1101","","7","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 7 PMID: 29993829","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Theses microbubbles usually consist of a gas core stabilized by surfactant molecules. In this study, a technique using Shirasu Porous Glass (SPG) membranes was used to produce perfluorocarbon microbubbles. The microbubbles obtained were characterized by their size, size distribution, and stability. The effect of several parameters on the microbubble's size was investigated related to the process (transmembrane pressure, ΔP, bubble point pressure, PBP, shear stress, τw), membrane pore size, Dp, and formulation (gas, surfactants in the aqueous phase). The transmembrane pressure nor the shear stress (τw) had influence on the microbubble's size or size distribution for ΔP/PBP \textless1.5. The decrease of the membrane pore size from 1.1, 0.5, to 0.2 μm led to lower microbubble size 13.3, 6.36, and 4.42 μm, respectively, which was associated with higher size distribution 16%, 24% and 31%, respectively due to the higher Laplace pressure exerted on smaller microbubbles leading to their destabilization. With the 1.1 μm pore size membrane, perfluorocarbon microbubbles were obtained with a diameter of 13.3 μm and coefficient of variation (CV) of 16% when stabilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 15.6 μm with CV% of 23% when stabilized by Tween20, and 16.5 μm with CV% of 26% when stabilized by Polyoxyethylene (40) stearate (PEG40S). These low CV were indication of monodispersity. Perfluorocarbon microbubbles had a smaller size than air microbubbles due to the lower surface tension that decreased the retention force, keeping the microbubbles at the pore opening. The stability study showed that the perfluorocarbon gas greatly increased the lifetime of the microbubbles with a slight increase in size of 1.3 after 90 s compared to 2.2 for air microbubbles. Overall, the membrane technique proved to be an effective, controlled and reproducible method to produce perfluorocarbon microbubbles at a high rate ∼0.6 − 1.5 × 10+10 microbubbles/min. The key factor that determines the microbubbles formation is the adsorption kinetics of the surfactant at the new gas–liquid interface at the pore opening.","2019-01","2021-02-19 22:49:12","2021-02-19T22:49:12Z","","233–243","","","560","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each one of these physical effects is solved in the frequency domain for successive planes. Comparing the confocal setup with equivalent single transducer setups, it is shown that, with the confocal configuration, nonlinear distortion of the waveform is reduced, resulting in a greater peak rarefactional pressure and a lower peak positive pressure.

They have been used both for creating therapeutic lesions within dysfunctional brain circuits and to destroy intracranial tumors and space-occupying masses. Despite the introduction of new effective drugs and neuromodulative techniques, which became more popular and subsequently caused brain ablation techniques to fall out favor, recent technological advances have led to the resurgence of lesioning with an improved safety profile. Currently, the four main ablative techniques that are used for ablative brain surgery are radiofrequency thermoablation, stereotactic radiosurgery, laser interstitial thermal therapy and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound thermal ablation. Object: To review the physical principles underlying brain ablative therapies and to describe their use for neurological disorders. Methods: The literature regarding the neurosurgical applications of brain ablative therapies has been reviewed. Results: Ablative treatments have been used for several neurological disorders, including movement disorders, psychiatric disorders, chronic pain, drug-resistant epilepsy and brain tumors. Conclusions: There are several ongoing efforts to use novel ablative therapies directed towards the brain. The recent development of techniques that allow for precise targeting, accurate delivery of thermal doses and real-time visualization of induced tissue damage during the procedure have resulted in novel techniques for cerebral ablation such as magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound or laser interstitial thermal therapy. However, older techniques such as radiofrequency thermal ablation or stereotactic radiosurgery still have a pivotal role in the management of a variety of neurological disorders.","2019-10","2021-02-19 22:48:16","2021-02-19T22:48:16Z","","64–80","","2","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 2 PMID: 31537157","","","","Cerebral ablation; high-intensity focused ultrasound; laser interstitial thermal therapy; magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound; radiofrequency; thermal lesioning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
