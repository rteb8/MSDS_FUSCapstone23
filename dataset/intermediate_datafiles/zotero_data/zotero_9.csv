In this work, we present a deep learning based approach to  temperature monitoring based on radio-frequency (RF) US data. We used Siamese  neural networks in an unsupervised way to spatially compare RF data collected at  different time points of the heating process. The Siamese model consisted of two  identical networks initially trained on a large set of simulated RF data to  assess tissue backscattering properties. To illustrate our approach, we  experimented with a tissue-mimicking phantom and an ex-vivo tissue sample, which  were both heated with a HIFU transducer. During the experiments, we collected RF  data with a regular US scanner. To determine spatiotemporal variations in  temperature distribution within the samples, we extracted small 2D patches of RF  data and compared them with the Siamese network. Our method achieved good  performance in determining the spatiotemporal distribution of temperature during  heating. Compared with the temperature monitoring based on the change in  radio-frequency signal backscattered energy parameter, our method provided more  smooth spatial parametric maps and did not generate ripple artifacts. The  proposed approach, when fully developed, might be used for US based temperature  monitoring of tissues.","2022-05","2024-03-06 17:08:21","2024-03-06T17:08:21Z","","106689","","","122","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

This review focuses on the use of an invertebrate animal, the marine mollusk  Aplysia californica, in the development of novel neurotechniques. We review the  basic physiological properties of Aplysia neurons and discuss the specific  aspects that make it advantageous for developing novel neural interfaces: First,  Aplysia nerves consist only of unmyelinated axons with various diameters,  providing a particularly useful model of the unmyelinated C fibers in vertebrates  that are known to carry important sensory information, including those that  signal pain. Second, Aplysia's neural tissues can last for a long period in an ex  vivo experimental setup. This allows comprehensive tests such as the exploration  of parameter space on the same nerve to avoid variability between animals and  minimize animal use. Third, nerves in large Aplysia can be many centimeters in  length, making it possible to easily discriminate axons with different diameters  based on their conduction velocities. Aplysia nerves are a particularly good  approximation of the unmyelinated C fibers, which are hard to stimulate, record,  and differentiate from other nerve fibers in vertebrate animal models using  epineural electrodes. Fourth, neurons in Aplysia are large, uniquely  identifiable, and electrically compact. For decades, researchers have used  Aplysia for the development of many novel neurotechnologies. Examples include  high-frequency alternating current (HFAC), focused ultrasound (FUS), optical  neural stimulation, recording, and inhibition, microelectrode arrays, diamond  electrodes, carbon fiber microelectrodes, microscopic magnetic stimulation and  magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT). We also review a  specific example that illustrates the power of Aplysia for accelerating  technology development: selective infrared neural inhibition of small-diameter  unmyelinated axons, which may lead to a translationally useful treatment in the  future. Generally, Aplysia is suitable for testing modalities whose mechanism  involves basic biophysics that is likely to be similar across species. As a  tractable experimental system, Aplysia californica can help the rapid development  of novel neuromodulation technologies.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1080027","","","16","","Front Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Zhuo, Gill, Jansen, Jenkins and Chiel.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36620467  PMCID: PMC9813496","","","","Aplysia; infrared neural inhibition; infrared neural modulation; infrared neural stimulation; neuromodulation; small-diameter axon block; thermal inhibition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the same time, other fibroid-like tumors have similar clinical  presentations and about 0.5% of resected tumors of which were presumed benign  fibroids in the preoperative diagnosis revealed as malignant sarcomas in the  final histopathological examination. Amid the emergence of nonsurgical or  minimally invasive procedures for symptomatic benign uterine fibroids, such as  uterine artery embolization, high-intensity-focused ultrasound, or laparoscopic  myomectomy, the preoperative diagnosis of uterine tumors through imaging becomes  all the more relevant. Preoperative tissue sampling is challenging because of the  variable location of the myometrial mass; thus, the preoperative evaluation of  size and location is increasingly performed through magnetic resonance imaging.  Features in images might also be useful for examining the full spectrum of such  growths, from benign fibroids to neoplasms of uncertain behavior and malignant  sarcomas. Benign fibroids include usual-type leiomyomas, myomas with  degeneration, and mitotically active leiomyomas. Neoplasms of uncertain behavior  include smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential, leiomyomas with  bizarre nuclei, and cellular leiomyomas. Malignant sarcomas comprise  leiomyosarcomas, endometrial stromal sarcomas, adenosarcomas, and  carcinosarcomas. The purpose of this article is to review the spectrum of MRI  findings of uterine fibroid-like tumors, from benign variants, uncertain behavior  to malignant sarcomas, and update the advanced imaging modalities, including  diffusion-weighted imaging, positron emission tomography/computed tomography,  combining texture analysis and radiomics, to tackle this important issue.","2022-06","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2197-2208","","6","47","","Abdom Radiol (NY)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Our ability to hear is crucial in providing information and enabling interaction  with our environment. The human brain generates neural oscillations or brainwaves  through synchronised electrical impulses. In epilepsy these brainwaves can change  and form rhythmic bursts of abnormal activity outwardly appearing as seizures.  When two waveforms meet, they can superimpose onto one another forming  constructive, destructive or mixed interference. The effects of audible  soundwaves on epileptic brainwaves has been largely explored with music. The  Mozart Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 448 has been examined in a number of  studies where significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity exists. These  studies report variable reductions in seizures and interictal epileptiform  discharges. Treatment effects of Mozart Piano Sonata in C Major, K.545 and other  composer interventions have been examined with some musical exposures, for  example Hayden's Symphony No. 94 appearing pro-epileptic. The underlying  anti-epileptic mechanism of Mozart music is currently unknown, but interesting  research is moving away from dopamine reward system theories to computational  analysis of specific auditory parameters. In the last decade several studies have  examined inaudible low intensity focused ultrasound as a neuro-modulatory  intervention in focal epilepsy. Whilst acute and chronic epilepsy rodent model  studies have consistently demonstrated an anti-epileptic treatment effect this is  yet to be reported within large scale human trials. Inaudible infrasound is of  concern since at present there are no reported studies on the effects of exposure  to infrasound on epilepsy. Understanding the impact of infrasound on epilepsy is  critical in an era where sustainable energies are likely to increase exposure.","2022-11","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","22-31","","","102","","Seizure","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

Therefore, the accuracy and enrichment rate of  targeted drugs should be improved. We designed a visual diagnosis and treatment  system based on hierarchical targeting. It consists of multifunctional magnetic  nanoparticles and a bio magnetic material. Bio-magnet mediated primary targeting  can effectively improve the drug enrichment rate in the target tissue. SNF  peptide/epithelial cell adhesion molecule antibody mediated targeting liver  cancer stem cells (LCSCs) (secondary target) can improve the accuracy of the  treatment and its outcomes. Low intensity focused ultrasound irradiation can  explode nanoparticles around LCSCs, which can cause physical damage to cells. The  combination of released interferon gamma and its receptor (tertiary target) can  be used to initiate chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Using the optical properties  of Fe(3)O(4) and the phase transformation ability of perfluoropentane, the system  can enhance photoacoustic and ultrasonic molecular imaging enabling diagnosis and  treatment visualization. Targeting LCSCs can accurately provide physical,  chemical, and immune treatment of Hepatocellular carcinoma, making the  therapeutic effect more effective and thorough.

Imaging-defined endpoints following nonsurgical  treatments for fibroids are limited. Materials and Methods: Fibroid  Interventions: Reducing Symptoms Today and Tomorrow (FIRSTT), a randomized  controlled trial of uterine artery embolization (UAE) versus magnetic resonance  imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS), enrolled premenopausal women  with symptomatic uterine fibroids. In this subanalysis, we report imaging results  up to 36 months after UAE or MRgFUS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was  performed at baseline for all women and during the 36 months after treatment if  they did not meet other study endpoints. The main outcome of this subanalysis was  fibroid volume reduction (defined both in terms of total fibroid load and volume  of the largest fibroid), uterine volume reduction, and nonperfused volume.  Results: During 2010-2014, 25 of the 37 women who were randomized and treated at  Mayo Clinic had a 24-month follow-up MRI (11 UAE; 14 MRgFUS); among these women,  15 (7 UAE and 8 MRgFUS) had a 36-month follow-up MRI. Average age for the cohort  was 44.1 (standard deviation, SD = 4.4) years. Nine patients had a second fibroid  procedure by 36 months (seven in the MRgFUS arm and two in UAE arm). Median total  fibroid load reduction was ∼50% in both treatment arms at both 24- and 36-month  follow-up. Volume of the largest fibroid decreased more in the MRgFUS arm,  whereas uterine volume decreased more in the UAE arm (neither reached statistical  significance). At 24 months, median nonperfused volume was higher in the UAE arm  (92%) than the MRgFUS arm (10%). Conclusions: Similar fibroid volume reduction  was seen for the MRgFUS and UAE treatments in this comparative effectiveness  study. Nonperfused volume 24 months after the procedure was higher in the UAE arm  than in the MRgFUS arm.

In thermal ablative therapy, such  as laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), transcranial MR-guided focused  ultrasound (tcMRgFUS), and needle-based therapeutic ultrasound (NBTU), how the  surrounding area is affected has not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to  quantify the transition zone surrounding the ablation core created by magnetic  resonance-guided robotically-assisted (MRgRA) delivery of NBTU using multi-slice  volumetric 2-D magnetic resonance thermal imaging (MRTI) and subsequent  characterization of the resultant tissue damage using histopathologic analysis.  METHODS: Four swine underwent MRgRA NBTU using varying duration and wattage for  treatment delivery. Serial MRI images were obtained, and the most representative  were overlaid with isodose lines and compared to brain tissue acquired postmortem  which underwent histopathologic analysis. These results were also compared to  predicted volumes using a finite element analysis model. Contralateral brain  tissue was used for control data. RESULTS: Intraoperative MRTI thermal isodose  contours were characterized and comprehensively mapped to post-operative MRI  images and qualitatively compared with histological tissue sections postmortem.  NBTU 360° ablations induced smaller lesion volumes (33.19 mm(3); 120 s, 3 W;  30.05 mm(3), 180 s, 4 W) versus 180° ablations (77.20 mm(3), 120 s, 3 W;  109.29 mm(3); 180 s; 4 W). MRTI/MRI overlay demonstrated the lesion within the  proximal isodose lines. The ablation-zone was characterized by dense macrophage  infiltration and glial/neuronal loss as demonstrated by glial fibrillary acidic  protein (GFAP) and neurofilament (NF) absence and avid CD163 staining. The  transition-zone between lesion and normal brain demonstrated decreased macrophage  infiltration and measured ∼345 microns (n - 3). We did not detect overt  hemorrhages or signs of edema in the adjacent spared tissue. CONCLUSION: We  successfully performed MRgRA NBTU ablation in swine and demonstrated minimal  histologic changes extended past the ablation-zone. The lesion was characterized  by macrophage infiltration and glial/neuronal loss which decreased through the  transition-zone.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1283-1293","","1","39","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36162814","","","","*Brain/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Ultrasonic Therapy; Animals; Brain metastases; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Liver; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Swine; focused ultrasound; histological analysis; magnetic resonance-guided robotically assisted delivery; needle-based therapeutic ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The patient came to the hospital with abdominal bloating that occurred 6 mo after  ultrasound-guided HIFU ablation for managing uterine fibroids. The ventral  hernia, which occurred due to atrophied muscle layers following the procedure,  was confirmed by imaging studies and intraoperative findings. She required a  hernia repair with mesh and hysterectomy for definitive treatment of uterine  fibroid.

As a result, for two-dimensional and  three-dimensional cases, KZK equations composed of the linear combination of  nonlinear, dissipation, dispersion, and focusing terms are derived. Especially,  the dissipation term depends on three factors, i.e., interfacial liquid  viscosity, liquid compressibility, and thermal conductivity of gas inside  bubbles; the thermal conduction is evaluated by using four types of temperature  gradient models.

METHODS:  Patients with a history of HIFU requesting consultation for stricture were  identified from 2010 to 2020. Demographic and prior treatment data were recorded.  Patients who presented for evaluation underwent retrograde cystoscopy, retrograde  urethrogram, voiding cystourethrogram, and antegrade cystoscopy through a  suprapubic tract. Patients who only had virtual consultation and did not present  for in-person evaluation, were followed longitudinally to assess long-term  outcomes and quality of life. RESULTS: Over the 10-year study period, 17 patients  were identified with a mean age of 65.8 years. Prior to initial consultation, a  total of 88% of patients had at least 1 failed surgical intervention at a mean of  45 months post-HIFU. The majority of patients (94%) had strictures that included  but were not necessarily limited to the prostatic urethra. Patients underwent  various treatments postevaluation, favoring endoscopic therapy (38%), and  proximal diversion (20%) at a mean follow-up of 68.2 ± 7.5 months. Only 38%  reported satisfaction with urinary symptoms. CONCLUSION: Urethral narrowing  post-HIFU appears to overwhelmingly involve the prostatic urethra. Patients  usually have a significant treatment burden over a prolonged period and are often  managed with repeated endoscopic treatment, extirpative prostatic surgery, or  urinary diversion as they have obstruction that is not amendable to urethral  reconstruction. Most patients with HIFU strictures experience a diminished QOL  due to persistent urinary symptoms.","2022-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","211-217","","","167","","Urology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

METHODS: PubMed, Embase,  Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched until  June 30, 2022. The ROBINS-I tool scale was used to evaluate quality of eligible  studies. Biochemical failure was defined according to the criteria used in each  raw study. The presence of any cancer on follow-up biopsy was classified as  ""positive biopsy"". Patients able to penetrate their partner without pharmacologic  support were rated potent. Meta-analysis was performed to evaluate functional  outcomes using R project. RESULTS: A total of 1861 patients in 15 eligible  studies were included. All studies were identified as moderate or high quality.  There were 1388 (74.6%) patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk PCa in 15  studies and 473 (25.4%) patients with high-risk PCa in 12 studies. The mean PSA  nadir postoperatively ranged from 0.20 to 1.90 ng/mL within average time of  1.9-12 months. Biochemical failure rates in all 15 studies ranged from 6.3% to  34% within average time of 1.9-60 months. Eleven studies reported the rates of  positive biopsy ranged from 3% to 29.7% within average time of 3-12 months  postoperatively. Based on the results of single-arm meta-analysis, the pooled  rates of any degree urinary incontinence, acute urinary retention, urinary tract  infections, and urethral stricture were 9.4% (95% CI: 6.1%-12.6%), 0.9% (95% CI:  0%-2%), 2.6% (95% CI: 0.8%-4.3%), and 4.3% (95% CI: 1.4%-7.1%), respectively. The  pooled rate of being potent after procedure in previously potent patients was  43.6% (95% CI: 27.3%-59.8%). The sensitivity analysis revealed all the pooled  results was relatively reliable. Egger's tests for the pooled results of acute  urinary retention (p = 0.0651) and potency (p = 0.6749) both did not show  significant publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that the combination  treatment of whole-gland HIFU and TURP could be applied for PCa patients. It  might have potential advantages of decreasing catheterization time and improving  urinary status. Prospective and comparative studies are needed to validate our  findings.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","988490","","","12","","Front Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Pan, Wang, Liu and Liu.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36313706  PMCID: PMC9597449","","","","high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation; meta-analysis; prostatic neoplasms; systematic review; transurethral resection of prostate; treatment outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)  ablation is a new method for the treatment of breast tumors, but there is a  problem of low ablation efficiency. Therefore, the improvement of HIFU efficiency  to combat breast cancer is immediately needed. This study aimed to describe a  novel anaerobic bacteria-mediated nanoplatform, comprising synergistic HIFU  therapy for breast cancer under guidance of ultrasound (US) and magnetic  resonance (MR) bimodal imaging. METHODS: The PFH@CL/Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles (NPs)  (Perfluorohexane (PFH) and superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIO, Fe(3)O(4)) with  cationic lipid (CL) NPs) were synthesized using the thin membrane hydration  method. The novel nanoplatform Bifidobacterium bifidum-mediated PFH@CL/Fe(3)O(4)  NPs were constructed by electrostatic adsorption. Thereafter, US and MR bimodal  imaging ability of B. bifidum-mediated PFH@CL/Fe(3)O(4) NPs was evaluated in  vitro and in vivo. Finally, the efficacy of HIFU ablation based on B.  bifidum-PFH@CL/Fe(3)O(4) NPs was studied. RESULTS: B. bifidum combined with  PFH@CL/Fe(3)O(4) NPs by electrostatic adsorption and enhanced the tumor targeting  ability of PFH@CL/Fe(3)O(4) NPs. US and MR bimodal imaging clearly displayed the  distribution of the bio-targeting nanoplatform in vivo. It was conducive for  accurate and effective guidance of HIFU synergistic treatment of tumors.  Furthermore, PFH@CL/Fe(3)O(4) NPs could form microbubbles by acoustic droplet  evaporation and promote efficiency of HIFU ablation under guidance of bimodal  imaging. CONCLUSION: A bio-targeting nanoplatform with high stability and good  physicochemical properties was constructed. The HIFU synergistic agent achieved  early precision imaging of tumors and promoted therapeutic effect, monitored by  US and MR bimodal imaging during the treatment process.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2943-2960","","","17","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Jiang et al.","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 35814614  PMCID: PMC9270014","","","","*Breast Neoplasms/pathology; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Nanoparticles/chemistry; Bifidobacterium bifidum; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Ultrasonography; cancer therapy; high-intensity focused ultrasound; imaging guidance; nanoparticles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focused ultrasound (FUS) use with and without microbubbles (MB) for investigation of the blood-nerve barrier (BNB) within the peripheral nervous  system (PNS) has been performed in this study. We evaluate the feasibility of BNB  opening in a rodent sciatic nerve model by direct vision FUS treatment and  provide preliminary results of magnetic resonance guided FUS (MRgFUS).Approach.  Twenty rodent bilateral sciatic nerves were investigated. Rodents were treated  using a benchtop FUS system to directly visualize nerve FUS studies. Definity MB,  Evans blue dye (EB) and latex micro beads were injected during studies. Selected  animals underwent further compound muscle action potential (CMAP) studies.  Sonication peak pressure (MPa), width, duty-cycle and duration as well as MB  concentration were varied to investigate effective pressure threshold. Further  preliminary MRgFUS studies were performed on selected animals.  Immunohistochemistry and histological analysis under florescent microscopy were  performed at termination of experiments to verify treatment outcomes.Main  results. Three ultrasound pressures and three microbubble concentrations at a  single sonication frequency (476.5 kHz) were performed under direct open  targeting. Histological analysis demonstrated nerve internal architecture  disruption at 1.2 MPa with 166.7μl kg(-1)while 0.3 MPa, with 40μl kg(-1)MB  concentration was the lower threshold for consistently observed disruption of the  BNB without anatomical microarchitecture disruption. EB leakage was confirmed at  the target region in histological evaluation of nerve following MB injection and  FUS sonication. Supra-harmonic emissions were detected during FUS exposures  following MB injection but not at baseline reference, indicating effective MB  response and stable cavitation. CMAP amplitudes showed delayed onset latency and  lower amplitudes in sonicated nerves compared to control nerves without evidence  of complete conduction block, suggesting a transient BNB disruption, while at  lower limit pressure subtle conduction changes were observed. In MRgFUS, targeted  nerves demonstrated further contrast agent leak as well as supra-harmonic  frequency detection.Significance. Opening of the BNB in the PNS was achieved  using FUS and MB in a rodent model. Ongoing work aims to refine FUS parameters  for drug delivery into the nerve after experimental transient BNB disruption.","2022-10-07","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","20","67","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Creative Commons Attribution license.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36055246","","","","*Blood-Brain Barrier/physiology; *Contrast Media; Animals; BNB: blood nerve-barrier; Blood-Nerve Barrier; Drug Delivery Systems/methods; Evans Blue; FUS: focused ultrasound; Latex; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Microbubbles; Sonication/methods; magnetic resonance-guided; microbubbles; sciatic nerve; sonication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RECENT FINDINGS: Unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy for both  essential and parkinsonian tremors is an approved and well established therapy.  Recent studies have focused on its long-term safety and efficacy as well as  technical advances for refining the approach. Moreover, ultrasound has expanded  its application in Parkinson's disease, with clinical trials successfully  targeting other brain regions like the subthalamic nucleus, the globus pallidus  and the pallidothalamic tract, providing benefits for features that thalamotomy  neglects. New indications, such as focal dystonia or neuropsychiatric conditions  (namely obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression) have also been explored,  with encouraging preliminary results. Finally, the application of ultrasound in  low-intensity modality allows other approaches like focal blood-brain barrier  opening and neuromodulation, which promise to be highly relevant in translational  research. SUMMARY: MRgFUS is a growing emergent technique. Its application in  clinical routine is becoming widely accepted as a therapeutic option. Novel  approaches and new potential applications are anticipated.","2022-08-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","525-535","","4","35","","Curr Opin Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
