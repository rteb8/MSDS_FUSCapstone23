HA filler injection is  generally recommended after MFU if combined treatment is required in a single  visit. However, data regarding the safe and optimal time of MFU treatment after  HA injection is still limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the  degree of HA loss when performing MFU treatment after dermal filler injection.  METHODS: Fourteen subjects were recruited in this pilot study. HA was injected  intradermally on four 2 × 2 cm areas at the abdomen (0.25 ml/site). Site A was  served as control whereas site B, C, D were treated with MFU using 1.5 mm  transducer at 60 min, Day 14, and Day 28 after the injection, respectively. All  experimental sites were biopsied using a 3-mm punch biopsy to evaluate the  histopathological profile at baseline and Day 56. Grading of the quantity of  retained HA was evaluated by a blinded experienced dermatopathologist. RESULTS:  All 14 subjects completed the study. One subject has been excluded due to the  poor quality of histopathologic slides. Seven subjects (53.9%) at site B and 6  subjects (46.2%) at site C had HA loss at Day 56 compared with baseline. The mean  HA grading at baseline and Day 56 was 3.7 vs. 2.8 (p < 0.001) at site B and 3.7  vs. 3.0 (p = 0.001) at site C, respectively. There was no statistical difference  between the mean HA grading at baseline and Day 56 at site D (3.7 vs. 3.3,  p = 0.073). No inflammation or granuloma was observed on Day 56 of the study.  CONCLUSIONS: MFU treatment after HA injection appears to be safe. However, some  degree of HA loss was observed if MFU treatment was done within 2 weeks after HA  injection.","2023-03","2024-03-06 17:09:53","2024-03-06T17:09:53Z","","792-797","","3","22","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis seeks  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HIFU in the treatment of benign thyroid  nodules. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched for  relevant studies from 1990 to 2021. Nine studies were included in the systematic  review and 6 in the meta-analysis. Pooled volume reduction rates (VRRs) at 3, 6  and 24 months after HIFU were assessed. RESULTS: This systematic review and  meta-analysis showed that pooled VRRs at 3, 6, and 24 months after HIFU were  42.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] 28.66-55.62, I2=91%), 53.51 (95% CI  36.78-70.25, I2=97%) and 46.89 (95% CI 18.87-74.92, I2=99%), respectively. There  was significant heterogeneity in the pooled VRRs at 3, 6 and 24 months after  HIFU. No studies recorded complete disappearance of the nodules. Common side  effects included pain, skin changes and oedema. There were no major complications  except for transient vocal cord paralysis and voice hoarseness (0.014%) and  transient Horner syndrome (0.5%).

METHODS:  We developed a new therapeutic strategy called low-power cumulative HIFU and  applied it to treat recurrent desmoid tumors. RESULTS: We retrospectively  collected data from 91 patients with recurrent desmoid tumors who underwent  low-power cumulative HIFU treatment after surgical treatment failure. The mean  ablation proportion of the HIFU treatment was 69.5%, and the objective response  rate was 47.3%. The 5-year estimated progression-free survival rate for these  patients was 69.3%.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 216  symptomatic uterine fibroids in 216 women were subjected to HIFU ablation from  October 2015 to March 2020. Baseline clinical and MR parameters acquired before  and after HIFU ablation were analyzed, and the NPVR was calculated accordingly.  Radiomics features were extracted using A.K. software on T2-weighted imaging  (T2WI). The minimum redundancy and maximum relevancy (mRMR) method were used to  refine the selected radiomics features. Then, multiple linear regression models,  the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Spearman's rank correlation and Bland-Altman  analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Conventional MRI combined with radiomics  revealed the signal intensity on T2WI (X(9)), enhancement degree on T1-weighted  imaging (T1WI) (X(11)), uterine fibroid location (X(4)),  wavelet_glszm_SizeZoneNonUniformity first order (X(12)) and  wavelet_HHH_firstorder_Skewness (X(13)) negatively affected the NPVR. The  resulting regression equation was NPVR = 104.030 - 11.886 × X(9) - 5.459 × X(11)  - 2.776 × X(4) - 0.20 × X(12) - 16.913 × X(13). The adjusted R(2) values of the  conventional MRI model and combined model were 0.385 and 0.408, respectively, and  the two fitted models were statistically significant (p < 0.05). No significant  differences were observed between the predicted NPVR value [81 (71, 91) %] of the  combined model and the actual NPVR value [89 (77, 97) %] (p > 0.05). In addition,  the predicted NPVR was correlated with the actual NPVR (r = 0.655, p < 0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: The efficiency of the combined model was better than that of the  conventional MRI model in predicting the NPVR following HIFU ablation for uterine  fibroids.

While early works in utilizing this technology have mainly focused on  maximizing the delivery of therapeutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the  potential therapeutic impact of FUS-induced controlled thermal and mechanical  stress to modulate anti-tumor immunity is becoming increasingly recognized.  OBJECTIVE: To better understand the roles of FUS-mediated thermal and mechanical  stress in promoting anti-tumor immunity in central nervous system tumors, we  performed a comprehensive literature review on focused ultrasound-mediated  immunomodulation and immunotherapy in brain tumors. METHODS: First, we summarize  the current clinical experience with immunotherapy. Then, we discuss the unique  and distinct immunomodulatory effects of the FUS-mediated thermal and mechanical  stress in the brain tumor-immune microenvironment. Finally, we highlight recent  findings that indicate that its combination with immune adjuvants can promote  robust responses in brain tumors. RESULTS: Along with the rapid advancement of  FUS technologies into recent clinical trials, this technology through  mild-hyperthermia, thermal ablation, mechanical perturbation mediated by  microbubbles, and histotripsy each inducing distinct vascular and immunological  effects, is offering the unique opportunity to improve immunotherapeutic  trafficking and convert immunologically ""cold"" tumors into immunologically ""hot""  ones that are prone to generate prolonged anti-tumor immune responses.  CONCLUSIONS: While FUS technology is clearly accelerating concepts for new  immunotherapeutic combinations, additional parallel efforts to detail rational  therapeutic strategies supported by rigorous preclinical studies are still in  need to leverage potential synergies of this technology with immune adjuvants.  This work will accelerate the discovery and clinical implementation of new  effective FUS immunotherapeutic combinations for brain tumor patients.","2022-04","2024-03-06 17:09:32","2024-03-06T17:09:32Z","","221-236","","2","157","","J Neurooncol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

It  changes the firing properties of neurons through the current generated by focused  ultrasound and a static magnetic field. Spike-frequency adaptation is an  important dynamic characteristic of neural information processing. METHODS: To  address the effects of TMAS on neural spike-frequency adaptation, this study  employs some ultrasound and magnetic field parameters, such as magnetic flux  density, ultrasonic intensity, fundamental ultrasonic frequency, modulation  frequency, and duty cycle. Using these different ultrasound and magnetic field  parameters, membrane potential curves, spike-frequency curves, and adapted onset  spike-frequency curves are exhibited and analyzed. RESULTS: The results show that  spike-frequency adaptation is strongly dependent on ultrasonic intensity and  magnetic flux density and is rarely affected by other parameters. However,  modulation frequency and duty cycle influence membrane potentials and spike  frequencies to some degree. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the mechanism of the  effects of TMAS on neural spike-frequency adaptation and serves as theoretical  guidance for TMAS experiments.","2022-05-02","2024-03-06 17:09:27","2024-03-06T17:09:27Z","","26","","1","23","","BMC Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

The CNS is separated and protected by a unique system of  brain and blood vessel cells which together prevent most bloodborne therapeutics  from entering the brain tumor microenvironment (TME). Recently, great strides  have been made through microbubble (MB) ultrasound contrast agents in conjunction  with ultrasound energy to locally increase the permeability of brain vessels and  modulate the brain TME. As we elaborate in this review, this physical method can  effectively deliver a wide range of anticancer agents, including  chemotherapeutics, antibodies, and nanoparticle drug conjugates across a range of  preclinical brain tumors, including high grade glioma (glioblastoma), diffuse  intrinsic pontine gliomas, and brain metastasis. Moreover, recent evidence  suggests that this technology can promote the effective delivery of novel  immunotherapeutic agents, including immune check-point inhibitors and chimeric  antigen receptor T cells, among others. With early clinical studies demonstrating  safety, and several Phase I/II trials testing the preclinical findings underway,  this technology is making firm steps towards shaping the future treatments of  primary and metastatic brain cancer.

This study aims to apply focused ultrasound on the spinal cord to modulate  the descending pathways in a non-invasive fashion. The application of  trans-spinal focused ultrasound (tsFUS) was examined on the motor deficit mouse  model. tsFUS was achieved using a single-element focused ultrasound transducer  operating at 3 MHz. The sonication was performed on anesthetized 6 week-old mice  targeting T12 and L3 vertebrae. The effect was analyzed by comparing  electromyography responses from the hindlimb induced by electrical stimulation of  the motor cortex. Further, the mouse model with the Harmaline-induced essential  tremor (ET) was selected to investigate the potential clinical application of  tsFUS. The safety was verified by histological assessment. Sonication at the T12  area inhibited motor response, while sonication over the L3 region provided  signal enhancement. Sonication of T12 of the ET mouse also showed the ability of  ultrasound to suppress tremors. Meanwhile, the histological examination did not  show any abnormalities with the highest applied acoustic pressure. In this work,  a non-invasive motor signal modulation was achieved using tsFUS. Moreover, the  results showed the ability of focused ultrasound to manage tremors in a safe  manner. This study provides a stepping stone for the trans-spinal application of  focused ultrasound to motor-related disorders.","2022","2024-03-06 17:09:15","2024-03-06T17:09:15Z","","314-320","","","30","","IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35108206","","","","*Motor Cortex/physiology; Animals; Efferent Pathways; Electromyography/methods; Hindlimb/physiology; Humans; Mice; Spine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The odds ratio (OR) and 95%  confidence interval (CI) for each study were calculated and then pooled with  fixed effects model or random effects model. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup  analyses were conducted. A publication bias was also evaluated. RESULTS: After  literature selection, eleven RCTs involving 803 patients were included in this  meta-analysis. This meta-analysis revealed that group A was associated with an  increased 6-month OS rate (OR = 0.20), 12-month OS rate (OR = 0.23), 24-month OS  rate (OR = 0.32), and overall response rate (WHO criterion, OR = 0.22; RECIST  criterion, OR = 0.30). Furthermore, subgroup analyses showed no bias in the  result. Given the limited number of studies that reported major complications, no  additional meta-analysis of complication was conducted. Despite no special  treatment, any complication following HIFU treatment was found to subside within  3-7 days. CONCLUSION: TACE in combination with HIFU is associated with increased  OS and tumor response in intermediate and advanced HCC. Current evidence supports  the use of HIFU after TACE treatment in intermediate and advanced HCC.","2022","2024-03-06 17:09:12","2024-03-06T17:09:12Z","","797349","","","12","","Front Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Wang, Ma, Wang, Shi, Zhang, Chen, Gong and Bai.","","","","","","PMID: 35419281  PMCID: PMC8999843","","","","combination; hepatocellular carcinoma; hepatocellularCarcinoma; high-intensity focused ultrasound; meta-analysis; transcatheter arterial chemoembolization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many  studies have demonstrated the ability of tFUS to elicit transient changes in  neural responses. However, the ability of tFUS to induce sustained changes need  to be carefully examined. In this study, we use the long-term potentiation/long  term depression (LTP/LTD) model in the rat hippocampus, the medial perforant path  (mPP) to dentate gyrus (DG) pathway, to explore whether tFUS is capable of  encoding frequency specific information to induce plasticity. Single-element  focused transducers were used for tFUS stimulation with ultrasound fundamental  frequency of 0.5 MHz and nominal focal distance of 38 mm tFUS stimulation is  directed to mPP. Measurement of synaptic connectivity is achieved through the  slope of field excitatory post synaptic potentials (fEPSPs), which are elicited  using bipolar electrical stimulation electrodes and recorded at DG using  extracellular electrodes to quantify degree of plasticity. We applied pulsed tFUS  stimulation with total duration of 5 min, with 5 levels of pulse repetition  frequencies each administered at 50 Hz sonication frequency at the mPP. Baseline  fEPSP is recorded 10 min prior, and 30+ minutes after tFUS administration. In  N = 16 adult wildtype rats, we observed sustained depression of fEPSP slope after  5 min of tFUS focused at the presynaptic field mPP. Across all PRFs, no  significant difference in maximum fEPSP slope change was observed, average tFUS  induced depression level was observed at 19.6%. When compared to low frequency  electrical stimulation (LFS) of 1 Hz delivered to the mPP, the sustained changes  induced by tFUS stimulation show no statistical difference to LFS for up to  24 min after tFUS stimulation. When both the maximum depression effects and the  duration of sustained effects are both taken into account, PRF 3 kHz can induce  significantly larger effects than other PRFs tested. tFUS stimulation is measured  with a spatial-peak pressure amplitude of 99 kPa, translating to an estimation of  0.43 °C temperature increase when assuming no loss of heat. The results suggest  the ability of tFUS to encode sustained changes in synaptic connectivity through  mechanism which are unlikely to involve thermal changes.","2022-04","2024-03-06 17:09:09","2024-03-06T17:09:09Z","","352-359","","2","15","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

The aim of this  study is to explore the feasibility of tFUS stimulation for analgesia  application. METHODS: 50 l of 3% formalin solution was injected into the rats  left hindpaw to build a pain model, and then the local field potential (LFP)  activities of the dorsal horn were tracked after a recording electrode was placed  in the spinal cord. Rats were randomly divided into two groups: control group and  tFUS group. At the 30th minute after formalin injection, tFUS (US-650 kHz, PD = 1  ms, PRF = 100 Hz, 691 mW/cm2) was conducted to stimulate the periaqueductal gray  (PAG) for 5 minutes (on 5 s and off 5 s) in tFUS group, but there was no  treatment in control group. In addition, the analgesia mechanism (LFP recording  from the PAG) and safety assessment (histology analysis) were carried out.  RESULTS: The tFUS stimulation of the PAG can suppress effectively the nociceptive  activity generated by formalin. The findings of the underlying mechanism  exploration indicated that the tFUS stimulation was able to activate the PAG  directly without causing significant temperature change and tissue injury.

We summarize 1-year follow-up  results focusing on clinical and safety parameters and impacts on quality of  life. METHODS: A total of 45 patients with severe, medication-refractory ET were  treated with tcMRgFUS thalamotomy. 37 patients completed the clinical follow-up  of 12 months. Tremor severity, disability and quality of life were measured using  the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST), surface electromyography, the  Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST) and the Short-Form-36  questionnaire (SF-36). Depressive symptoms and cognitive function were assessed  using standardized questionnaires. Electrophysiological measurements were  conducted to evaluate possible effects on central motor and sensory pathways.  RESULTS: 1 year after tcMRgFUS the mean tremor improvement on a hand-specific  subscore of the CRST was 82%. The QUEST and SF-36 revealed an improvement of  mental quality of life, especially in activities of daily living and psychosocial  function; depressive symptoms decreased significantly. There was no worsening of  cognitive function overt within the self-rating questionnaire; no prolongation of  sensory evoked potentials or central motor conduction time occurred. Side effects  were mostly classified as mild (78%) and transient (62%). CONCLUSIONS: TcMRgFUS  for severe tremor has a distinct impact on quality of life and neuropsychological  symptoms. Self-assessments of cognitive function revealed stable outcomes 1 year  after tcMRgFUS. No prolongation of sensory or motor conduction time were found in  neurophysiology measures.

To determine the feasibility of in  vivo transcranial histotripsy, tcMRgHt treatment was delivered to eight pigs  using a 700-kHz, 128-element, MR-compatible phased-array transducer inside a 3-T  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.

The MR-evident lesions were well  confined within the targeted volume, without evidence of excessive brain edema or  hemorrhage outside of the target zone. Histology revealed tissue homogenization  in the ablation zones with a sharp demarcation between destroyed and unaffected  tissue, which correlated well with the radiographic treatment zones on MRI.

The efficacy of systemic therapies for GBM  is greatly limited by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which  prevents drug penetration and accumulation in regions of infiltrative tumour, as  represented in a consistent portion of GBM lesions. Focused ultrasound (FUS) - a  technique that uses low-frequency ultrasound waves to induce targeted temporary  disruption of the BBB - promises to improve survival outcomes by enhancing drug  delivery and accumulation to infiltrating tumour regions. In this review we  discuss the current state of preclinical investigations using FUS to enhance  delivery of systemic therapies to intracranial neoplasms. We highlight critical  methodological inconsistencies that are hampering clinical translation of FUS and  we provide guiding principles for future preclinical studies. Particularly, we  focus our attention on the importance of the selection of clinically relevant  animal models and to the standardization of methods for FUS delivery, which will  be paramount to the successful clinical translation of this promising technology  for treatment in GBM patients. We also discuss how preclinical FUS research can  benefit the development of GBM immunotherapies.","2022-05","2024-03-06 17:08:56","2024-03-06T17:08:56Z","","443-463","","","345","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

Gastrodin (GAS) is a phenolic glycoside extracted from the  traditional Chinese herb-Gastrodia elata-and has been reported as a potential  therapeutic agent for AD. However, its efficiency is reduced for AD patients due  to its limited BBB permeability. Studies have demonstrated the feasibility of  opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via focused ultrasound (FUS) to overcome  the obstacles preventing medicines from blood flow into the brain tissue. We  explored the therapeutic potential of FUS-mediated BBB opening combined with GAS  in an AD-like mouse model induced by unilateral intracerebroventricular (ICV)  injection of Aβ (1-42). Mice were divided into 5 groups: control, untreated, GAS,  FUS and FUS+GAS. Combined treatment (FUS+GAS) rather than single intervention  (GAS or FUS) alleviated memory deficit and neuropathology of AD-like mice. The  time that mice spent in the novel arm was prolonged in the Y-maze test after  15-day intervention, and the waste-cleaning effect was remarkably increased.  Contents of Aβ, tau, and P-tau in the observed (also the targeted) hippocampus  were reduced. BDNF, synaptophysin (SYN), and PSD-95 were upregulated in the  combined group. Overall, our results demonstrate that FUS-mediated BBB opening  combined with GAS injection exerts the potential to alleviate memory deficit and  neuropathology in the AD-like experimental mouse model, which may be a novel  strategy for AD treatment.","2022","2024-03-06 17:08:54","2024-03-06T17:08:54Z","","5241449","","","2022","","Neural Plast","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Kaixuan Luo et al.","","","","","","PMID: 35069727  PMCID: PMC8776436","","","","Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy; Animals; Benzyl Alcohols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects/pathology; Brain/drug effects/*pathology; Combined Modality Therapy; Disease Models, Animal; Glucosides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Maze Learning/drug effects; Memory Disorders/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy; Mice; Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Ultrasonography, Interventional/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatment efficacy and side-effects  were assessed directly after treatment and at follow-up 4-15 weeks after  treatment. RESULTS: The treatment showed positive results in 96.3% of the cases.  About 68.5% of the cases were classified as complete response and 27.8% of the  cases as partial response. Two cases (3.7%) did not respond to treatment and were  classified as stable condition. No subjects experienced worsening of their  condition, and no treatment received the classification of progressive condition.  Side effects were primarily redness in the treatment area due to superficial  telangiectasia, mild scarring, and persisting and slow-healing lichen planus-like  keratosis. No adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: HIFU is concluded to be a  safe and efficient skin treatment for seborrheic keratoses. It has advantages  over conventional treatments that can lead to pain during treatment and scarring  after healing.","2022","2024-03-06 17:08:46","2024-03-06T17:08:46Z","","145-156","","","15","","Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Calik et al.","","","","","","PMID: 35125879  PMCID: PMC8808045","","","","HIFU; dermatology; dermoscopy; seborrheic warts; skin tumor; solar lentigo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper improves the 2-step aberration correction (AC) method that  has been previously presented and develops an AC workflow that fits in the  clinical environment, in which the computed tomography (CT)-based analytical  approach was first implemented, followed by a cavitation-based approach using the  shockwaves from the acoustic cavitation emission (ACE).Approach:A 700 kHz,  360-element hemispherical transducer array capable of transmit-and-receive on all  channels was used to transcranially generate histotripsy-induced cavitation and  acquire ACE shockwaves. For CT-AC, two ray-tracing models were investigated: a  forward ray-tracing model (transducer-to-focus) in the open-source software  Kranion, and an in-house backward ray-tracing model (focus-to-transducer)  accounting for refraction and the sound speed variation in skulls.  Co-registration was achieved by aligning the skull CT data to the skull surface  map reconstructed using the acoustic pulse-echo method. For ACE-AC, the ACE  signals from the collapses of generated bubbles were aligned by cross-correlation  to estimate the corresponding time delays.Main results:The performance of the  2-step method was tested with 3 excised human calvariums placed at 2 different  locations in the transducer array. Results showed that the 2-step AC achieved  90 ± 7% peak focal pressure compared to the gold standard hydrophone correction.  It also reduced the focal shift from 0.84 to 0.30 mm and the focal volume from  10.6 to 2.0 mm(3)on average compared to the no AC cases.Significance:The 2-step  AC yielded better refocusing compared to either CT-AC or ACE-AC alone and can be  implemented in real-time for transcranial histotripsy brain therapy.","2022-06-10","2024-03-06 17:08:45","2024-03-06T17:08:45Z","","","","12","67","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35609619","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Skull/diagnostic imaging; Acoustics; Brain; Humans; Sound; Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods; aberration correction; cavitation shockwaves; computed tomography; histotripsy; transcranial ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, recent work has consistently  implicated altered cortical modulation by deep brain structures (e.g., the  thalamus and the basal ganglia) following brain damage in the arising of, and  recovery from, DOCs. The (re)emergence of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)  neuromodulation may provide a means to selectively modulate the activity of deep  brain structures noninvasively for the study and treatment of DOCs. This  technique is unique in its combination of relatively high spatial precision and  noninvasive implementation. Given the consistent implication of the thalamus in  DOCs and prior results inducing behavioral recovery through invasive thalamic  stimulation, here we applied ultrasound to the central thalamus in 11 acute DOC  patients, measured behavioral responsiveness before and after sonication, and  applied functional MRI during sonication. With respect to behavioral  responsiveness, we observed significant recovery in the week following thalamic  LIFU compared with baseline. With respect to functional imaging, we found  decreased BOLD signals in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia during LIFU  compared with baseline. In addition, we also found a relationship between altered  connectivity of the sonicated thalamus and the degree of recovery observed  post-LIFU.","2022-03-23","2024-03-06 17:08:44","2024-03-06T17:08:44Z","","","","4","12","","Brain Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 35447960  PMCID: PMC9032970","","","","acute; deep brain stimulation; disorders of consciousness; neuromodulation; non-invasive; subcortex; thalamus; treatment; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Sixty-one patients (62 eyes) with primary and  secondary glaucoma were enrolled to undergo UCP. The primary outcome measures  were intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, success rates, glaucoma medication use  and visual acuity after UCP. An IOP reduction of 20% compared to the baseline  value without re-intervention was considered a successful treatment. Complete  success was defined as cessation of antiglaucoma medications. Secondary outcome  measures included intraoperative and postoperative complications. Measurements  were performed preoperatively and at the first week, and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30  and 36 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients (41 eyes) were  evaluated 36-month after UCP. The mean ± SD values of IOP preoperatively at  1 day, 1 week, 1; 3; 6; 12; 18; 24; 30 and 36 months postoperatively were  22.7 ± 5.0 mmHg, 17.1 ± 4.2 mmHg (p < 0.001), 15.7 ± 4.8 mmHg (p < 0.001),  18.8 ± 4.8 mmHg (p < 0.001), 17.3 ± 3.7 mmHg (p < 0.001), 16.9 ± 3.2 mmHg  (p < 0.001), 16.6 ± 2.7 mmHg (p < 0.001), 16.3 ± 3.0 mmHg (p < 0.001),  15.8 ± 3.4 mmHg (p < 0.001), 15.3 ± 2.1 mmHg (p < 0.001) and 16.3 ± 3.0 mmHg  (p < 0.001), respectively. The mean IOP at the last follow-up was reduced by  28.5%. The qualified success rate was 64.0%. All patients at 36-month follow-up  visit required the use of antiglaucoma medications - none of the patients  achieved complete success. The decrease in the number of antiglaucoma medications  was statistically significant at each follow-up visit compared to the baseline.  Choroid detachment was observed in three patients (4.8%), while macular oedema  was observed in three patients (4.8%) after the procedure.

A  large variety of mechanophores have been investigated, with applications focusing  on functional materials, such as strain/stress sensors, nanolithography, and  self-healing polymers, among others. The responses of engineered mechanophores,  such as light emittance, change in fluorescence, and generation of free radicals  (FRs), have potential for bioimaging and therapy. However, the biomedical  applications of mechanophores are not well explored. Herein, we report an  in vitro demonstration of an FR-generating mechanophore embedded in biocompatible  hydrogels for noninvasive cancer therapy. Controlled by high-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU), a clinically proven therapeutic technique, mechanophores were  activated with spatiotemporal precision to generate FRs that converted to  reactive oxygen species (ROS) to effectively kill tumor cells. The mechanophore  hydrogels exhibited no cytotoxicity under physiological conditions. Upon  activation with HIFU sonication, the therapeutic efficacies in killing in vitro  murine melanoma and breast cancer tumor cells were comparable with lethal doses  of H(2)O(2) This process demonstrated the potential for mechanophore-integrated  HIFU combination as a noninvasive cancer treatment platform, named  ""mechanochemical dynamic therapy"" (MDT). MDT has two distinct advantages over  other noninvasive cancer treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and  sonodynamic therapy (SDT). 1) MDT is ultrasound based, with larger penetration  depth than PDT. 2) MDT does not rely on sonosensitizers or the acoustic  cavitation effect, both of which are necessary for SDT. Taking advantage of the  strengths of mechanophores and HIFU, MDT can provide noninvasive treatments for  diverse cancer types.","2022-01-25","2024-03-06 17:08:39","2024-03-06T17:08:39Z","","","","4","119","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

The present study used a recently developed  composite hydrogel composed of a fibrin matrix and phase-shift emulsion, termed  an acoustically responsive scaffold (ARS), to investigate effects of local  mechanical properties on breast cancer cell signaling. Treatment of ARSs with  focused ultrasound drives acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) in a  spatiotemporally controlled manner, inducing local compaction and stiffening of  the fibrin matrix adjacent to the matrix-bubble interface. Combining ARSs and  live single cell imaging of triple-negative breast cancer cells, it is discovered  that both basal and growth-factor stimulated activities of protein kinase B (also  known as Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), two major kinases  driving cancer progression, negatively correlate with increasing distance from  the ADV-induced bubble both in vitro and in a mouse model. Together, these data  demonstrate that local changes in ECM compaction regulate Akt and ERK signaling  in breast cancer and support further applications of the novel ARS technology to  analyze spatial and temporal effects of ECM mechanics on cell signaling and  cancer biology.","2022-05","2024-03-06 17:08:27","2024-03-06T17:08:27Z","","e2101672","","10","11","","Adv Healthc Mater","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","","","","","","PMID: 35106975  PMCID: PMC9117464","","","","*Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Akt; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; ERK; Fibrin; Humans; Mice; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal Transduction; Volatilization; fibrin; mechanobiology; phase-shift emulsions; triple-negative breast cancer; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gambogic acid (GA) is widely used in tumor chemotherapy. However, GA has poor water solubility, low  bioavailability, and difficult permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB),  leading to poor efficacy against brain tumors. In our study, we developed  negatively charged GA-loaded PLGA nanobubbles [GA/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)  (PLGA)] and conjugated them onto the surface of cationic lipid microbubbles  (CMBs) through electrostatic interactions.

To address this limitation, we engineer therapeutic bacteria  to be controlled by focused ultrasound, a form of energy that can be applied  noninvasively to specific anatomical sites such as solid tumors.

However, locating the structure may be difficult as it is not visible with conventional imaging methods; therefore, surgical procedures typically use indirect calculations correlated with clinical and intraoperative neurophysiological findings. Current ablative surgical procedures such as Gamma-Knife thalamotomy and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound require new alternatives for locating the Vim nucleus. In this review, we compare Vim nucleus location for the treatment of tremor using stereotactic procedures versus direct location by means of tractography. DISCUSSION: The most widely used cytoarchitectonic definition of the Vim nucleus is that established by Schaltenbrand and Wahren. There is a well-defined limit between the motor and the sensory thalamus; Vim neurons respond to passive joint movements and are synchronous with peripheral tremor. The most frequently used stereotactic coordinates for the Vim nucleus are based on indirect calculations referencing the mid-commissural line and third ventricle, which vary between patients. Recent studies suggest that the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract is an optimal target for controlling tremor, citing a clinical improvement; however, this has not yet been corroborated. CONCLUSIONS: Visualisation of the cerebello-rubro-thalamic pathway by tractography may help in locating the Vim nucleus. The technique has several limitations, and the method requires standardisation to obtain more precise results. The utility of direct targeting by tractography over indirect targeting for patients with tremor remains to be demonstrated in the long-term.","2020-01","2024-03-06 17:00:02","2024-03-06T17:00:02Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31917004","","","","*Deep Brain Stimulation/methods; *Essential Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Dentato-rubro-thalamic pathway; Essential tremor; Haz dentatorrubrotalámico; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Núcleo ventralis intermedius; Talamotomía; Temblor esencial; Thalamotomy; Thalamus; Thalamus/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Tractografía; Tractography; Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Tálamo; Ventralis intermedius nucleus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The success rates were 77.1% (54/70) and 48.6%  (34/70), while the failure rates were 22.9% (16/70) and 2.9% (2/70) at the 12th  and 24th months postoperatively, respectively. The cumulative probabilities of  success were 70.0% (± 5.5%) and 47.1% (± 6.0%) at the 12th and 24th months  postoperatively, respectively. The most common complications were anterior  chamber reaction (24.3%), cataract development/progression (18.6%),  hypotony/choroidal detachment (4.3%), phthisis bulbi (1.4%) and aqueous  misdirection (1.4%). CONCLUSIONS: UCP is an effective treatment modality to  control IOP and decrease the burden of antiglaucoma medications in eyes with  previously failed glaucoma surgery. Monitoring and counseling of possible  postoperative complications are needed.","2022-08","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1601-1610","","4","11","","Ophthalmol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Information on the importance of handheld focused  ultrasound for cardiac evaluation in these patients is scarce. This study  investigated the utility of a handheld echocardiography device in hospitalised  patients with COVID-19 in diagnosing cardiac pathologies and predicting the  composite end point of in-hospital death, mechanical ventilation, shock, and  acute decompensated heart failure. METHODS: From April 28 through July 27, 2020,  consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 underwent evaluation with the use of  handheld ultrasound (Vscan Extend with Dual Probe; GE Healthcare) within 48 hours  of admission. The patients were divided into 2 groups: ""normal"" and ""abnormal""  echocardiogram, as defined by biventricular systolic dysfunction/enlargement or  moderate/severe valvular regurgitation/stenosis. RESULTS: Among 102 patients, 26  (25.5%) had abnormal echocardiograms. They were older with more comorbidities and  more severe presenting symptoms compared with the group with normal  echocardiograms. The prevalences of the composite outcome among low- and  high-risk patients (oxygen saturation < 94%) were 3.1% and 27.1%, respectively.  Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an abnormal  echocardiogram at presentation was independently associated with the composite  end point (odds ratio 6.19, 95% confidence interval 1.50-25.57; P = 0.012).  CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal echocardiogram in COVID-19 infection settings is  associated with a higher burden of medical comorbidities and independently  predicts major adverse end points. Handheld focused echocardiography can be used  as an important ""rule-out"" tool among high-risk patients with COVID-19 and should  be integrated into their routine admission evaluation. However, its routine use  among low-risk patients is not recommended.","2022-03","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","338-346","","3","38","","Can J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

"ZXWQZIYD","videoRecording","2022","Chang, Stephano J.; Mitchell, Ruth; Hukin, Juliette; Singhal, Ash","Treatment-responsive Holmes tremor in a child with low-pressure hydrocephalus: video case report and systematic review of the literature.","","","","","","OBJECTIVE: Holmes tremor (HT) is a rare and debilitating movement disorder comprising both rest and action tremor, and it is known for its resistance to  treatment. Its most common causes include ischemic or hemorrhagic insults and  trauma. Mechanistically, the combined rest and action tremor is thought to  require a double lesion of both the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and the  dentatorubrothalamic pathways, often near the midbrain where both pathways  converge. The aim of this study was to characterize HT as a presenting sign in  cases of hydrocephalus and to discuss potential pathomechanisms, clinical  presentations, and treatment options. METHODS: MEDLINE and Web of Science were  searched for cases of HT with hydrocephalus from database inception to August  2021, and these were compiled along with the authors' own unique case of  treatment-responsive HT in a child with low-pressure obstructive hydrocephalus  secondary to a tectal tumor. Patient characteristics, presenting signs/symptoms,  potential precipitating factors, interventions, and patient outcomes were  recorded. RESULTS: Nine patients were identified including the authors' video  case report. All patients had a triventriculomegaly pattern with at least a  component of obstructive hydrocephalus, and 4 patients were identified as having  low-pressure hydrocephalus. Parinaud's syndrome and bradykinesia were the most  commonly associated signs. Levodopa and CSF diversion were the most commonly used  and effective treatments for HT in this population. This review was not  registered and did not receive any funding. CONCLUSIONS: HT is a poorly  understood and probably underrecognized presentation of hydrocephalus that is  difficult to treat, limiting the strength of the evidence in this review.  Treatment options include CSF diversion, antiparkinsonian agents, antiepileptic  agents, deep brain stimulation, and MR-guided focused ultrasound, and aim toward  the nigrostriatal and dentatorubrothalamic pathways hypothesized to be involved  in its pathophysiology.","2022-05-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","","29","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","DOI: 10.3171/2021.12.PEDS21539 ISSN: 1933-0715 1933-0707 Issue: 5 Journal Abbreviation: J Neurosurg Pediatr Pages: 520-527 Publication Title: Journal of neurosurgery.

At  the focal spot of the focused ultrasound, with the couple of acoustic and  electric fields, high-frequency acoustoelectric (HF AE) signal is generated.  Because the brain is a volume conductor, HF AE signal can be detected in other  brain cortex. The processing of HF AE signal is critical for improving decoding  precision, further improving the spatial resolution performance of ABI. This  study investigates the processing network of HF AE signal in the living rat  brain.Approach.When HF AE generated on the left primary visual cortex (V1-L),  low-frequency (LF) electroencephalography and HF AE signals on different cortex  were recorded at the same time. Firstly, AE signal on different sides of the  brain cortex were compared, including prefrontal cortex (FrA) and primary  somatosensory cortex (S1FL). Then, we constructed and analyzed functional  networks of two signals.Main results.In the same cortex, HF AE signal on the  right side had stronger intensity. And compared with LF networks, HF AE network  had larger global efficiency and shorter characteristic path length, denoting the  stronger processing and transmission of AE signal. Additionally, in HF AE  network, the node had significantly increased local properties and the connection  were concentrated in the occipital lobe, reflecting the occipital lobe plays an  important role in the processing.Significance.Experiment results demonstrate  that, compared with LF network, HF AE network is more efficient and had stronger  transmission capabilities. And the connection of HF AE network is concentrated in  the occipital lobe. This work preliminarily reveals the HF AE signal processing,  which is significant for improving the ABI quality and provides a new insight for  understanding the brain HF signal.","2022-09-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","5","19","","J Neural Eng","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36044882","","","","*Brain Mapping/methods; *Electroencephalography/methods; Animals; Brain/physiology; Cerebral Cortex; EEG; Rats; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; acoustoelectric brain imaging; acoustoelectric signal; high-frequency; processing network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, effectively targeting tau in  the brain remains a considerable challenge due to the restrictive nature of the  blood-brain barrier (BBB), which excludes an estimated >99% of peripherally  administered antibodies. However, their transport across the BBB can be  facilitated by a novel modality, low-intensity scanning ultrasound used in  combination with intravenously injected microbubbles (SUS(+MB)). We have  previously shown that SUS(+MB)-mediated delivery of a tau-specific antibody in a  single-chain (scFv) format to tau transgenic mice enhanced brain and neuronal  uptake and subsequently, reduced tau pathology and improved behavioural outcomes  to a larger extent than either scFv or SUS(+MB) on its own. Here we generated a  novel tau-specific monoclonal antibody, RNF5, and validated it in its IgG format  in the presence or absence of SUS(+MB) by treating K369I tau transgenic K3 mice  once weekly for 12 weeks. We found that both RNF5 and SUS(+MB) treatments on  their own significantly reduced tau pathology. In the combination group  (RNF5 + SUS(+MB)), however, despite increased antibody localization in the brain,  there were no further reductions in tau pathology when compared to RNF5 treatment  alone. Furthermore, following SUS(+MB), RNF5 accumulated heavily within cells  across the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, that were negative for MAP2  and p-tau, suggesting that SUS(+MB) may not facilitate enhanced RNF5 engagement  of intraneuronal tau. Overall, our new findings reveal the complexities of  combining tau immunotherapy with SUS(+MB) and challenge the view that this is a  straight-forward approach.","2022-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","634-648","","","349","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

The progression and management of tremor in PD can be challenging, as  response to dopaminergic agents might be relatively poor, particularly in  patients with tremor-dominant PD compared to the akinetic/rigid subtype. In this  review, we aim to highlight recent advances in the underlying pathogenesis and  treatment modalities for tremor in PD. METHODS: A structured literature search  through Embase was conducted using the terms ""Parkinson's Disease"" AND ""tremor""  OR ""etiology"" OR ""management"" OR ""drug resistance"" OR ""therapy"" OR  ""rehabilitation"" OR ""surgery."" After initial screening, eligible articles were  selected with a focus on published literature in the last 10 years. DISCUSSION:  The underlying pathophysiology of tremor in PD remains complex and incompletely  understood. Neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the retrorubral area, in  addition to high-power neural oscillations in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical  circuit and the basal ganglia, play a major role. Levodopa is the first-line  therapeutic option for all motor symptoms, including tremor. The addition of  dopamine agonists or anticholinergics can lead to further tremor reduction.  Botulinum toxin injection is an effective alternative for patients with  pharmacological-resistant tremor who are not seeking advanced therapies. Deep  brain stimulation is the most well-established advanced therapy owing to its  long-term efficacy, reversibility, and effectiveness in other motor symptoms and  fluctuations. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound is a promising  modality, which has the advantage of being incisionless. Cortical and peripheral  electrical stimulation are non-invasive innovatory techniques that have  demonstrated good efficacy in suppressing intractable tremor.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","29","","","12","","Tremor Other Hyperkinet Mov (N Y)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright: © 2022 The Author(s).","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36211804  PMCID: PMC9504742","","","","*Botulinum Toxins; *Parkinson Disease/drug therapy/therapy; Cholinergic Antagonists; DBS; Dopamine Agents/therapeutic use; Dopamine Agonists; Humans; Levodopa; Levodopa-resistant; Parkinson’s Disease; Tremor; Tremor/drug therapy/therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, locating the structure may be  difficult as it is not visible with conventional imaging methods; therefore,  surgical procedures typically use indirect calculations correlated with clinical  and intraoperative neurophysiological findings. Current ablative surgical  procedures such as Gamma-Knife thalamotomy and magnetic resonance-guided focused  ultrasound require new alternatives for locating the VIM nucleus. In this review,  we compare VIM nucleus location for the treatment of tremor using stereotactic  procedures versus direct location by means of tractography. DISCUSSION: The most  widely used cytoarchitectonic definition of the VIM nucleus is that established  by Schaltenbrand and Wahren. There is a well-defined limit between the motor and  the sensory thalamus; VIM neurons respond to passive joint movements and are  synchronous with peripheral tremor. The most frequently used stereotactic  coordinates for the VIM nucleus are based on indirect calculations referencing  the mid-commissural line and third ventricle, which vary between patients. Recent  studies suggest that the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract is an optimal target for  controlling tremor, citing a clinical improvement; however, this has not yet been  corroborated. CONCLUSIONS: Visualisation of the cerebello-rubro-thalamic pathway  by tractography may help in locating the VIM nucleus. The technique has several  limitations, and the method requires standardisation to obtain more precise  results. The utility of direct targeting by tractography over indirect targeting  for patients with tremor remains to be demonstrated in the long-term.","2022-10","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","691-699","","8","37","","Neurologia (Engl Ed)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Sociedad Española de Neurología.

Transcranial ultrasonic thermal  monitoring is an attractive alternative. Furthermore, using the therapeutic FUS  transducer itself for this task is highly desirable. Nonetheless, such  application is challenged by massive skull-induced signal attenuation and  aberrations. This study examined the feasibility of implementing the Golay-coded  excitations (CoE) for temperature monitoring in bovine brain samples in the range  of 35 °C-43 °C (hyperthermia). Feasibility was assessed using computer  simulations, water-based phantoms, and ex vivo bovine brain white-matter samples.  The samples were gradually heated to about 45 °C and sonicated during cool down  with a 1-MHz therapeutic FUS implementing Golay CoE. Initially, a calibration  curve correlating the normalized time-of-flight (TOF) changes and the temperature  was generated. Next, a bovine bone was positioned between the FUS and the brain  samples, and the scanning process was repeated for different fresh samples. The  calibration curve was then used as a mean for estimating the temperature, which  was compared to thermocouple measurements. The simulations demonstrated a  substantial improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and suggested that the  implementation of 4-bit sequences is advantageous. The experimental measurements  with bone demonstrated good temperature estimation with an average absolute error  for the water phantoms and brains of 1.46 °C ± 1.22 °C and 1.23 °C ± 0.99 °C,  respectively. In conclusion, a novel noninvasive method utilizing the Golay CoE  for ultrasonic thermal monitoring using a therapeutic FUS transducer is  introduced. This method can lead to the development of an acoustic tool for brain  thermal monitoring.","2022-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","672-680","","2","69","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34851824","","","","*Ultrasonic Therapy/methods; *Ultrasonics; Animals; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Cattle; Feasibility Studies; Phantoms, Imaging; Signal-To-Noise Ratio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although focusing ultrasonic beams on multiple arbitrary regions under the guidance of  magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is needed for precise treatments, current  therapeutic transducers with large pitch sizes have been optimized to focus on  deep brain regions. While annular arrays can adjust the beam foci from cortical  to deep regions, their circular shape may generate eddy current-induced magnetic  flux during MRI. In this study, a quadrisected annular array is proposed to  address these limitations. METHODS: Conventional and quadrisected annular arrays  with three elements were implemented by loading the electrode patterns onto an  850 kHz 1-3 composite PZT disc, with a diameter of 31 mm, including three rings.  MR compatibilities were demonstrated by imaging an MRI phantom with pulse  sequences for B(0) and B(1) mapping and spin-echo imaging. Acoustic beam  profiles, with and without a macaque monkey skull, were measured. A quadrisected  transducer was also used to open the blood-brain barrier(BBB). RESULTS: The flip  angle distortion improved by 20% in spin-echo MR imaging. The acoustic beam  distortions shifting the focal point from 36 to 41mm and elongating the focal  zone from 10 to 15 mm could be recovered to nearly the original values. BBB  openings in the hippocampus and basal region were also demonstrated. CONCLUSION:  The MR compatibility was improved by the increased resistance of the electrodes  in the quadrisected array maintaining dynamic focusing capabilities.

This study evaluates the effects of elastic modulus (E) and impurities on  bubble nuclei available for cavitation in tissue-mimicking polyacrylamide (PA)  hydrogels. A 1.5 MHz focused ultrasound transducer with f# = 0.7 was used to  induce cavitation in 17.5%, 20%, and 22.5% v/v PA hydrogels using 10-ms pulses  with pressures up to peak negative pressure (p-) = 35 MPa. Cavitation was  monitored at 0.075 ms through high-speed photography at 40 000 fps. At  p- = 29 MPa for all hydrogels, cavitation occurred at random locations within the  -6 dB focal area [9.4 × 1.2 mm (p-)]. Increasing p- to 35 MPa increased bubble  location consistency and caused shock scattering in the E = 282 MPa hydrogels; as  the E increased to 300 MPa, bubble location consistency decreased (p = 0.045).  Adding calcium phosphate or cholesterol at 0.25% w/v or bovine serum albumin at  5% or 10% w/v in separate 17.5% PA as impurities decreased the cavitation  threshold from p- = 13.2 MPa for unaltered PA to p- = 11.6 MPa, p- = 7.3 MPa,  p- = 9.7 MPa, and p- = 7.5 MPa, respectively.

Unfortunately, the BBB also hampers the development of pharmaceuticals  targeting receptors, enzymes, or other proteins that lie beyond this barrier.  Especially large molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or  nanoparticles, are prevented to enter the brain. The limited passage of these  molecules partly explains why nanomedicines - targeting brain diseases - have not  made it into the clinic to a great extent. As nanomedicines can target a wide  range of targets including protein isoforms and oligomers or potentially deliver  cytotoxic drugs safely to their targets, a pathway to smuggle nanomedicines into  the brain would allow to treat brain diseases that are currently considered  'undruggable'. In this review, strategies to transport nanomedicines over the BBB  will be discussed. Their challenges and opportunities will be highlighted with  respect to their use for molecular imaging or therapies. Several strategies have  been explored for this thus far. For example, carrier-mediated and  receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT), techniques to disrupt the BBB, nasal drug  delivery or administering nanomedicines directly into the brain have been  explored.

Both show promise, but  the treatment strategy for mental diseases and the technology utilized during  these separate periods will likely differ dramatically. It can be expected that  the initial advancements will be built upon progress of neuroimaging and  stereotactic targeting while surgical technology becomes adapted to  patient-specific symptomatology and structural/functional imaging parameters.  This individualized approach has already begun to show significant promise when  applied to deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression and  obsessive-compulsive disorder. If effectiveness of these strategies is confirmed  by well designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies, further  technological advances will continue into the distant future, and will likely  involve precise neuromodulation at the cellular level, perhaps using wireless  technology with or without closed-loop design. This approach, being theoretically  less invasive and carrying less risk, may ultimately propel psychiatric  neurosurgery to the forefront in the treatment algorithm of mental illness.  Despite prominent development of non-invasive therapeutic options, such as  stereotactic radiosurgery or transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused  ultrasound, chances are there will still be a need in surgical management of  patients with most intractable psychiatric conditions.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","211-228","","1","270","","Prog Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from  preclinical models of neuronal injury and aging support a pivotal role for nerve  growth factor (NGF) in neuroprotection, resilience, and cognitive function.  However, whether NGF can provide therapeutic benefit in the presence of  Alzheimer's disease-related pathologies still unresolved. Perturbations in the  NGF signalling system in Alzheimer's disease may render neurons unable to benefit  from NGF administration. Additionally, challenges related to brain delivery  remain for clinical translation of NGF-based therapies in Alzheimer's disease. To  be safe and efficient, NGF-related agents should stimulate the NGF receptor,  tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), avoid activation through the p75  neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), and be delivered non-invasively to targeted brain  areas using real-time monitoring. We addressed these limitations using MRI-guided  focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS) to increase blood-brain barrier permeability locally  and transiently, allowing an intravenously administered TrkA agonist that does  not activate p75NTR, termed D3, to enter targeted brain areas. Here, we report  the therapeutic potential of selective TrkA activation in a transgenic mouse  model that recapitulates numerous Alzheimer's disease-associated pathologies.  Repeated MRIgFUS-mediated delivery of D3 (D3/FUS) improved cognitive function in  the TgCRND8 model of Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistically, D3/FUS treatment  effectively attenuated cholinergic degeneration and promoted functional recovery.  D3/FUS treatment also resulted in widespread reduction of brain amyloid pathology  and dystrophic neurites surrounding amyloid plaques. Furthermore, D3/FUS markedly  enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis in TgCRND8 mice, implicating TrkA agonism as a  novel therapeutic target to promote neurogenesis in the context of Alzheimer's  disease-related pathology. Thus, this study provides evidence that selective TrkA  agonism confers neuroprotection to effectively counteract Alzheimer's  disease-related vulnerability. Recent clinical trials demonstrate that  non-invasive blood-brain barrier modulation using MRIgFUS is safe, feasible and  reversible in Alzheimer's disease patients. TrkA receptor agonists coupled with  MRIgFUS delivery constitute a promising disease-modifying strategy to foster  brain health and counteract cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.","2022-08-27","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2806-2822","","8","145","","Brain","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2022.

The aim of this study is to  investigate the safety window for FUS levels based on a comprehensive safety  assessment. METHODS: The mice were treated with two different ultrasound  parameters (0.25 MPa and 0.42 MPa) in the thalamus region of brain. The efficacy  of BBB opening was verified by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and the  cavitation monitoring. The transcriptome analysis was performed to investigate  the molecular response for the two BBBD conditions after FUS-mediated BBB opening  in time-dependent manners. Histological analysis was used for evaluation of the  tissue damage, neuronal degeneration, and activation of glial cells induced by  FUS-BBBD. RESULTS: The BBBD, as quantified by the K(trans), was approximately  threefold higher in 0.42 MPa-treated group than 0.25 MPa-treated group. While the  minimal tissue/cellular damage was found in 0.25 MPa-treated group, visible  damages containing microhemorrhages and degenerating neurons were detected in  0.42 MPa-treated group in accordance with the extent of BBBD. In transcriptome  analysis, 0.42 MPa-treated group exhibited highly dynamic changes in the  expression levels of an inflammatory response or NF-κB pathway-relative genes in  a time-dependent manner whereas, 0.25 MPa was not altered. Interestingly,  although it is clear that 0.42 MPa induces neuroinflammation through glial  activation, neuroprotective properties were evident by the expression of A2-type  astrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings propose that a well-defined BBBD parameter  of 0.25 MPa could ensure the safety without cellular/tissue damage or sterile  inflammatory response in the brain. Furthermore, the fact that the excessive  sonication parameters at 0.42 MPa could induce a sterile inflammation response  via glial activation suggested the possibility that could lead to tissue repair  toward the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment through A2-type reactive  astrocytes.","2022-12-23","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","103","","1","19","","Fluids Barriers CNS","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

The delay and sum (DAS) beamformer is the most widely-used strategy in  focused ultrasound imaging (FUI) modality. However, calculating the time delays  and coherently summing the amplitude response in DAS is computationally expensive  and generally require a high-performance processor to realize real-time  processing. In this study, an efficient spectrum beamformer, namely full-matrix  capture (FMC)-stolt, is proposed in FUI system with a linear phased array. The  imaging performance of FMC-stolt was validated with the point-scatter simulation  and in vitro point and cyst phantoms, and then compared with that of five  beamformers, that is, Multiline acquisition (MLA), retrospective transmit  beamforming (RTB) in the FUI modality, as well as DAS, Garcia's  frequency-wavenumber (f-k), Lu's f-k in the coherent plane wave compounding  imaging (CPWCI) modality, under specific conditions. We show that the imaging  performance of FMC-stolt is better than MLA-DAS in non-transmit-focal regions,  and comparable with RTB-DAS at all imaging depths. FMC-stolt also shows better  discontinuity alleviation than MLA and RTB. In addition, FMC-stolt has similar  imaging characteristics (e.g., off-axis resolution, computational cost) as the  f-k beamformers. The computational complexity and actual computational time  indicate that FMC-stolt is comparable to Garcia's f-k, Lu's f-k, and faster than  RTB and CPWCI-DAS if the transmitting numbers are close for FUI and CPWCI. The  study demonstrates that the proposed FMC-stolt could achieve good reconstruction  speed while preserving high-quality images and thus provide a choice for software  beamforming for conventional B-mode ultrasound imaging, especially for hand-held  devices with limited performance processors.","2022-05","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","59-76","","2-3","44","","Ultrason Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35373649","","","","*Algorithms; *Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Computer Simulation; Focused ultrasound imaging; Phantoms, Imaging; Retrospective Studies; Ultrasonography/methods; computational efficiency; full-matrix capture-stolt; spectrum domain beamformer; virtual sources","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Polymer-drug conjugates can be used to deliver drug combinations with a  ratiometric dosing. However, the behaviors and effectiveness of this system have  never been well investigated in GBM models. Here, we report flexible conjugates  of hyaluronic acid (HA) with camptothecin (CPT) and doxorubicin (DOX) delivered  into the brain using focused ultrasound (FUS). In vitro toxicity assays reveal  that DOX-CPT exhibited synergistic action against GBM in a ratio-dependent manner  when delivered as HA conjugates. FUS is employed to improve penetration of  DOX-HA-CPT conjugates into the brain in vivo in a murine GBM model. Small-angle  x-ray scattering characterizations of the conjugates show that the DOX:CPT ratio  affects the polymer chain flexibility. Conjugates with the highest flexibility  yield the highest efficacy in treating mouse GBM in vivo. Our results demonstrate  the association of FUS-enhanced delivery of combination chemotherapy and the  drug-ratio-dependent flexibility of the HA conjugates. Drug ratio in the polymer  nanocomplex may thus be employed as a key factor to modulate FUS drug delivery  efficiency via controlling the polymer flexibility.

Methods & clinical development","","2329-0501","10.1016/j.omtm.2022.09.011","","Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound combined with microbubbles injected in the bloodstream (MRIgFUS) temporarily increases the permeability of  the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which facilitates the entry of intravenously  administered adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) from the blood to targeted brain  areas. To date, the properties of the AAVs used for MRIgFUS delivery resulted in  cell transduction limited to MRIgFUS-targeted sites. Considering future clinical  applications, strategies are needed to deliver genes to multiple locations and  large brain volumes while creating minimal BBB modulation. Here we combine  MRIgFUS with a vector that has enhanced biodistribution following brain entry,  AAV2-HBKO, to mediate broad gene delivery to targeted brain regions at levels  with potential therapeutic relevance. Expression of a reporter gene was achieved  in 13% and 21% of all neurons present in the striatum and thalamus, respectively,  while targeting only 28% of the brain regions with MRIgFUS. Compared with AAV9,  MRIgFUS-mediated delivery of AAV2-HBKO showed greater diffusion in the brain and  a higher percentage of the neurons expressing the transgene. MRIgFUS AAV2-HBKO  gene delivery to the brain has the potential to reach levels that are  functionally and clinically relevant, and this even when using relatively low  intravenous AAV dosages, compared with what is currently used in clinical trials.","2022-12-08","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","167-184","","","27","","Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Author(s).","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36284767  PMCID: PMC9574578","","","","AAV2-HBKO; adeno-associated virus; blood-brain barrier; focused ultrasound; gene delivery; microbubbles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this, we sonicated the right striatum of 16 healthy rats after an  intravenous dose of 5-ALA (200 mg/kg), followed by saline, nanodroplets, or  oxygen-loaded nanodroplets.

The  localized volume of damaged tissue was significantly enhanced by the presence of  oxygen-loaded nanodroplets, compared to ultrasound with unloaded nanodroplets  (3-fold increase), and ultrasound alone (40-fold increase). Sonicating 1 hr  following 5-ALA injection was found to be more potent than 2 hr following 5-ALA  injection (2-fold increase), and the severity of tissue damage corresponded to  the acoustic emissions from droplet vaporization.

Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is considered a  potentially effective strategy for the treatment of addiction. Previous animal  experiments have proven that GDNF has a good therapeutic effect on drug  addiction, but its clinical application is limited due to its poor blood-brain  barrier (BBB) permeability. Low-frequency focused ultrasound, combined with  microbubbles, is a non-invasive and reversible technique for locally-targeted BBB  opening. In the present study, magnetic resonance imaging-guided low-frequency  focused ultrasound, combined with GDNF microbubbles, was used to target BBB  opening in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) region. The effects of GDNF on  morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and acute withdrawal symptoms  in rats after a partially opened BBB were evaluated by behavioral observation.  Western blot was used to detect changes in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression  levels in the VTA region after different treatments, and high performance liquid  chromatography was used to detect the changes in monoamine neurotransmitter  content. The results showed that ultrasound combined with GDNF microbubbles  targeted and opened the BBB in the VTA region, and significantly increased GDNF  content, destroyed morphine-induced CPP, and reduced the withdrawal symptoms of  morphine addiction in rats. Furthermore, the up-regulation of TH expression and  the increase of norepinephrine and dopamine content induced by morphine were  significantly reversed, and the increase of 5-hydroxytryptamine content was  partially reversed. Therefore, ultrasound combined with GDNF microbubbles to  target and open the BBB can effectively increase the content of central GDNF,  thus playing a therapeutic role in morphine addiction. Our study provides a new  approach to locally open the BBB and target delivery of neurotrophic factors,  such as GDNF, to treat brain diseases like addiction.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","961728","","","10","","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Wang, Wu, Hu, Dong, Lin, Li, Wang, Li, Chang, Chang, Liu, Shi and Li.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36046678  PMCID: PMC9420873","","","","blood-brain barrier; drug addiction; focused ultrasound; glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; targeted microbubbles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Safe  and efficient translation to humans requires estimating the acoustic attenuation  of the human skull. Nevertheless, there are no international guidelines for  estimating the impact of the skull bone. A tissue independent, arbitrary derating  was developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to take into account  tissue absorption (0.3 dB/cm-MHz) for diagnostic ultrasound. However, for the  case of transcranial ultrasound imaging, the FDA model does not take into account  the insertion loss induced by the skull bone, nor the absorption by brain tissue.  Therefore, the estimated absorption is overly conservative which could  potentially limit TUS applications if the same guidelines were to be adopted.  Here we propose a three-layer model including bone absorption to calculate the  maximum pressure transmission through the human skull for frequencies ranging  between 100 kHz and 1.5 MHz. The calculated pressure transmission decreases with  the frequency and the thickness of the bone, with peaks for each thickness  corresponding to a multiple of half the wavelength. The 95th percentile maximum  transmission was calculated over the accessible surface of 20 human skulls for 12  typical diameters of the ultrasound beam on the skull surface, and varies between  40% and 78%. To facilitate the safe adjustment of the acoustic pressure for short  ultrasound pulses, such as transcranial imaging or transcranial ultrasound  stimulation, a table summarizes the maximum pressure transmission for each  ultrasound beam diameter and each frequency.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","48-55","","1","16","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

This study aimed to identify the  disease-specific network associated with the therapeutic effects of MRgFUS  thalamotomy on ET and investigate its regional characteristics and genetic  signatures to gain insights into the neurobiological mechanism of ET and MRgFUS  thalamotomy. Twenty-four ET patients treated with MRgFUS thalamotomy underwent  resting-state functional MRI at baseline and postoperative 6 months to measure  the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF). Ordinal trends  canonical variates analysis (OrT/CVA) was performed on the within-subject fALFF  data to identify the ET-related network. Genetic functional enrichment analysis  was conducted to study the genetic signatures of this ET-related network using  brain-wide gene expression data. OrT/CVA analysis revealed a significant  ET-related network for which subject expression showed consistent increases after  surgery. The treatment-induced increases in subject expression were significantly  correlated with concurrent tremor improvement. This network was characterized by  increased activity in the sensorimotor cortex and decreased activity in the  posterior cingulate cortex. It was correlated with an expression map of a  weighted combination genes enriched for mitochondria relevant ontology terms.  This study demonstrates that the therapeutic effects of MRgFUS thalamotomy on ET  are associated with modulating a distinct ET-related network which may be driven  by mitochondria relevant neurobiological mechanism. Quantification of  treatment-induced modulation on the ET-related network can provide an objective  marker for evaluating the efficacy of MRgFUS thalamotomy.","2022-10","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1920-1931","","6","19","","Neurotherapeutics","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

The BBB prevents large molecules from entering the brain  parenchyma. This protective characteristic of the BBB, however, also limits the  delivery of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of brain tumors. To address this  limitation, focused ultrasound (FUS) has been safely utilized to create transient  openings in the BBB, allowing various high molecular weight drugs access to the  brain. We performed a systematic review summarizing current research on treatment  of GBMs using FUS-mediated BBB openings in in vivo mouse and rat models. The  studies gathered here highlight how the treatment paradigm can allow for  increased brain and tumor perfusion of drugs including chemotherapeutics,  immunotherapeutics, gene therapeutics, nanoparticles, and more.

OBJECTIVE: We examine how external liFUS treatment applied to the  L5 DRG affects neuronal changes in single-unit activity from the primary  somatosensory cortex (SI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in a common  peroneal nerve injury (CPNI) rodent model. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were  divided into two cohorts: CPNI liFUS and CPNI sham liFUS. Baseline single-unit  activity (SUA) recordings were taken 20 min prior to treatment and for 4 h post  treatment in 20 min intervals, then analyzed for frequency and compared to  baseline. Recordings from the SI and ACC were separated into pyramidal and  interneurons based on waveform and principal component analysis. RESULTS:  Following CPNI surgery, all rats (n = 30) displayed a significant increase in  mechanical sensitivity. In CPNI liFUS rats, there was a significant increase in  pyramidal neuron spike frequency in the SI region compared to the CPNI sham liFUS  animals beginning at 120 min following liFUS treatment (p < 0.05). In the ACC,  liFUS significantly attenuated interneuron firing beginning at 80 min after liFUS  treatment (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that liFUS changed neuronal  spiking in the SI and ACC regions 80 and 120 min after treatment, respectively,  which may in part correlate with improved sensory thresholds. This may represent  a mechanism of action how liFUS attenuates neuropathic pain. Understanding the  impact of liFUS on pain circuits will help advance the use of liFUS as a  non-invasive neuromodulation option.","2022-10-15","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","136882","","","789","","Neurosci Lett","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

Different biological  effects are induced in tissues and cells by ultrasound actuation depending on  acoustic parameters, such as the wave intensity, frequency and treatment dose.  This non-ionizing radiation has considerable applications in biomedicine  including surgery, medical imaging, physical therapy and cancer therapy.  Depending on the wave intensity, US are applied as high-intensity ultrasounds  (HIUS) and low-intensity pulsed ultrasounds (LIPUS), with different effects on  cells and tissues. HIUS produce thermal and mechanical effects, resulting in a  large localized temperature increase, leading to tissue ablation and even tumor  necrosis. This can be achieved by focusing low intensity waves emitted from  different electrically shifted transducers, known as high-intensity focused  ultrasounds (HIFU). LIPUS have been used extensively as a therapeutic, surgical  and diagnostic tool, with diverse biological effects observed in tissues and  cultured cells. US represent a non-invasive treatment strategy that can be  applied to selected areas of the body, with limited adverse effects. In fact,  tumor ablation using HIFU has been used as a curative treatment in patients with  an early-stage pancreatic tumor and is an effective palliative treatment in  patients with advanced stage disease. However, the biological effects, dose  standardization, benefit-risk ratio and safety are not fully understood. Thus, it  is an emerging field that requires further research in order to reach its full  potential.","2022-02-22","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","531","","1","16","","Oncol Rev","","","","","","","","eng","©Copyright: the Author(s).","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35340884  PMCID: PMC8941342","","","","cancer therapy; cancer treatment; high-intensity ultrasounds (HIUS); low-intensity pulsed ultrasounds (LIPUS); new therapies; ultrasounds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also aimed at determining the miRNA-mRNA relationship and their  pathways in alcohol dependence-induced expression changes after focused  ultrasound therapy. We designed a case-control study for 100 days of observation  to investigate differences in gene expression in the short-term stimulation group  (STS) and long-term stimulation group (LTS) compared with the control sham group  (SG). The study was performed in our Experimental Research Laboratory. 24 male  high alcohol-preferring rats 63 to 79 days old, weighing 270 to 300 g, were  included in the experiment. LTS received 50-day LIFU and STS received 10-day LIFU  and 40-day sham stimulation, while the SG received 50-day sham stimulation. In  miRNA expression analysis, it was found that LIFU caused gene expression  differences in NAc. Significant differences were found between the groups for  gene expression. Compared to the SG, the expression of 454 genes in the NAc  region was changed in the STS while the expression of 382 genes was changed in  the LTS. In the LTS, the expression of 32 genes was changed in total compared to  STS. Our data suggest that LIFU targeted on NAc may assist in the treatment of  alcohol dependence, especially in the long term possibly through altering gene  expression. Our immunohistochemical studies verified that LIFU does not cause any  tissue damage. These findings may lead to new studies in investigating the  efficacy of LIFU for the treatment of alcohol dependence and also for other  psychiatric disorders.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1099-1116","","2","60","","Mol Neurobiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Patients are often cautioned against intervention, which can lead to  psychosocial problems and low self-esteem. Improved treatment modalities are  therefore relevant from both medical and aesthetic perspectives. METHODS: Two  volunteer subjects were treated with a medical 20 MHz high intensity focused  ultrasound device developed for dermatological conditions. One patient was given  three treatments to remove a superficial congenital hemangioma on the left middle  cheek. The other patient was given a single treatment to remove seven cherry  angiomas on the thighs. Handpieces with nominal focal depths of 0.8 - 1.8 mm  below the skin surface were used to administer acoustic energy of 1.1 -  1.2 J/dose. An integrated dermoscope in the handpiece was used to monitor the  treatment in real-time. RESULTS: During treatment, blood in the capillary network  of the lesions was coagulated immediately, and capillary walls were collapsed due  to the thermal and mechanical effects of the high intensity focused ultrasound.  During the healing phase, the areas regenerated a normal skin structure with very  limited scar or dyspigmentation. At follow-up, a clear aesthetic improvement was  observed over the baseline for all treated targets with the exception of two  cherry angiomas, where focal depth and/or dose coverage had not been optimal.  CONCLUSION: High intensity focused ultrasound is concluded to be a safe and  efficient skin treatment for benign superficial vascular malformations and  tumors.","2022-08","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","3371-3379","","8","21","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.

When delivered under  magnetic resonance (MR) imaging guidance, the change in tissue relaxivity on  heating is used to monitor the temperatures achieved. Different tissue types in  the pre-focal beam path result in energy loss defined by their individual  attenuation coefficients. Furthermore, at interfaces with different acoustic  impedances the beam will be both reflected and refracted, changing the position  of the focus. For complex interfaces this effect is exacerbated. Moreover, blood  vessels proximal to the focal region can dissipate heat, altering the expected  region of damage. In the target volume, the temperature distribution depends on  the thermal conductivity (or diffusivity) of the tissue and its heat capacity.  These are different for vascular tissues, water and fat containing tissues and  bone. Therefore, documenting the characteristics of the pre-focal and target  tissues is critical for effective delivery of HIFU. MR imaging provides excellent  anatomic detail and characterization of soft tissue components. It is an ideal  modality for real-time planning and monitoring of HIFU ablation, and provides  non-invasive temperature maps. Clinical applications involve soft-tissue  (abdomino-pelvic applications) or bone (brain applications) pre-focally and at  the target (soft-tissue tumors and bone metastases respectively). This article  addresses the technical difficulties of delivering HIFU effectively when vascular  tissues, densely cellular tissues, fat or bone are traversed pre-focally, and the  clinical applications that target these tissues. The strengths and limitations of  MR techniques used for monitoring ablation in these tissues are also discussed.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1037959","","","12","","Front Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 deSouza, Gedroyc, Rivens and ter Haar.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36387108  PMCID: PMC9663991","","","","bone; fat; high intensity focussed ultrasound; magnetic resonance imaging; soft tissue; vascular","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this study is to research the feasibility of the entropy parameter of  RF time series of ultrasound backscattered signals for measuring the changes in  temperature induced by a LIFU device. Entropy Imaging is a technique for  reconstructing ultrasound images based on the average uncertainty of time-series  in a signal. Furthermore, the Shannon Entropy can quantify the uncertainty of a  random process and is usually used as a measure for the information content of  probability distributions. In this study, we use the Entropy Imaging method for  measuring the LIFU-induced temperature changes in the deep region of ex vivo  porcine tissue samples. The results obtained show that the changes of entropy  parameter of RF time series signal are proportional to temperature changes  recorded by a calibrated thermocouple in the temperature range of 37-47°C. In  conclusion, in this study we show that Shannon entropy of RF time series signal  possesses promising features like succinctly capturing the available information  in a system by considering the uncertainty in a given data that can be used, as a  new method, to measure temperature changes non-invasively and quantitatively in  the deep region of tissue.","2022-10","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1502-1512","","10","236","","Proc Inst Mech Eng H","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36112938","","","","*Antineoplastic Agents; *Thermometry; Animals; Drug Liberation; Noninvasive ultrasound thermometry; Shannon entropy; Swine; Time Factors; Ultrasonography; entropy imaging; focused ultrasound (FUS); low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU); temperature estimation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main therapies include surgery and oral  contraceptive administration. Percutaneous cryoablation and high intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU) are also proven to be valid alternatives. Microwave  ablation (MWA) as one of the thermal ablation methods has not been applied in the  treatment of AWE yet. Herein the feasibility of ultrasound (US) -guided MWA for  AWE was explored and treatment response evaluation was carried out using  contrast-enhanced imaging. METHODS: Three consecutive patients who underwent  US-guided MWA for AWE with typical symptoms were included in this retrospective  study. US, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), laboratory tests, and US-guided  core-needle biopsy were conducted for pre-treatment assessment and ruling out  malignancy. The interventional procedure was carried out under local anesthesia  with MWA and the output power was 60w. Post-treatment contrast-enhanced  ultrasound (CEUS) was performed to evaluate the instant treatment response. The  follow-up intervals were 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after treatment. The  clinical symptoms and condition of AWE lesions were recorded in each follow-up.  RESULTS: The MWA procedure was completed in all the patients with no blood  perfusion inside each lesion by instant CEUS after treatment. The mean ablation  time was 687 seconds (s) for a single patient (ranged from 660s to 742s).  Clinical symptoms were relieved evidently at the end of the follow-up. The pain  according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) decreased from 4-6 before treatment  to 0-2 after treatment. Mild to moderate complications included slightly  abdominal pain and fat liquefaction occurred. In terms of technical outcomes, the  volume of all six lesions reduced in different degrees at the end of follow-up  (ranged: 16.6% to 100%).

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been widely used in the therapy of  uterine leiomyomas. However, HIFU method has a prolonged duration of operation  and poor patient tolerance, which need improvement. This study sought to explore  the efficacy and safety of add-on use of oxytocin in uterine leiomyomas patients  who received HIFU and ultrasound-guided percutaneous anhydrous ethanol injection.  METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial. A total of 60 patients with  uterine leiomyomas were included and randomly divided into study group and  control group. The patients in the control group were treated with HIFU and  ultrasound-guided percutaneous anhydrous ethanol injection, while the study group  received oxytocin injection in addition to the treatment measures of the control  group. The efficacy and safety of the treatments were assessed by using the  volume ablation rate of the tumor and the Society of Interventional Radiology  (SIR) Practice Guidelines, respectively. RESULTS: Finally, all of the 60 patients  (30 in the study group and 30 in the control group) completed the treatments.  There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms  of leiomyoma volume ablation rate (94.48%±2.07% vs. 94.91%±2.53%, P=0.36), crumb  gray time (150.70±57.51 vs. 165.77±77.13 s, P=0.37), total treatment energy  (556,835.0±202,583 vs. 512,610.0±158,004 J, P=0.19), and total treatment time  (116.70±28.61 vs. 107.40±23.22 mins, P=0.14). The pain score of the oxytocin  group was significantly greater than that in the control group (4.53±1.55 vs.  3.60±1.19, P=0.008). At 3 months and 1-year post-therapy, no statistically  significant differences were observed in the residual necrotic leiomyoma volume  between the 2 groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We  retrospectively analyzed 40 PAS patients between April 2017 and October 2021. All  the patients received one session of HIFU treatment. Regular follow-up was done  after HIFU treatment until normal menstruation returned and placental tissue  disappeared. The patient's reproductive-related outcomes were obtained through  telephone interviews. RESULTS: The median follow-up time for the 40 patients was  30.50 (15.75-44.00) months and the mean placental tissue elimination time was  45.29 ± 33.32 days. The mean duration of bloody lochia was 13.43 ± 10.01 days,  with no incidences of severe bleeding. Notably, Linear regression analysis showed  that the residual placenta volume before HIFU was a factor affecting the duration  of bloody lochia after HIFU (R2 = 0.284, B = 0.062, P = 0.000). The normal  menstrual return time was 58.71 ± 31.14 days. One (2.50%) patient developed an  infection. Two (5.00%) patients were subjected to ultrasound-guided suction  curettage for persistent vaginal discharge for more than one month without  infection. Notably, 7 of the 18 patients who expressed reproductive plans became  pregnant during the 4 to 53 months of follow-up without placental abnormalities.  The remaining 11 patients were on contraceptives. CONCLUSIONS: Single HIFU is an  effective treatment option for managing PAS.

This study aims to verify that  ultrasound-guided histotripsy using millisecond-length two-stage ultrasound  pulses combined with fundamental and second harmonic superposition can enhance  treatment in rabbit kidneysin vivo. Approach.Rabbit kidneys (n = 10) were treated  using a custom-designed 1.1/2.2 MHz two-element confocal-annular array, with  lateral and axial full width at half-maximum pressure dimensions of approximately  1.0 and 6.0 mm. Two-stage ultrasound pulses were applied: stage 1 used 60-80  pulses with a pulse duration of 6 ms and a pulse repetition frequency of 10 Hz.  Meanwhile, stage 2 consists of 2-4 periods, each period consists of a  concentrated pulse train of localized high DC of 6% and an off-time of 3-5 s,  with an average DC of 1%-1.5%. B-mode ultrasound imaging was used to guide and  monitor the boiling and cavitation bubbles.Main results.Ultrasound-guided  treatment was successful in all rabbits, and the ablation rate is about seven  times that of single-frequency combined two-stage pulses, achieving enhanced  histotripsy. The regular elliptical lesions with dimensions of 10.6 ± 0.8  mm × 3.9 ± 0.6 mm (axial × lateral) were generated, and a large-volume lesion was  generated by multi-point treatment. The size of most lysates was about 2.5μm.  Histologically, lesions were completely homogenized and well demarcated between  treated-untreated areas. There was no apparent damage to critical structures  surrounding lesions. Nonlinear simulations revealed that it may be the  interaction between shock front and the cavitation and boiling bubbles generated  by the dual-frequency effect enhanced the treatment efficiency.Significance.The  novel histotripsy could improve treatment efficiency and generate regular  elliptical lesions with controllable shape and axial dimensions, which may be a  useful tool in treating renal cell carcinoma.","2022-11-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","21","67","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36174543","","","","*Carcinoma, Renal Cell; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; *Kidney Neoplasms; *Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy; Animals; Kidney; Rabbits; Ultrasonography; boiling; fundamental and second harmonic superposition; millisecond-length two-stage ultrasound pulses; ultrasound-guided and monitored histotripsy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tumor cells can escape from immune surveillance and killing; therefore,  various strategies are continuously developing to inhibit immune escape. Focused  ultrasound (FUS) has recently emerged to play an important role in immune  modulation. After FUS therapy, various tumor antigens and related signals are  released. The non-thermal effect of FUS strengthens the blood and lymph  circulation, increases cell permeability, and helps in crossing the physical  barrier like the blood-brain barrier and blood-tumor barrier. However, the  different ablation of FUS is proposed to have a different anti-tumor immune  effect.

MATERIALS  AND METHODS: 339 women with 368 hyperintense uterine fibroids on T2WI who  underwent single-session HIFU ablation were enrolled, including 283 patients with  303 fibroids in the single-session HIFU (sHIFU) group and 56 patients with 65  fibroids in the HIFU pretreated with GnRH-a (Gn-HIFU) group. The signal intensity  (SI) value and standard deviation (SD) value were measured based on T2WI, and the  fibroids were further subdivided into heterogeneous hyperintense fibroids,  slightly homogeneous hyperintense fibroids and markedly homogeneous hyperintense  fibroids as 3 subgroups (HHF, sHHF and mHHF group respectively). Treatment time,  sonication time, dose, non-perfused volume (NPV), NPV per sonication time,  non-perfused volume ratio (NPVR), energy effect ratio (EEF) and adverse events  were recorded. RESULTS: Out of 339 patients, the median NPVR was 75.2%  (interquartile range,31.5%). After propensity score matching, the matched cohort  included 91 (64.5%) patients in the sHIFU group and 48 (34.5%) patients in the  Gn-HIFU group. The NPVR of sHHF in the Gn-HIFU group had significantly smaller  than that in the sHIFU group (60.2% versus 74.9%, p = 0.005), and the NPVR of HHF  in the Gn-HIFU group was higher than those in the sHIFU group (87.4% versus  72.9%, p = 0.002).

Due to the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus  (HBV) infection in China, the incidence of HCC in China is high, and liver  cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis also brings great challenges to treatment.  This paper reviewed the latest research progress on minimally invasive treatments  for HCC, including percutaneous thermal ablation and new nonthermal ablation  techniques, and introduced the principles, advantages, and clinical applications  of various therapeutic methods in detail. DATA SOURCES: The data of treatments  for HCC were systematically collected from the PubMed, ScienceDirect, American  Chemical Society and Web of Science databases published in English, using  ""minimally invasive"" and ""hepatocellular carcinoma"" or ""liver cancer"" as the  keywords. RESULTS: Percutaneous thermal ablation is still a first-line strategy  for the minimally invasive treatment of HCC. The effect of microwave ablation  (MWA) on downgrading treatment before liver transplantation is better than that  of radiofrequency ablation (RFA), while RFA is more widely used in the clinical  practice. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is mainly used for the  palliative treatment of advanced liver cancer. Electrochemotherapy (ECT) delivers  chemotherapeutic drugs to the target cells while reducing the blood supply around  HCC. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) uses a microsecond-pulsed electric field  that induces apoptosis and necrosis and triggers a systemic immune response. The  nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF) has achieved a good response in the  ablation of mice with HCC, but it has not been reported in China for the  treatment of human HCC. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of minimally invasive treatments  provide a sufficient survival advantage for HCC patients. Nonthermal ablation  will lead to a new wave with its unique advantage of antitumor recurrence and  metastasis.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","54-63","","1","22","","Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine in China.

Method: 53 benign breast tumors of 28 patients treated by  ultrasound-guided focused ultrasound surgery (USgFUS) were included in this  study. The sonication energy per unit volume of each tumor was calculated.  Three-quarter point was chosen as the cut-off to divide the 53 included tumors  into high sonication energy (HSE, n = 14) and low sonication energy (LSE, n = 39)  groups. For each tumor, the region of interest (ROI) of both the tumor itself  (tROI) and the near field tissue (nfROI) were delineated and analyzed separately  using ImageJ software. Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple linear  regression analysis were used for radiomics feature selection. To explore the  diagnostic performance of different ultrasound radiomics features, a receiver  operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. Results: In total of  68 radiomics features were extracted from pre-ablation ultrasound images of each  tumor. Of all radiomics features, BX in tROI (p < 0.001), BX (p = 0.001) and Circ  (p = 0.019) in nfROI were independently predictive features of sonication energy  per unit volume. The ROC curves showed that the area under the curve (AUC) values  of BX in tROI, BX, and Circ in nfROI were 0.797, 0.787 and 0.822, respectively.

Symptoms can include discomfort, and they can become problematic, particularly  when they enlarge, resulting in many referrals for biopsies, with fibroadenomas  accounting for 30-75% of the cases. Diagnosis is based on triple assessment that  involves a clinical examination, ultrasound imaging, and mammography, as well as  core needle biopsies. Current management includes observation for 6-12 months,  with the indication of definitive surgery, in cases that are older than 35 years  or with fibroadenoma persistence. Serious adverse effects of surgery might  include nipple areolar distortion, scarring, and damage to the breast tissue, as  well as the risks associated with surgery and anesthesia, making it a  non-feasible option. METHODS: A literature search was performed on the databases  Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, and Ovid for English language papers  published between January 1, 2000, and March 17, 2021. A structured protocol was  employed to devise a comprehensive search strategy with keywords and Boolean  operators defined by the research question. The keywords used for the search were  ""HIFU"", ""High Intensity Focused Ultrasound,"" ""Fibroadenoma,"" ""Breast,"" ""Lesion.""  This review was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Recently, a  thermal ablative technique, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), was found  to be a safe, noninvasive, and technically successful alternative, having  displayed promising outcomes in reducing the volume of fibroadenomas, pain  experienced by patients, and the length of hospitalization. Quality of life  improvement was also evidenced, exhibited by the disappearance of symptoms, and  enhanced physical activity post-intervention, in addition to patients'  satisfaction with the cosmetic results and future recommendation of the procedure  to other patients. CONCLUSION: Overall, HIFU is a well-tolerated treatment  associated, with low risk of complications, that can potentially include  erythema, skin discoloration, and bruising with the majority of these  self-resolving shortly after the procedure.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","279-288","","4","18","","Breast Care (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 S.

Because enzyme concentrations and their (sub)cellular  compartmentalization are highly heterogeneous in different tumor types and  patients, we propose ultrasound-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy (UDEPT) as a  means to increase enzyme access and availability for prodrug activation locally.  Methods: We synthesized β-glucuronidase-sensitive self-immolative doxorubicin  prodrugs with different spacer lengths between the active drug moiety and the  capping group. We evaluated drug conversion, uptake and cytotoxicity in the  presence and absence of the activating enzyme β-glucuronidase. To trigger the  cell release of β-glucuronidase, we used high-intensity focused ultrasound to aid  in the conversion of the prodrugs into their active counterparts. Results: More  efficient enzymatic activation was observed for self-immolative prodrugs with  more than one aromatic unit in the spacer. In the absence of β-glucuronidase, the  prodrugs showed significantly reduced cellular uptake and cytotoxicity compared  to the parent drug. High-intensity focused ultrasound-induced mechanical  destruction of cancer cells resulted in release of intact β-glucuronidase, which  activated the prodrugs, restored their cytotoxicity and induced immunogenic cell  death. Conclusion: These findings shed new light on prodrug design and  activation, and they contribute to novel UDEPT-based mechanochemical combination  therapies for the treatment of cancer.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","4791-4801","","10","12","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","eng","© The author(s).","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 35832083  PMCID: PMC9254251","","","","*Neoplasms/drug therapy; *Prodrugs/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Cancer; Doxorubicin/therapeutic use; Focused ultrasound; Glucuronidase/metabolism; HIFU; Humans; Prodrugs; β-glucuronidase","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Only 20% of patients are eligible to receive surgery at diagnosis.  Hence, new therapies are needed to improve outcomes for non-surgical candidates.  Thermal ablation techniques can offer a non-invasive alternative to surgery. AIM:  The aim of this review is to map the literature for the use of thermal ablative  techniques: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), High-intensity focused ultrasound  (HIFU), Microwave ablation (MWA), and Laser ablation (LA) in the management of  patients with PC. METHODS: A search strategy was applied to PUBMED and EMBASE  using keywords concerning pancreatic cancer, radiofrequency ablation, ultrasound  ablation, laser ablation, and microwave ablation. The studies that fit this  inclusion criteria were summarized in table format and results reviewed for  interpretation. RESULTS: 72 clinical studies were included. Most of the included  studies related to RFA (n=35) and HIFU (n=27). The most common study design was  retrospective (n=33). Only 3 randomized control trials (RCT) were included, all  of which related to RFA. Safety outcomes were reported in 53 of the 72 studies,  and survival outcomes were reported in 39. Statistically significant survival  benefits were demonstrated in 11 studies. CONCLUSION: The evidence for the  benefit of MWA and LA in PC patients is limited. RFA and HIFU are safe and  feasible therapies to be used in PC patients.

The efficacy of these methods can be  further improved by combining them with various nano-systems, thus enabling: (i)  a better resolution of ultrasound imaging, allowing for example the visualization  of angiogenic blood vessels, (ii) the specific tumor targeting of anti-tumor  chemotherapeutic drugs or gases attached to or encapsulated in nano-systems and  released in a controlled manner in the tumor under ultrasound application, (iii)  tumor treatment at tumor site using more moderate heating temperatures than with  HIFU. Furthermore, some nano-systems display adjustable sizes, i.e. nanobubbles  can grow into micro-bubbles. Such dual size is advantageous since it enables  gathering within the same unit the targeting properties of nano bubbles via EPR  effect and the enhanced ultrasound contrasting properties of micro bubbles.  Interestingly, the way in which nano-systems act against a tumor could in  principle also be adjusted by accurately selecting the nano-system among a large  choice and by tuning the values of the ultrasound parameters, which can lead, due  to their mechanical nature, to specific effects such as cavitation that are  usually not observed with purely electromagnetic waves and can potentially help  destroying the tumor. This review highlights the clinical potential of these  combined treatments that can improve the benefit/risk ratio of current cancer  treatments.","2022-03-18","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","139","","1","20","","J Nanobiotechnology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Medically intractable epilepsy has a  real impact on a patient's quality of life, neurologic morbidity and even  mortality. Actual therapy options are an increase in drug dosage, radiosurgery,  resective surgery and non-resective neuromodulatory treatments (deep brain  stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation). Resective, thermoablative or  neuromodulatory surgery in the treatment of epilepsy are invasive procedures,  sometimes requiring long stay-in for the patients, risks of permanent  neurological deficit, general anesthesia and other potential surgery-related  complications such as a hemorrhage or an infection. Radiosurgical approaches can  trigger radiation necrosis, brain oedema and transient worsening of epilepsy.  With technology-driven developments and pursuit of minimally invasive  neurosurgery, transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound has become a valuable  treatment for neurological diseases. In this critical review, we aim to give the  reader a better understanding of current advancement for ultrasound in the  treatment of epilepsy. By outlining the current understanding gained from both  preclinical and clinical studies, this article explores the different mechanisms  and potential applications (thermoablation, blood brain barrier disruption for  drug delivery, neuromodulation and cortical stimulation) of high and low  intensity ultrasound and compares the various possibilities available to patients  with intractable epilepsy. Technical limitations of therapeutic ultrasound for  epilepsy surgery are also detailed and discussed.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1055-1065","","10","178","","Rev Neurol (Paris)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this review, the authors examine low-intensity  focused ultrasound for brain mapping and neuromodulation. They also discuss  high-intensity focused ultrasound, which is used for incisionless surgeries, such  as capsulotomies for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Future potential applications  of focused ultrasound are also presented.","2022-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","32-35","","1","20","","Focus (Am Psychiatr Publ)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 by the American Psychiatric Association.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35746933  PMCID: PMC9063590","","","","Ablation; Neuromodulation; Neurosurgery; Research/psychiatric","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles (MBs) can  locally and transiently open the BBB, providing a potential strategy for drug  delivery across the BBB into the brain. Nowadays, taking advantage of this  technology, many therapeutic agents, such as antibodies, growth factors, and  nanomedicine formulations, are intensively investigated across the BBB into  specific brain regions for the treatment of various brain diseases. Several  preliminary clinical trials also have demonstrated its safety and good tolerance  in patients. This review gives an overview of the basic mechanisms, ultrasound  contrast agents, evaluation or monitoring methods, and medical applications of  FUS-mediated BBB opening in glioblastoma, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's  disease.","2022-11","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","114539","","","190","","Adv Drug Deliv Rev","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.
