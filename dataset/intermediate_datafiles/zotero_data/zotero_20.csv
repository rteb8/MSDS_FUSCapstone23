Randomized controlled human trials and  controlled animal studies were included. The neuromodulation effects of LITUS on  clinical or pre-clinical, neurophysiological, neuroimaging, histological and  biochemical outcomes, and adverse events were summarized. In total, 11 human  studies and 44 animal studies were identified. LITUS demonstrated therapeutic  efficacy in neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, pain, sleep disorders  and hypertension. LITUS-related changes in neuronal structure and cortical  activity were found. From histological and biochemical perspectives, prominent  findings included suppressing the inflammatory response and facilitating  neurogenesis. No adverse effects were reported in controlled animal studies  included in our review, while reversible headache, nausea, and vomiting were  reported in a few human subjects. Overall, LITUS alleviates various symptoms and  modulates associated brain circuits without major side effects. Future research  needs to establish a solid therapeutic framework for LITUS.","2024-01","2024-03-06 17:09:51","2024-03-06T17:09:51Z","","105501","","","156","","Neurosci Biobehav Rev","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

In PD patients, aberrant methylation of SNCA (α-synuclein gene) has been reported  and may be a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we established an  epigenetic regulation platform based on an exosomal CRISPR intervention system.  With the assist of focused ultrasound (FUS) opening the blood-brain barrier,  engineered exosomes carrying RVG (rabies viral glycoprotein) targeting peptide,  sgRNA (single guide RNA), and dCas9-DNMT3A (named RVG-CRISPRi-Exo) were  efficiently delivered into the brain lesions and induced specific methylation of  SNCA. In vivo, FUS combined with RVG-CRISPRi-Exo significantly improved motor  performance, balance coordination, and neurosensitivity in PD mice, greatly  down-regulated the elevation of α-synuclein (α-syn) caused by modeling, rescued  cell apoptosis, and alleviated the progression of PD in mice. [(18)F]-FP-DTBZ  imaging suggested that the synaptic function of the nigrostriatal pathway could  be restored, which was conducive to the control of motor behavior in PD mice.  Pyrosequencing results showed that RVG-CRISPRi-Exo could methylate CpG at  specific sites of SNCA, and this fine-tuned editing achieved good therapeutic  effects in PD model mice. In vitro, RVG-CRISPRi-Exo down-regulated SNCA  transcripts and α-syn expression and relieved neuronal cell damage. Collectively,  our findings provide a proof-of-principle for the development of targeted brain  nanodelivery based on engineered exosomes and provide insights into epigenetic  regulation of brain diseases.","2024-03-04","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38437635","","","","Epigenetic regulation; Exosome; Parkinson’s disease; SNCA; Ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The mice treated with TMAS once daily for  21 days. We recorded local field potential signals in the hippocampal CA1 region  of the mice after TMAS treatment with in-vivo electrophysiology and evaluated the  neural rehabilitative effect of TMAS with sharp-wave ripple (SWR), gamma  oscillations during SWRs, and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). The spatial memory  function of the mice was examined by the Morris water maze (MWM) task. RESULTS:  We found that TMAS improved the performance of MWM related spatial cognitive  functions compared with AD group. Furthermore, our results implied that TMAS  alleviated abnormalities in hippocampal SWRs, increased slow gamma power during  SWRs, and promoted theta-slow gamma phase-amplitude coupling. These findings  suggest that TMAS could have a positive influence on spatial memory through the  modulation of neural oscillations. DISCUSSION: This work emphasizes the potential  of TMAS to serve as a non-invasive method for Alzheimer's disease rehabilitation  and promote the application of TMAS for the treatment of more neurological and  brain aging diseases in the future.","2024","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","1313639","","","18","","Front Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 Zhang, Guo, Xu, Mi, Liu, Li, Xie and Xu.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38384480  PMCID: PMC10879395","","","","Alzheimer's disease; local field potentials; neural oscillations; neuromodulation; transcranial magneto-acoustic stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The location and extent of the lesion within anterior limb of the  internal capsule (ALIC) remains uncertain. Accumulating evidence has suggested  that the lesion should be located ventrally while limiting the dorsal extent. Our  center is now targeting specific fiber tracts within the lower half of the ALIC.  METHOD: Presurgical diffusion tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was used to  identify individual fibre tracts within the ventral aspect of the ALIC in the  last two patients who underwent BAC at our center. One patient had TRD and the  other had both TROCD and TRD. Radiofrequency-induced thermal lesions were created  in the identified targets with lesion volumes between 20 and 229 mm(3) (average  95 mm(3)). FINDINGS: Both patients were responders with neither experiencing  significant side effects including compromised executive functions. LIMITATIONS:  The generalizability of our findings is limited because the outcome is based on  two subjects. CONCLUSION: This work suggests that BAC can be individually  tailored and more limited to the ventral aspect of the ALIC and is effective and  safe for TRD and TROCD. Accumulating data also suggests that to be clinically  effective the length of the capsulotomy should be about 10mm. BAC's use may  increase with the growing utilization and mastery of magnetic resonance guided  focused ultrasound.","2024-04-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","887-894","","","350","","J Affect Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

DESIGN: A retrospective analysis. SETTING: The gynaecology  departments of class A and class B secondary and tertiary hospitals in Hubei  Province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 101 008 patients diagnosed with UFs from 1 January  2018 to 31 December 2021. RESULTS: The hospitalised patients with UFs increased  with age, reaching a peak at ages 45-49 years and then gradually decreasing.  Among these patients, 19.05% had anaemia symptoms. Women aged 25-29 years were  more likely to be treated with laparoscopic myomectomy (62.22%), while women aged  20-24 years tend to choose open myomectomy (34.58%). Women over age 45 years who  had entered perimenopause tended to be treated with laparoscopic hysterectomy  (64.85% for those aged 65-69 years). Patients with fibroid with  moderate-to-severe anaemia mostly chose hysterectomy. As a whole, the proportion  of patients who chose laparoscopic hysterectomy was similar to that of patients  who chose laparoscopic myomectomy (31.38% vs 31.14%). Only 2.08% of UFs were  treated with high-frequency MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS). The  number of patients who choose laparoscopic surgery or MRgFUS treatment was  increasing year by year. After stratifying by hospital grade, we found that women  treated at class A tertiary hospitals were more likely to have laparoscopic than  open surgery (66.12% vs 31.26%). At class B secondary hospitals, 61.9% of the  patients underwent myomectomy. By contrast, hysterectomy was used to treat the  majority of patients at class A secondary hospitals and class B tertiary  hospitals (57.79% and 57.57%, respectively). Use of MRgFUS was mainly  concentrated within class A tertiary hospitals. CONCLUSION: UFs affect mainly  women in childbearing period. Most patients chose to receive treatment at class A  tertiary hospitals, among which laparoscopic myomectomy was the mainstream  surgical method for patients in Hubei Province.

BACKGROUND: Recurrence of localized  prostate cancer after primary radiotherapy (RT) remains a clinical challenge.  There is no consensus on optimal nonsurgical local salvage therapies, which  mainly consist of cryotherapy (CRYO), high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU),  high/low-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR/LDR), and stereotactic body radiotherapy  (SBRT). METHODS: Our study was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items  for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We systematically  searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov up to  September 2023 to identify potentially relevant studies. The risk of bias was  assessed using the European Association of Urology (EAU) items. Biochemical  recurrence-free survival (bRFS) and genitourinary/gastrointestinal toxicities  were the outcomes of interest. Pooled rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)  were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 99 studies comprising 8440 patients were  included. The pooled rate of 1-year biochemical control (BC) was highest for LDR  (0.88, 95%CI 0.72-0.95) and lowest for SBRT (0.68, 95%CI 0.49-0.83). The pooled  rate of 5-year BC was highest for CRYO (0.52, 95%CI 0.33-0.69) and lowest for HDR  (0.23, 95%CI 0.08-0.51). HIFU presented the worst outcome of grade ≥3  genitourinary toxicities (GU3), with a rate of 0.22 (95%CI 0.12-0.3). Conversely,  CRYO (0.09, 95%CI 0.04-0.14), HDR (0.05, 95%CI 0.02-0.07), LDR (0.10, 95%CI  0.06-0.14) and SBRT (0.06, 95%CI 0.03-0.09) presented low rates of GU3. All  subgroups induced a quite low incidence of grade ≥3 gastrointestinal toxicities  (GI3). CONCLUSIONS: Nonsurgical salvage therapies are promising modalities for  prostate cancer in the local radiorecurrence setting. Based on the preliminary  evidence from this study, CRYO and SBRT might present a relatively steady  efficacy of BC with acceptable treatment-related toxicities.","2024-02-09","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","Int J Surg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

In the present study, we  evaluated the efficacy and immunomodulation of SDT with fluorescein as the  sonosensitizer in immunocompetent GL261 glioma mice for the first time. In vitro  studies demonstrated that the exposure of GL261 cells to FL-SDT induced  immunogenic cell death and relevant upregulation of MHC class I, CD80 and CD86  expression. In vivo studies were then performed to treat GL261 glioma-bearing  mice with FL-SDT, fluorescein alone, or FUS alone. Perturbation of the  glioma-associated macrophage subset within the immune microenvironment was  induced by all the treatments. Notably, a relevant depletion of myeloid-derived  suppressor cells (MDSCs) and concomitant robust infiltration of CD8+ T cells were  observed in the SDT-FL-treated mice, resulting in a significant radiological  delay in glioma progression and a consequent improvement in survival. Tumor  control and improved survival were also observed in mice treated with FL alone  (median survival 41.5 days, p > 0.0001 compared to untreated mice), reflecting  considerable modulation of the immune microenvironment. Interestingly, a high  circulating lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio and a very low proportion of MDSCs were  predictive of better survival in FL- and FL-SDT-treated mice than in untreated  and FUS-treated mice, in which elevated monocyte and MDSC frequencies correlated  with worse survival. The immunostimulatory potential of FL-SDT treatment and the  profound modulation of most immunosuppressive components within the  microenvironment encouraged the exploration of the combination of FL-SDT with  immunotherapeutic strategies.","2024-02-15","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","4","16","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38398183  PMCID: PMC10886594","","","","CD8 infiltrating T cells; MDSC; fluorescein; glioma; immune microenvironment; mouse model; sonodynamic therapy; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The spatiotemporal response of phase-shift droplets to focused  ultrasound above a certain pressure threshold, termed acoustic droplet  vaporization (ADV), is influenced by intrinsic features (e.g., bulk boiling  point) and extrinsic factors (e.g., driving frequency and surrounding media). A  deep understanding of ADV dynamics is critical to ensure the robustness and  repeatability of an ADV-assisted application. Here, we integrated  ultra-high-speed imaging, at 10 million frames per second, and confocal  microscopy for a full-scale (i.e., from nanoseconds to seconds) characterization  of ADV. Experiments were conducted in fibrin-based hydrogels to mimic soft tissue  environments. Effects of fibrin concentration (0.2 to 8 % (w/v)), excitation  frequency (1, 2.5, and 9.4 MHz), and perfluorocarbon core (perfluoropentane,  perfluorohexane, and perfluorooctane) on ADV dynamics were studied. Several  fundamental parameters related to ADV dynamics, such as expansion ratio,  expansion velocity, collapse radius, collapse time, radius of secondary rebound,  resting radius, and equilibrium radius of the generated bubbles were extracted  from the radius vs time curves. Diffusion-driven ADV-bubble growth was fit to a  modified Epstein-Plesset equation, adding a material stress term, to estimate the  growth rate. Our results indicated that ADV dynamics were significantly impacted  by fibrin concentration, frequency, and perfluorocarbon liquid core. This is the  first study to combine ultra-high-speed and confocal microscopy techniques to  provide insights into ADV bubble dynamics in tissue-mimicking hydrogels.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","106754","","","103","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

The sea turtle, Lepidochelys olivacea, is a long-lived organism, with  migratory habits and feeding behaviors that allow exposure to various pollutants.  This work aimed to determine long-term exposure to POPs in adult olive ridley  turtles (L. olivacea), sampled during the nesting season, in ""La Escobilla""  Sanctuary. Blood samples were collected and processed to obtain plasma. The  quantification of POPs in blood was carried out with an extraction technique with  a focused ultrasound probe. Twenty-seven POP analytes were determined. The  concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexane, endosulfan isomers,  dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, total polychlorinated biphenyls, and the total  sum of POPs found in plasma are higher than those reported in other studies,  which reported effects such as hematological and biochemical changes in blood,  changes in immune system cells and enzymatic activity related to oxidative  stress. These results are important to demonstrate the chronic exposure to POPs  in olive ridley turtles in marine ecosystems and to highlight the importance of  assessing the associated health risks, considering that these contaminants could  be transferred to the offspring and affect future generations of this reptile. It  is important to carry out studies that develop conservation strategies for the  olive ridley turtle.

When it comes  to imaging in the human abdomen, convex arrays are preferred due to their large  acoustic window. However, existing PAM methods for convex arrays rely on the  computationally expensive delay-and-sum (DAS) operation limiting the image  reconstruction speed when the field-of-view (FOV) is large. In this work, we  propose an efficient and frequency-selective PAM method for convex arrays. This  method is based on projecting the helical wave spectrum (HWS) between cylindrical  surfaces in the imaging field. Both the in silico and in vitro experiments showed  that the HWS method has comparable image quality and similar acoustic cavitation  source localization accuracy as the DAS-based methods. Compared to the  frequency-domain and time-domain DAS methods, the time-complexity of the HWS  method is reduced by one order and two orders of magnitude, respectively. A  parallel implementation of the HWS method realized millisecond-level image  reconstruction speed. We also show that the HWS method is inherently capable of  mapping microbubble (MB) cavitation activity of different status, i.e., no  cavitation, stable cavitation, or inertial cavitation.

Physical measurements showed that the amplified force was 0.7 N for  the 20 mN input radiation force, and the amplitude of the presented vibration was  over 0.1 N at 2-30 Hz.

Ultrasound (US) with microbubbles (MB)  can open biological barriers and thus improve DNA and mRNA passage. Polymeric MB  are an interesting alternative to clinically used lipid-coated MB because of  their high stability, narrow size distribution, and easy functionalization.  However, besides choosing the ideal MB, it remains unclear whether  nanocarrier-encapsulated mRNA should be administered separately  (co-administration) or conjugated to MB (co-formulation). Therefore, the impact  of poly(n-butyl cyanoacrylate) MB co-administration with mRNA-DOTAP/DOPE  lipoplexes or their co-formulation on the transfection of cancer cells in vitro  and in vivo is analyzed. Sonotransfection improved mRNA delivery into 4T1 breast  cancer cells in vitro with co-administration being more efficient than  co-formulation. In vivo, the co-administration sonotransfection approach also  resulted in higher transfection efficiency and reached deeper into the tumor  tissue. On the contrary, co-formulation mainly promoted transfection of  endothelial and perivascular cells. Furthermore, the co-formulation approach is  much more dependent on the US trigger, resulting in significantly lower off-site  transfection. Thus, the findings indicate that the choice of co-administration or  co-formulation in sonotransfection should depend on the targeted cell population,  tolerable off-site transfection, and the therapeutic purpose.","2024-02-11","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","e2306139","","","","","Adv Sci (Weinh)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024 The Authors.

Unfortunately, it lies deep to the cortex making spatially specific noninvasive access difficult. Here,  we leverage the high spatial resolution and deep penetration depth of  low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) to nonsurgically modulate the anterior  insula (AI) or posterior insula (PI) in humans for effect on subjective pain  ratings, electroencephalographic (EEG) contact heat-evoked potentials, as well as  autonomic measures including heart-rate variability (HRV). In a within-subjects,  repeated-measures, pseudo-randomized trial design, 23 healthy volunteers received  brief noxious heat pain stimuli to the dorsum of their right hand during  continuous heart-rate, electrodermal, electrocardiography and EEG recording.  Low-intensity focused ultrasound was delivered to the AI (anterior short gyrus),  PI (posterior longus gyrus), or under an inert Sham condition. The primary  outcome measure was pain rating. Low-intensity focused ultrasound to both AI and  PI similarly reduced pain ratings but had differential effects on EEG activity.  Low-intensity focused ultrasound to PI affected earlier EEG amplitudes, whereas  LIFU to AI affected later EEG amplitudes. Only LIFU to the AI affected HRV as  indexed by an increase in SD of N-N intervals and mean HRV low-frequency power.  Taken together, LIFU is an effective noninvasive method to individually target  subregions of the insula in humans for site-specific effects on brain biomarkers  of pain processing and autonomic reactivity that translates to reduced perceived  pain to a transient heat stimulus.","2024-02-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","Pain","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

By virtue of the low number of insonifications it requires,  ultrafast ultrasound enables the imaging of the human body at potentially very  high frame rates. However, unaccounted for speed-of-sound variations in the  insonified medium often result in phase aberrations in the reconstructed images.  The diagnosis capability of ultrafast ultrasound is thus ultimately impeded.  Therefore, there is a strong need for adaptive beamforming methods that are  resilient to speed-of-sound aberrations. Several of such techniques have been  proposed recently but they often lack parallelizability or the ability to  directly correct both transmit and receive phase aberrations. In this article, we  introduce an adaptive beamforming method designed to address these shortcomings.  To do so, we compute the windowed Radon transform of several complex  radio-frequency images reconstructed using delay-and-sum. Then, we apply to the  obtained local sinograms weighted tensor rank-1 decompositions and their results  are eventually used to reconstruct a corrected image. We demonstrate using  simulated and in-vitro data that our method is able to successfully recover  aberration-free images and that it outperforms both coherent compounding and the  recently introduced SVD beamformer. Finally, we validate the proposed beamforming  technique on in-vivo data, resulting in a significant improvement of image  quality compared to the two reference methods.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","135-148","","1","43","","IEEE Trans Med Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37450358","","","","*Algorithms; *Radon; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Phantoms, Imaging; Radio Waves; Ultrasonography/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This improvement is obtained by  tagging areas with focused ultrasound (fUS). Due to mechanical vibration with  respect to the measuring electrodes, the electrical activity of the marked region  will be modulated onto the ultrasonic frequency. The region's electrical activity  can subsequently be retrieved via demodulation of the measured signal. In this  study, the feasibility of this hypothesized technique is tested.Approach.This is  done by calculating the forward electroencephalography response under  quasi-static assumptions. The head is simplified as a set of concentric spheres.  Two sizes are evaluated representing human and mouse brains. Moreover,  feasibility is assessed for wet and dry transcranial, and for cortically placed  electrodes. The activity sources are modeled by dipoles, with their current  intensity profile drawn from a power-law power spectral density.Results.It is  shown that mechanical vibration modulates the endogenous activity onto the  ultrasonic frequency. The signal strength depends non-linearly on the alignment  between dipole orientation, vibration direction and recording point. The  strongest signal is measured when these three dependencies are perfectly aligned.  The signal strengths are in the pV-range for a dipole moment of 5 nAm and  ultrasonic pressures within Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-limits. The  endogenous activity can then be accurately reconstructed via demodulation. Two  interference types are investigated: vibrational and static. Depending on the  vibrational interference, it is shown that millimeter resolution signal detection  is possible also for deep brain regions. Subsequently, successful demodulation  depends on the static interference, that at MHz-range has to be  sub-picovolt.Significance.Our results show that mechanical vibration is a  possible underlying mechanism of acousto-electrophyisological neuroimaging. This  paper is a first step towards improved understanding of the conditions under  which AENI is feasible.","2024-01-04","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","6","20","","J Neural Eng","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38109769","","","","*Brain/physiology; *Electroencephalography/methods; Animals; Head; Humans; Mice; Neuroimaging; Ultrasonics; acousto-electric effect; electroencephalography; functional neuroimaging; simulation; spatial resolution; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS:  This study included patients with advanced glaucoma who underwent UCP. The main  outcome measures were intraocular pressure (IOP), the number of antiglaucoma  medications, and the presence of complications. Success was defined as an IOP  reduction ≥30% and IOP between 6 mmHg and 18 mmHg with no vision-threatening  complications. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to  identify possible predictors for failure. RESULTS: We included 65 eyes of 58  patients in the study. The mean IOP and number of antiglaucoma medications  decreased significantly from 27.60 ± 5.5 mmHg and 3.40 ± 0.9 at baseline to  17.80 ± 8.0 mmHg (35.51% reduction) and 2.43 ± 1.3 at 12 months and  17.10 ± 8.2 mmHg (38.04% reduction) and 2.41 ± 1.5 at 24 months, respectively  (p < 0.01 for both). The success rates were 66.2% (43/65) and 72.4% (21/29),  while the failure rates were 33.8% (22/65) and 27.6% (8/29) at 12 and 24 months  postoperatively, respectively. The cumulative probabilities of overall success  were 67.7 ± 5.8% and 33.8 ± 5.9% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. High baseline  IOP and history of old glaucoma surgery were associated with a higher risk for  failure (Hazard ratio = 1.10 and 5.82, p = 0.03 and p < 0.01, respectively). The  most common complications were anterior chamber reaction (18.5%) and cataract  development/progression (15.4%). Two eyes (3.1%) developed phthisis bulbi.

A prime example of this  challenge is seen in glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive and malignant  primary brain tumor. The BBB in brain tumors, or the blood-brain-tumor barrier  (BBTB), prevents the efficient delivery of most therapeutics to brain tumors.  Current strategies to overcome the BBB for therapeutic delivery, such as using  hyperosmotic agents (mannitol), have impeded progress in clinical translation  limited by the lack of spatial resolution, high incidences of complications, and  potential for toxicity. Focused ultrasound combined with intravenously  administered microbubbles enables the transient disruption of the BBB and has  progressed to early-phase clinical trials. However, the poor survival with  currently approved treatments for GBM highlights the compelling need to develop  and validate treatment strategies as well as the screening for more potent  anticancer drugs. In this protocol, we introduce an optical method to open the  BBTB (OptoBBTB) for therapeutic delivery via ultrashort pulse laser stimulation  of vascular targeting plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Specifically, the  protocol includes the synthesis and characterization of vascular-targeting AuNPs  and a detailed procedure of optoBBTB. We also report the downstream  characterization of the drug delivery and tumor treatment efficacy after BBB  modulation. Compared with other barrier modulation methods, our optical approach  has advantages in high spatial resolution and minimally invasive access to  tissues. Overall, optoBBTB allows for the delivery of a variety of therapeutics  into the brain and will accelerate drug delivery and screening for CNS disease  treatment. Key features • Pulsed laser excitation of vascular-targeting gold  nanoparticles non-invasively and reversibly modulates the blood-brain barrier  permeability. • OptoBBTB enhances drug delivery in clinically relevant  glioblastoma models. • OptoBBTB has the potential for drug screening and  evaluation for superficial brain tumor treatment.","2024-01-20","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","e4920","","2","14","","Bio Protoc","","","","","","","","eng","©Copyright : © 2024 The Authors; This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC license.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38268976  PMCID: PMC10804243","","","","Blood–brain barrier; Blood–brain–tumor barrier; Chemotherapy; Drug delivery; Glioblastoma; Nanoparticles; Pulsed laser","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While there are several studies demonstrating the ability of tFUS to modulate  neuronal activity, it is unclear whether it can be used for producing long-term  plasticity as needed to modify circuit function, especially in adult brain  circuits with limited plasticity such as the thalamocortical synapses. Here we  demonstrate that transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) stimulation  of the visual thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, dLGN), a deep brain  structure, leads to NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term depression of its  synaptic transmission onto layer 4 neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of  adult mice of both sexes. This change is not accompanied by large increases in  neuronal activity, as visualized using the cFos Targeted Recombination in Active  Populations (cFosTRAP2) mouse line, or activation of microglia, which was  assessed with IBA-1 staining. Using a model (SONIC) based on the neuronal  intramembrane cavitation excitation (NICE) theory of ultrasound neuromodulation,  we find that the predicted activity pattern of dLGN neurons upon sonication is  state-dependent with a range of activity that falls within the parameter space  conducive for inducing long-term synaptic depression. Our results suggest that  noninvasive transcranial LIFU stimulation has a potential for recovering  long-term plasticity of thalamocortical synapses in the post-critical period  adult brain.Significance Statement Recovery of adult sensory cortical function is  thought to be limited by the developmental decline in cortical plasticity  mechanisms. In particular, thalamocortical (TC) synapses in the primary sensory  cortices lose their ability to undergo experience-dependent plasticity quite  early in postnatal development. As such, recovery of adult sensory cortical  function is often accompanied by restoration of thalamocortical plasticity. Here  we used a noninvasive transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)  stimulation, which can produce neuromodulation of localized structures deep in  the brain, to elicit long-term depression of TC synapses in the primary visual  cortex of adult mice. Our results suggest that transcranial LIFU stimulation  could be a useful therapeutic that can produce long-term plasticity of neural  circuits to restore adult brain functions.","2024-02-05","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","e0784232024","","","","","J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 the authors.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38316559","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in the treatment of liver cancer,  because the tumor is located deep within the liver tissue, when ultrasound  penetrates the tissue, it will inevitably produce sound energy attenuation. This  attenuation limits the reliability of HIFU treatment, reduce the efficacy of  HIFU, and increase the risk of tumor recurrence. METHODS: Cationic microbubbles  (CMB) were successfully linked with GPC3 and HSV-TK plasmids, and targeted  gene-carrying CMB were successfully constructed. Moreover, the gene-targeted  cation microbubbles had suitable targeting and can specifically bind with liver  cancer cells. RESULTS: The HSV-TK transfection efficiency was high and had a  significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation and invasion of liver cancer  cells. After the gene-carrying cation microbubbles entered the animal body, they  had a great targeting effect in vivo. They transfected the target genes into  liver cancer cells, and the HSV-TK/GCV system initiated cell death, demonstrating  that these targeted microbubbles, enhanced HIFU treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,  CMB combined with a GPC3 antibody and HSV-TK plasmid can target residual  subcutaneous liver tumor cells under the guidance of GPC3 antibody, and kill  residual subcutaneous liver tumor cells under the action of ultrasound, thus  enhancing the therapeutic effect of HIFU on liver cancer.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","95-107","","1","43","","J Ultrasound Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37815381","","","","*Liver Neoplasms/therapy; *Microbubbles; Animals; Cations; HIFU; HSV-TK gene; Lipids; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Reproducibility of Results; nano-targeted cationic lipid microbubbles; residual liver cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is  currently limited to systems integrated within the MRI suites or requiring  post-surgical implants, thus restricting its widespread clinical adoption. In  this pilot study, we investigate the clinical safety and feasibility of a  portable, non-invasive neuronavigated FUS system with integrated real-time 2D  microbubble cavitation mapping. METHODS: A phase 1 clinical study with mild to  moderate AD patients (N=6) underwent a single session of microbubble-mediated FUS  to induce transient BBB opening (BBBO). Microbubble activity under FUS was  monitored with real-time 2-D cavitation maps and dosing to ensure the efficacy  and safety of the FUS treatment. Post-operative MRI was used for BBB opening and  closure confirmation as well as safety assessment. Changes in AD biomarker levels  in both blood serum and extracellular vesicles (EVs) were evaluated, while  changes in amyloid-beta (Aβ) load in the brain were assessed through  (18)F-Florbetapir PET. RESULTS: BBBO was achieved in 5 out of 6 subjects with an  average volume of 983±626 mm(3) following FUS at the right frontal lobe both in  white and gray matter regions. The outpatient treatment was completed within  34.8±10.7 min. Cavitation dose significantly correlated with the BBBO volume  (R(2)>0.9, N=4), demonstrating the portable FUS system's capability of predicting  opening volumes. The cavitation maps co-localized closely with the BBBO location,  representing the first report of real-time transcranial 2-D cavitation mapping in  the human brain. Larger opening volumes correlated with increased levels of AD  biomarkers, including Aβ42/Aβ40 (R(2)=0.74), Tau (R(2)=0.95), and P-Tau181  (R(2)=0.86), assayed in serum-derived EVs sampled 3 days after FUS (N=5). From  PET scans, subjects showed a lower Aβ load increase in the treated frontal lobe  region compared to the contralateral region. Reduction in asymmetry standardized  uptake value ratios (SUVR) correlated with the harmonic cavitation dose  (R(2)>0.9, N=3). Clinical changes in the mini-mental state examination over 6  months were within the expected range of cognitive decline with no additional  changes observed as a result of FUS. CONCLUSION: Safety and feasibility of this  cost-efficient and portable FUS for BBBO in AD patients were demonstrated with  real-time mapping correlating with BBBO volume and a reduction in pathology, as  well as serum detection of the AD proteins, Aβ and tau. Our study suggest the  potential for accessible FUS treatment in AD, with or without drug delivery.","2024-01-18","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: medRxiv Pages: 2023.12.21.23300222 Publication Title: medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences PMID: 38196636  PMCID: PMC10775403","","","","Alzheimer’s disease; blood–brain barrier; cavitation mapping; focused ultrasound; microbubbles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, the absence of longitudinal,  systematic, quantitative studies of microbubble shell pharmacokinetics hinders  progress within the MB-FUS field. Microbubble radiolabeling challenges contribute  to this void. This barrier is overcome by developing a one-pot, purification-free  copper chelation protocol able to stably radiolabel diverse  porphyrin-lipid-containing Definity® analogues (pDefs) with >95% efficiency while  maintaining microbubble physicochemical properties. Five tri-modal (ultrasound-,  positron emission tomography (PET)-, and fluorescent-active) [(64) Cu]Cu-pDefs  are created with varying lipid acyl chain length and charge, representing the  most prevalently studied microbubble compositions. In vitro, C16 chain length  microbubbles yield 2-3x smaller nanoprogeny than C18 microbubbles post FUS. In  vivo, [(64) Cu]Cu-pDefs are tracked in healthy and 4T1 tumor-bearing mice ± FUS  over 48 h qualitatively through fluorescence imaging (to characterize particle  disruption) and quantitatively through PET and γ-counting. These studies reveal  the impact of microbubble composition and FUS on microbubble dissolution rates,  shell circulation, off-target tissue retention (predominantly the liver and  spleen), and FUS enhancement of tumor delivery. These findings yield  pharmacokinetic microbubble structure-activity relationships that disrupt  conventional knowledge, the implications of which on MB-FUS platform design,  safety, and nanomedicine delivery are discussed.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","e2304453","","4","11","","Adv Sci (Weinh)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

This narrative review  aims to explore newer MIST for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) which are not  yet integrated into established societal guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a  literature search across PubMed, Google Scholar, and FDA ClinicalTrials.gov  databases on June 1st, 2023, to identify studies published within the past decade  exploring various MISTs for BPH. Additionally, we gathered insights from  abstracts presented in meetings of professional associations and corporate  websites. We broadly classified these procedures into three distinct categories:  energy-based, balloon dilation, and implant/stent treatments. We collected detail  information about the device, procedure details, its inclusion and exclusion  criteria, and outcome. RESULTS: Our review reveals that newer energy-based MISTs  include Transperineal Laser Ablation, Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation, and  High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound. In the sphere of balloon dilation,  Transurethral Columnar Balloon Dilation and the Optilume BPH Catheter System were  gaining momentum. The noteworthy implants/stents that are on horizon include  Butterfly Prostatic Retraction Device, Urocross Expander System, Zenflow Spring  System, and ProVee Urethral Expander System. CONCLUSION: The exploration of  various MISTs reflects ongoing efforts to enhance patient care and address  limitations of existing treatments. This review provides a bird-eye view and  valuable insights for urologists and researchers seeking to navigate the dynamic  landscape of MISTs in the quest for effective and minimally invasive solutions  for enlarged prostates.","2024-01-13","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","35","","1","42","","World J Urol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024.

Therapeutic ultrasound like high-intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablates tissues while low-intensity pulsed ultrasound  (LIPU) promotes healing at relatively low temperatures. However, blood vessel  cooling effect and reduced flow in ischemia impact temperature distribution and  ultrasonic treatment efficacy. This work established a rabbit limb ischemia model  by ligating the femoral artery, measuring vascular changes and temperature rise  during LIPU exposures. Results showed the artery diameter was narrowed by 46.2%  and the downstream velocity was reduced by 51.3% after ligation. Finite element  simulations verified that the reduced flow velocity impaired heat dissipation,  enhancing LIPU-induced heating. Simulation results also suggested the temperature  rise was almost related linearly to vessel diameter but decayed exponentially  with the increasing flow velocity. Findings indicate that the proposed model  could be used as an effectively tool to model the heating effects in ischemic  tissues during LIPU treatment. This research on relating varied ischemic flow to  LIPU-induced thermal effects is significant for developing safe and efficacious  clinical ultrasound hyperthermia treatment protocols for the patients with  ischemic diseases.","2024-02-10","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","107263","","","138","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Imaging of an  agar-based MRI phantom was performed in a 3 T MRI scanner utilizing T2-Weighted  Fast Spin Echo (FSE) and Fast low angle shot (FLASH) sequences, which are  typically employed for high resolution anatomical imaging and thermometry,  respectively. Reference magnitude and phase images of the phantom were compared  with images acquired in the presence of each transducer in terms of the signal to  noise ratio (SNR), introduced artifacts, and overall image quality. RESULTS: The  degree of observed artifacts highly differed among the various transducers. The  transducer whose backing material included magnetic impurities showed poor  performance in the MRI, introducing significant susceptibility artifacts such as  geometric distortions and signal void bands. Additionally, it caused the most  significant SNR drop. Other transducers were shown to exhibit high level of MRI  compatibility as the resulting images closely resembled the reference images with  minimal to no apparent artifacts and comparable SNR values.

METHODS: The thalamus and hypothalamus of wild-type mice were sonicated with a  continuous-wave, 2 MHz FUS transducer at pressures of 425 and 850 kPa for 60  seconds. Cardiac and respiratory rates were monitored as signs of autonomic  nervous activity. FUS-induced changes in autonomic activity were compared to FUS  targeted to a spatially-distant motor region and to laser-induced heating.  RESULTS: FUS delivered to the primary target over the thalamus and hypothalamus  at 850 kPa reversibly increased the respiratory rate by 6.5±3.2 breaths per  minute and decreased the heart rate by 3.2±1.8 beats per minute. No significant  changes occurred in this region at 425 kPa or when targeting the motor regions at  850 kPa. Laser heating with the same temperature rise profile produced by 850 kPa  sonication resulted in cardiorespiratory modulation similar to that of FUS.  CONCLUSIONS: FUS is capable of reversibly and non-invasively modulating  cardiorespiratory activity in mice. Localized changes in temperature may  constitute the main cause for this activity, though further investigation is  warranted into the distinct and complementary mechanisms of mechanically- and  thermally-induced FUS neuromodulation. Close monitoring of vital signs during FUS  neuromodulation may be warranted to monitor systemic responses to stimulation.","2024-03","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","332-340","","3","50","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

The average ablation rate for all the tumors was 51.5 ± 26.7%. The  level of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT) was mildly increased in 71.6%  (12/17) of patients after HIFU therapy. Mean ALT values before and after  treatment were 22 (14, 35) U/L and 36 (25, 41) U/L, respectively (Z = 1.947,  p = 0.051). Mild or obvious edema in skin and subcutaneous soft tissues were  observed in 76.5% of patients, but no serious side effects were found. Twelve  months after treatment, the follow-up results revealed that 1 patient (5.8%)  achieved a CR, 8 patients (47.1%) had SD and 8 patients (47.1%) had progressive  disease. The estimated median time to progression was 11 mo after treatment, with  a 95% confidence interval of 6, 11 for all involved patients. CONCLUSION: Use of  Sonazoid is safe and feasible for improving HIFU ablation efficiency during the  treatment of advanced malignant liver lesions. The therapeutic efficacy of  Sonazoid-assisted HIFU needs to be explored in additional controlled clinical  investigations.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","134-141","","1","50","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

The resulting displacement,  assumed to be inversely proportional to the tissue local stiffness, is estimated  using an imaging array based on RF speckle tracking. In conventional HMI, this is  accomplished with plane-wave (PW) imaging, which inherently suffers from low  lateral resolution. Coherent PW compounding (PWC) leverages spatial and temporal  resolution using synthetic focusing in transmit. In this study, we introduced  focused imaging with parallel tracking in HMI and compared parallel tracking of  various transmit F-numbers (F/2.6, 3, 4, and 5) qualitatively and quantitatively  with PW and PWC imaging at various compounded angle ranges (6°, 12°, and 18°). An  in silico model of a 56-kPa spherical inclusion (diameter: 3.6 mm) embedded in a  5.3-kPa background and a 5.3-kPa elastic phantom with cylindrical inclusions  (Young's moduli: 22-56 kPa, diameters: 2.0-8.6 mm) were imaged to assess  different tracking beam sequences. Speckle biasing in displacement estimation  associated with parallel tracking was also investigated and concluded to be  negligible in HMI. Parallel tracking in receive (Rx) resulted in 2%-7% and 8%-12%  increase compared to PW imaging ( ) in HMI contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio  in silico and phantoms. Focused imaging with parallel tracking in Rx was  concluded to be most robust among PW and PWC imaging for displacement estimation,  and its preclinical feasibility was demonstrated in postsurgical human cancerous  breast tissue specimens and in vivo murine models of breast cancer.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","102-116","","1","71","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37917522  PMCID: PMC10871064","","","","*Breast Neoplasms; *Elasticity Imaging Techniques/methods; Animals; Elastic Modulus; Female; Humans; Mice; Motion; Phantoms, Imaging; Ultrasonography/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A multicentre, randomised, sham-controlled, blinded  trial was conducted. A cohort of 176 eligible participants, who had normal  prenatal check-ups and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were recruited  from three medical centres and subsequently randomized into either the LIFU or  sham group. All participants received three treatment sessions, wherein LIFU  signal was applied to the uterus and breast sites using coupling gel, with the  absence of ultrasound signal output in the sham group. Fundal height measurement  and breast pain score were performed after each treatment. The primary outcome,  uterine involution, was presented by measuring the fundal height of the uterus.  The visual analogue scale (VAS) score, as a secondary outcome, was used to assess  breast pain and determine the correlation between breast pain and fundal height  as the outcome simultaneously. All participants were randomly assigned to either  the LIFU group (n = 88) or sham group (n = 88), with seven individuals not  completing the treatment. Overall, a statistically significant difference was  noted in the rate and index of fundus descent after each treatment. The rate and  index of fundus descent showed greater significance following the second  treatment (rate: 1.5 (1.0, 2.0) cm/d; index: 0.15 (0.1, 0.18), P < 0.001) and  third treatment (rate: 1.67 (1.33, 2.0) cm/d; index: 0.26 (0.23, 0.3), P < 0.001)  in the LIFU group. VAS scores, which were based on the continuous variables for  the baseline, first, second, and third treatments in the LIFU group (2.0 (2.0,  3.0), 1.0 (0.0, 2.0), 0.0 (0.0, 1.0), and 0.0 (0.0, 0.0) points, respectively),  and the sham group (2.0 (2.0, 2.0), 2.0 (1.0, 2.0), 2.0 (1.0, 3.0), and 3.0 (1.0,  3.0) points, respectively), showed a statistically significant difference between  the two groups. Meanwhile, the discrepancies in VAS score classification  variables between the two groups were statistically significant. After the third  treatment, a notable correlation was observed between the VAS score decrease and  fundus descent rate; the more the VAS score decreased, the faster was the fundal  decline rate in the LIFU group. LIFU therapy is safe and effective, contributing  to the acceleration of uterine involution and the relief of postpartum breast  pain.Trial ID The study has registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry  (ChiCTR2100049586) at 05/08/2021.","2024-01-05","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","658","","1","14","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024.

Various nursing  education methods need to be developed alongside new treatment methods and their  effects should be clinically verified. Nursing intervention using VR has recently  been attempted. The study comprises a pre- and post-test design with a  non-equivalent control group. We assigned 54 women to experimental (n = 26) and  control (n = 28) groups. The patients were diagnosed with benign uterine tumors  and were treated with HIFU at two women's hospitals in D city. Data collected  from these hospitals were analyzed using descriptive statistics, a pre-test of  homogeneity, independent t-tests, and repeated measures analysis of variance. In  the experimental group, uncertainty (t = 4.26, p < 0.001) and anxiety (t = 4.09,  p < 0.001) were significantly lower compared to the control group. However,  nursing satisfaction was significantly higher in the experimental group than in  the control group (t = -4.50, p < 0.001).

Calcium imaging or other forms  of functional fluorescence imaging are central solutions for monitoring cortical  neural responses to targeted neuromodulation, but often are confounded by thermal  effects that are inter-mixed with neural responses. AIM: Here, we develop and  demonstrate a method for effectively suppressing fluorescent thermal transients  from calcium responses. APPROACH: We use high precision phased-array 3 MHz  focused ultrasound delivery integrated with fiberscope-based widefield  fluorescence to monitor cortex-wide calcium changes. Our approach for detecting  the neural activation first takes advantage of the high inter-hemispheric  correlation of resting state Ca2+ dynamics and then removes the  ultrasound-induced thermal effect by subtracting its simulated spatio-temporal  signature from the processed profile. RESULTS: The focused 350  μm-sized  ultrasound stimulus triggered rapid localized activation events dominated by  transient thermal responses produced by ultrasound. By employing bioheat equation  to model the ultrasound heat deposition, we can recover putative neural responses  to ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: The developed method for canceling transient thermal  fluorescence quenching could also find applications with optical stimulation  techniques to monitor thermal effects and disentangle them from neural responses.  This approach may help deepen our understanding of the mechanisms and macroscopic  effects of ultrasound neuromodulation, further paving the way for tailoring the  stimulation regimes toward specific applications.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","014413","","1","11","","Neurophotonics","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024 The Authors.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38371339  PMCID: PMC10871046","","","","calcium imaging; mouse brain; neuroimaging; thermal effects; ultrasound neuromodulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND  METHODS: One hundred eighty-nine patients with adenomyosis were treated with  HIFU. The ablation areas on T2WI and DWI sequences were classified into different  types: type I, relatively ill-defined rim or unrecognizable; subtype IIa,  well-defined rim with hyperintensity; subtype IIb, well-defined rim with  hypointensity. The volume of ablation areas on T2WI (V(T2WI)) and DWI (V(DWI))  was measured and compared with the non-perfused volume (NPV), and linear  regression was conducted to analyze their correlation with NPV. RESULTS: The  V(T2WI) of type I and type II (subtype IIa and subtype IIb) were statistically  different from the corresponding NPV (p = 0.004 and 0.024, respectively), while  no significant difference was found between the V(DWI) of type I and type II with  NPV (p = 0.478 and 0.561, respectively).

However, the injection of gadolinium with its potential adverse effect is of  concern in CE and therefore, it deserves efforts to find a better imaging method  without the need for contrast agent injection for this task. OBJECTIVE: To assess  the role of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in evaluating the immediate  therapeutic response of HIFU treatment for uterine fibroids in comparison with  CE. METHODS: 68 patients with 74 uterine fibroids receiving HIFU treatment were  enrolled, and immediate treatment response was assessed using post-surgical DWI  images. Semi-quantitative ordinal ablation quality grading and quantitative  nonperfusion volume (NPV) measurement based on DWI and CE imaging were determined  by two experienced radiologists. Agreement of ablation quality grading between  DWI and CE was assessed using the weighted kappa coefficient, while  intraobserver, interobserver and interprotocol agreements of NPV measurements  within and between DWI and CE were evaluated using the intraclass correlation  (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Grading of immediate HIFU treatment  response showed a moderate agreement between DWI and CE (weighted kappa = 0.446,  p < 0.001). NPV measured in 65 fibroids with DWI of Grade 3~5 showed very high  ICCs for the intraobserver and interobserver agreement within DWI and CE (all ICC  > 0.980, p < 0.001) and also for the interprotocol agreement between DWI and CE  (ICC = 0.976, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: DWI could provide satisfactory ablation  quality grading, and reliable NPV quantification results to assess immediate  therapeutic responses of HIFU treatment for uterine fibroids in most cases, which  suggests that non-contrast enhanced DWI might be potentially used as a more  costeffective and convenient method in a large proportion of patients for this  task replacing CE imaging.","2024-02-27","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","Curr Med Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 38415459","","","","Ablation quality grading; Contrast enhanced imaging; Diffusion-weighted imaging; Magnetic resonance imaging; Nonperfusion volume; Uterine fibroid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the absence of comparative studies involving  various quantitative ultrasound imaging techniques hinders further clinical  exploration. In this study, we simultaneously reconstructed ultrasonic Nakagami  imaging, ultrasonic horizontally normalized Shannon entropy (hNSE) imaging, and  ultrasonic differential attenuation coefficient intercept (DACI) imaging from  ultrasound backscattered envelope data collected during high-intensity focused  ultrasound ablation treatment. We comprehensively investigated their performance  differences through qualitative and quantitative analyses, including the  calculation of contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) for ultrasonic images, receiver  operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with corresponding indicators, the  analysis of lesion area fitting relationships, and computational time consumption  comparison. The mean CNR of hNSE imaging was 10.98 ± 4.48 dB, significantly  surpassing the 3.82 ± 1.40 dB (p < 0.001, statistically significant) of Nakagami  imaging and the 2.45 ± 0.74 dB (p < 0.001, statistically significant) of DACI  imaging. This substantial difference underscores that hNSE imaging offers the  highest contrast resolution for lesion recognition. Furthermore, we evaluated the  ability of multiple ultrasonic parametric imaging to detect thermal ablation  lesions using ROC curves. The area under the curve (AUC) for hNSE was 0.874,  exceeding the values of 0.848 for Nakagami imaging and 0.832 for DACI imaging.  Additionally, hNSE imaging exhibited the strongest linear correlation coefficient  (R = 0.92) in the comparison of lesion area fitting, outperforming Nakagami  imaging (R = 0.87) and DACI imaging (R = 0.85). hNSE imaging also performs best  in real-time monitoring with each frame taking 6.38 s among multiple ultrasonic  parametric imaging. Our findings unequivocally demonstrate that hNSE imaging  excels in monitoring HIFU ablation treatment and holds the greatest potential for  further clinical exploration.","2024-02-27","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","107274","","","139","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

Cessation of the offending drug can be difficult,  and many medical treatments for drug-induced tremor are ineffective. Deep brain  stimulation (DBS) has been shown in a limited number of case reports to  effectively reduce drug-induced tremor, however, which remains an invasive  therapeutic option. MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy is an  FDA-approved non-invasive treatment for essential tremor (ET). To the best of our  knowledge, MRgFUS thalamotomy has never been reported to treat drug-induced  tremor. Here, we present a case of a left-handed 55-year-old man with a  progressive, medically refractory lithium-induced tremor of the bilateral upper  extremities. The patient underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy targeting the right ventral  intermediate nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus to treat the left hand. There was  almost complete resolution of his left-hand tremor immediately following MRgFUS.  There were no side effects. The patient continues to show excellent tremor  control at 90-day follow-up and remains free from side effects. This case  demonstrates MRgFUS thalamotomy as a possible novel treatment option to treat  drug-induced tremor.","2023","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","1331241","","","14","","Front Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 Gelman, Melott, Thakur, Tarabishy, Brandt, Konrad, Ranjan and Memon.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38362012  PMCID: PMC10867204","","","","MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS); case report; high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU); lithium; tremor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies of the interaction of sound with neurons support the hypothesis that  mechanosensitive ion channels play an important role in ultrasound  neuromodulation. The response of cells other than neurons (e.g., astrocytes,  pericytes and endothelial cells) have not been fully characterized, despite  playing an important role in brain function. METHODS: To address this gap in  knowledge, we examined cultured murine primary cortical neurons, astrocytes,  endothelial cells and pericytes in an in vitro widefield microscopy setup during  application of a 500 ms burst of 250 kHz focused ultrasound over a pressure range  known to elicit neuromodulation. We examined cell membrane health in response to  a range of pulses and used optical calcium indicators in conjunction with  pharmacological antagonists to selectively block different groups of thermo- and  mechanosensitive ion channels known to be responsive to ultrasound. RESULTS: All  cell types experienced an increase in calcium fluorescence in response to  ultrasound. Gadolinium (Gad), 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and ruthenium  red (RR) reduced the percentage of responding neurons and magnitude of response.  The percentage of astrocytes responding was significantly lowered only by Gad,  whereas both 2-APB and Gad decreased the amplitude of the fluorescence response.  2-APB decreased the percentage of responding endothelial cells, whereas only Gad  reduced the magnitude of responses. Pericytes exposed to RR or Gad were less  likely to respond to stimulation. RR had no detectable effect on the magnitude of  the pericyte responses while 2-APB and Gad significantly decreased the  fluorescence intensity, despite not affecting the percentage responding.  CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the role of non-neuronal cells during FUS  neuromodulation. All of the investigated cell types are sensitive to mechanical  ultrasound stimulation and rely on mechanosensitive ion channels to undergo  ultrasound neuromodulation.","2024-03","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","341-351","","3","50","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023.

METHODS: A total  of 105 patients with desmoid fibromatosis (79 females, 26 males; 35 ± 14 years)  were treated with MRgFUS between 2011 and 2021 in three centers. Total and viable  tumors were evaluated per patient at last follow-up after treatment. Response and  progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed with (modified) response evaluation  criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v.1.1 and mRECIST). Change in Numerical Rating  Scale (NRS) pain and 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores were  compared. Treatment-related adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: The median  initial tumor volume was 114 mL (IQR 314 mL). After MRgFUS, median total and  viable tumor volume decreased to 51 mL (95% CI: 30-71 mL, n = 101, p < 0.0001)  and 29 mL (95% CI: 17-57 mL, n = 88, p < 0.0001), respectively, at last follow-up  (median: 15 months, 95% CI: 11-20 months). Based on total tumor measurements  (RECIST), 86% (95% CI: 75-93%) had at least stable disease or better at last  follow-up, but 50% (95% CI: 38-62%) of remaining viable nodules (mRECIST)  progressed within the tumor. Median PFS was reached at 17 and 13 months for total  and viable tumors, respectively. NRS decreased from 6 (IQR 3) to 3 (IQR 4) (p <  0.001). SF-36 scores improved (physical health (41 (IQR 15) to 46 (IQR 12); p =  0.05, and mental health (49 (IQR 17) to 53 (IQR 9); p = 0.02)). Complications  occurred in 36%, most commonly 1(st)/2(nd) degree skin burns.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE  STATEMENT: Imaging-guided ablation is being increasingly used as an alternative  to surgery, radiation, and medical therapy for the treatment of desmoid  fibromatosis. MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound is an incisionless  ablation technique that can be used to reduce tumor burden effectively and  safely. KEY POINTS: • Desmoid fibromatosis was treated with MR-guided  high-intensity focused ultrasound in 105 patients. • MR-guided focused ultrasound  ablation reduced tumor volume and pain and improved quality of life. • MR-guided  focused ultrasound is a treatment option for patients with extra-abdominal  desmoid tumors.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","1137-1145","","2","34","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

The less  invasive nature of FUS makes its early application in PD feasible. We aim to  assess the safety and efficacy of unilateral FUS-STN in patients with PD of less  than 5 years from diagnosis (early PD). METHODS: Prospective, open-label study.  Eligible patients with early PD had highly asymmetrical cardinal features. The  primary outcome was safety, defined as treatment-related adverse events at 6  months. Secondary outcomes included efficacy, assessed as motor improvement in  the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale  (MDS-UPDRS), motor fluctuations, non-motor symptoms, daily living activities,  quality of life, medication and patients' impression of change. RESULTS: Twelve  patients with PD (median age 52.0 (IQR 49.8-55.3) years, median time from  diagnosis 3.0 (2.1-3.9) years) underwent unilateral FUS-STN. Within 2 weeks after  treatment, five patients developed dyskinesia on the treated side, all resolved  after levodopa dose adjustment. One patient developed mild contralateral motor  weakness which fully resolved in 4 weeks. One patient developed dystonic foot and  another hand and foot dystonia. The latter impaired gait and became functionally  disabling initially. Both cases were well controlled with botulinum toxin  injections. The off-medication motor MDS-UPDRS score for the treated side  improved at 12 months by 68.7% (from 14.5 to 4.0, p=0.002), and the total motor  MDS-UPDRS improved by 49.0% (from 26.5 to 13.0, p=0.002). Eleven patients (92%)  reported global improvement 12 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: Unilateral  FUS-STN may be safe and effective to treat motor manifestations in patients with  early PD.

Ultrasonic and thermal modelling  conducted as part of the treatment planning process requires acoustic property  values for all constituent tissues, but the literature contains no data for the  human pancreas. PURPOSE: This study presents the first acoustic property  measurements of human pancreatic samples and provides examples of how these  properties impact a broad range of ultrasound therapies. METHODS: Data were  collected on human pancreatic tissue samples at physiological temperature from 23  consented patients in cooperation with a hospital pathology laboratory.  Propagation of ultrasound over the 2.1-4.5 MHz frequency range through samples of  various thicknesses and pathologies was measured using a set of custom-built  ultrasonic calipers, with the data processed to estimate sound speed and  attenuation. The results were used in acoustic and thermal simulations to  illustrate the impacts on extracorporeal ultrasound therapies for mild  hyperthermia, thermal ablation, and histotripsy implemented with a CE-marked  clinical system operating at 0.96 MHz. RESULTS: The mean sound speed and  attenuation coefficient values for human samples were well below the range of  values in the literature for non-human pancreata, while the human attenuation  power law exponents were substantially higher. The simulated impacts on  ultrasound mediated therapies for the pancreas indicated that when using the  human data instead of the literature average, there was a 30% reduction in median  temperature elevation in the treatment volume for mild hyperthermia and 43%  smaller volume within a 60°C contour for thermal ablation, all driven by  attenuation. By comparison, impacts on boiling and intrinsic threshold  histotripsy were minor, with peak pressures changing by less than 15% (positive)  and 1% (negative) as a consequence of the counteracting effects of attenuation  and sound speed. CONCLUSION: This study provides the most complete set of speed  of sound and attenuation data available for the human pancreas, and it reiterates  the importance of acoustic material properties in the planning and conduct of  ultrasound-mediated procedures, particularly thermal therapies.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","809-825","","2","51","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

This study  aims to overcome this problem using a one-dimensional (1D) deep convolutional  neural network. APPROACH: U-Net-based networks have been proven to be effective  in image reconstruction and denoising, and the two-dimensional (2D) U-Net has  already been investigated for suppressing HIFU interference in ultrasound  monitoring images. In this study, we propose that the one-dimensional (1D)  convolution in U-Net-based networks is more suitable for removing HIFU artifacts  and can better recover the contaminated B-mode images compared to 2D convolution.  Ex-vivo and in-vivo HIFU experiments were performed on a clinically equivalent  ultrasound-guided HIFU platform to collect image data, and the 1D convolution in  U-Net, Attention U-Net, U-Net++, and FUS-Net was applied to verify our proposal.  MAIN RESULTS: All 1D U-Net-based networks were more effective in suppressing HIFU  interference than their 2D counterparts, with over 30% improvement in terms of  structural similarity (SSIM) to the uncontaminated B-mode images. Additionally,  1D U-Nets trained using ex-vivo datasets demonstrated better generalization  performance in in-vivo experiments. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that  the utilization of 1D convolution in U-Net-based networks offers great potential  in addressing the challenges of monitoring in ultrasound-guided HIFU systems.","2024-02-21","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38382109","","","","1D U-Net; HIFU therapy; US-guide HIFU; deep learning; high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) interference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose To assess the 2-year oncological and functional outcomes of men with  intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) treated with targeted FT. Materials and  Methods In this single-center prospective phase II trial, men with localized  unifocal intermediate-risk PCa underwent transrectal MRI-guided focused  ultrasound between July 2016 and July 2019. Planned ablation volumes included  10-mm margins when possible. Data regarding adverse events were collected and  quality-of-life questionnaires were completed by participants at 6 weeks and at  5, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. Multiparametric MRI and targeted and  systematic biopsies were performed at 24 months. Ablation volumes were determined  by manual contouring of nonperfused volumes on immediate contrast-enhanced  images. Generalized estimating equations were used to model trends in  quality-of-life measures. Results Treatment was successfully completed in the 44  participants (median age, 67 years; IQR, 62-70 years; 36 patients with grade  group [GG] 2; eight patients with GG 3). No major adverse events from treatment  were recorded. One participant refused biopsy at 24 months. After 2 years, 39 of  43 participants (91%) had no csPCa at the treatment site and 36 of 43 (84%) had  no cancer in the entire gland. No changes in International Index of Erectile  Function-15 score or International Prostate Symptom Score were observed during  2-year follow-up (P = .73 and .39, respectively).

Pancreatic cancer has become the third  leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and there is still a  lack of effective treatments to improve patient survival rate. Hence, the purpose  of the present retrospective study was to assess the potential clinical impact of  repeated high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) combined with iodine-125  ((125)I) interstitial brachytherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced  pancreatic cancer who were ineligible for or declined surgery and chemotherapy. A  total of 52 patients diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer were included in  the study. At least one course of HIFU therapy combined with percutaneous  ultrasound-guided (125)I seed implantation was administered to each patient. The  clinical assessment included an evaluation of Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS)  score at baseline, and at 1 and 2 months after combined therapy. Pain intensity  was additionally evaluated with the numerical rating score (NRS). Overall  survival (OS) times and survival rates at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after combined  treatment were evaluated. Adverse events commonly associated with HIFU and (125)I  seed implantation were recorded, and the severity of adverse events was graded  according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4. All  52 patients received successful repeated HIFU treatment combined with (125)I seed  implantation and were included in the analysis of efficacy and safety. The median  OS time of patients was estimated to be 13.1 months (95% CI, 11.3-14.8). The  survival rates at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were 100.0, 86.5, 61.5 and 53.8%,  respectively. The mean KPS score was 62.7±6.3 at baseline, 73.7±7.9 at 1 month  and 68.8±6.5 at 2 months after combined treatment. KPS score increased  significantly after combined therapy. The mean NRS score was 6.7±1.6 at baseline,  and 4.7±1.7 and 5.4±1.5 at 1 and 2 months after combined treatment, respectively.  The number of patients with severe pain and the NRS score were both significantly  lower at 1 and 2 months after (125)I seed implantation compared with those at  baseline. No serious complications were detected during the follow-up period.

These losses can be  significantly mitigated through sonication geometry planning, patient  positioning, and aberration correction using multielement phased arrays. Here, a  sonication planning algorithm is introduced, which uses the simulations to select  the optimal transducer position and evaluate the effect of aberrations and  acoustic field quality at the target region after aberration correction.  Optimization of transducer positioning is implemented using a graphical user  interface (GUI) to visualize a segmented 3-D computed tomography (CT)-based  acoustic model of the body and to select sonication geometry through a  combination of manual and automated approaches. An HIFU array (1.5 MHz, 256  elements) and three renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cases with different tumor  locations and patient body habitus were considered. After array positioning, the  correction of aberrations was performed using a combination of backpropagation  from the focus with an ordinary least squares (OLS) optimization of phases at the  array elements. The forward propagation was simulated using a combination of the  Rayleigh integral and k-space pseudospectral method (k-Wave toolbox). After  correction, simulated HIFU fields showed tight focusing and up to threefold  higher maximum pressure within the target region. The addition of OLS  optimization to the aberration correction method yielded up to 30% higher maximum  pressure compared to the conventional backpropagation and up to 250% higher  maximum pressure compared to the ray-tracing method, particularly in strongly  distorted cases.","2024-03","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","341-353","","3","71","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38231825","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Kidney Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Acoustics; Algorithms; Humans; Transducers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study directed low-intensity tFUS  stimulation onto a region of prefrontal cortex (the frontal eye field, or FEF) of  a rhesus macaque to examine its impact on a remote site, the extrastriate visual  cortex (area V4). This pair of cortical regions form a top-down modulatory  circuit that has been studied extensively with electrical microstimulation. To  measure the impact of tFUS stimulation, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs)  and multi-unit spiking activities from a multi-electrode array implanted in the  visual cortex. To deliver tFUS stimulation, we leveraged a customized 128-element  random array ultrasound transducer with improved spatial targeting. We observed  that tFUS stimulation in FEF produced modulation of V4 neuronal activity, either  through enhancement or suppression, dependent on the pulse repetition frequency  of the tFUS stimulation. Electronically steering the transcranial ultrasound  focus through the targeted FEF cortical region produced changes in the level of  modulation, indicating that the tFUS stimulation was spatially targeted within  FEF. Modulation of V4 activity was confined to specific frequency bands, and this  modulation was dependent on the presence or absence of a visual stimulus during  tFUS stimulation. A control study targeting the insula produced no effect,  emphasizing the region-specific nature of tFUS neuromodulation. Our findings shed  light on the capacity of tFUS to modulate specific neural pathways and provide a  comprehensive understanding of its potential applications for neuromodulation  within brain networks.","2024-01-22","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: bioRxiv Pages: 2024.01.20.576476 Publication Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology PMID: 38328120  PMCID: PMC10849517","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This treatment method significantly alleviates  disease-related symptoms and reduces pancreatic tumor volume. However, the  current body of evidence is constrained by a lack of randomized controlled  trials. The utilization of USgHIFU is primarily indicated for patients with  unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic pancreatic cancer, particularly  those experiencing symptoms due to a locally advanced primary tumor.Methods: This  collaborative consensus paper, involving European and Chinese HIFU centers  treating pancreatic cancer, delineates criteria for patient selection, focusing  on those most likely to benefit from USgHIFU treatment. Consideration is given to  endpoints encompassing symptom alleviation, local response rates, other  oncological outcomes, as well as overall and progression-free survival.  Additionally, this paper defines relevant contraindications, side effects, and  complications associated with USgHIFU. The publication also explores the  feasibility and role of USgHIFU within the context of palliative care, including  standard systemic chemotherapy.Results: The non-invasive local treatment of  advanced pancreatic cancer using HIFU should be regarded as an adjunctive option  alongside systemic chemotherapy or best supportive care for managing this  aggressive disease. Based on the ability of USgHIFU therapy to mitigate pain and  reduce primary tumor volume, it should be considered as a complementary therapy  for symptomatic patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer and as a potential  means of tumor debulking. The underutilized yet promising USgHIFU exhibits the  potential to enhance patients' quality of life by alleviating cancer-related  pain. Experts in the field should evaluate this treatment option be evaluated by  experts in this field, with this consensus paper potentially serving as a guiding  resource for the medical community.Conclusions: US-guided HIFU for advanced  pancreatic cancer addresses treatment goals, available options, success rates,  and limitations. As a non-invasive, effective local therapy, complementary to  chemotherapy and best supportive care, it plays a pivotal role in pain relief,  reducing of tumor volume, and potentially improving survival rates.","2024","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","2295812","","1","41","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38159562","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/therapy; China; Consensus; Humans; Pain/etiology; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome; US-guided HIFU; expert consensus; pancreatic cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, its long-term outcomes and  prognostic factors remain unclear. This study aimed to retrospectively  investigate 38 patients with ET who underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy and were  followed up for >2 years. The improvement in tremor was evaluated using the  Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST). Adverse events were documented, and  correlations with factors, such as skull density ratio (SDR), maximum mean  temperature (T-max), and lesion size, were examined. Furthermore, the outcomes  were compared between two groups, one that met the cutoff values, which was  previously reported (preoperative CRST-B ≤ 25, T-max ≥ 52.5°C, anterior-posterior  size of lesion ≥ 3.9 mm, superior-inferior [SI] size of lesion > 5.5 mm), and the  other that did not. The improvement rate was 59.4% on average at the 2-year  follow-up. Adverse events, such as numbness (15.8%), dysarthria (10.5%), and  lower extremity weakness (2.6%), were observed even after 2 years, although these  were mild. The factors correlated with tremor improvement were the T-max and SI  size of the lesion (p < 0.05), whereas the SDR showed no significance. Patients  who met the aforementioned cutoff values demonstrated a 69.8% improvement at the  2-year follow-up, whereas others showed a 43.6% improvement (p < 0.05). In  conclusion, MRgFUS is effective even after 2 years. The higher the T-max and the  larger the lesion size, the better the tremor control. Previously reported cutoff  values clearly predict the 2-year prognosis, indicating the usefulness of MRgFUS.","2024-02-15","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","Neurol Med Chir (Tokyo)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 38355128","","","","ablation; essential tremor; focused ultrasound; outcome; prognostic factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  BBB prevents the permeation of many molecular therapies into the brain  parenchyma, where the cancer cells reside. Focused ultrasound (FUS) with  microbubbles has recently emerged as an innovative and exciting technology that  non-invasively permeabilizes the BBB in a small focal region with millimeter  precision.

A total of 119 patients with  adenomyosis who received HIFU therapy were retrospectively analyzed. Participants  were included in the training and testing queues in a 7:3 ratio. Radiomics  features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) images, and VGG-19 was  used to extract advanced deep features. An ensemble model based on multi-model  fusion for predicting the efficacy of HIFU in adenomyosis was proposed, which  consists of four base classifiers and was evaluated using accuracy, precision,  recall, F-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  (AUC). The predictive performance of the combined model combining radiomics and  deep learning features outperformed the radiomics and deep learning feature  models alone, with accuracy of 0.848 and 0.814 in training and test sets, and AUC  of 0.916 and 0.861, respectively.

Its impact on aged populations, who are vulnerable to insufficient healing after  muscle injury because of sarcopenia, is understudied. Despite the coupling  between muscle inflammation and regeneration, research on the immune response  after therapeutic ultrasound is limited. The objective of this study was to  evaluate structure, inflammatory cytokine signaling and immune cell infiltration  after therapeutic ultrasound in young and aging murine muscle. METHODS: Young  (6-week-old) and Adult (52-week-old) male and female mouse non-injured  gastrocnemii were treated with either low-intensity pulsed ultrasound at 2  W/cm(2) (∼0.243 MPa) or high-intensity pulsed focused ultrasound at 554 W/cm(2)  (∼5.96 MPa). Cytokine expression was evaluated at 1, 8 and 24 hours, cell  infiltration was measured via flow cytometry at 1 and 24 hours and  immunofluorescence assessed muscle fiber area, fibrosis and satellite cells at 24  hours after sonication. RESULTS: Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound induced an  early, transient inflammatory response where interleukin (IL)-15 and macrophages  (M2 > M1) were increased 1 hour post-sonication. High-intensity pulsed focused  ultrasound caused a late, extended immune response where monocyte chemoattractant  protein 1 (MCP-1), neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages (M1 > M2) were  increased 24 hours post-sonication. Notably, these changes manifested solely in  Young gastrocnemius. The Adult gastrocnemius exhibited decreased cytokine  expression (IL-1α, IL-6, IL-15, macrophage colony-stimulating factor [M-CSF]) and  no alteration in immune cell recruitment post-sonication. There was no damage to  muscle structure. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic ultrasound induced a pressure-dependent  inflammatory response that can augment or mitigate intrinsic muscle cytokine  signaling and cell recruitment in adolescent or aged muscle, respectively.","2024-04","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","494-501","","4","50","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Published by Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38218683","","","","*Cytokines/metabolism; *Monocytes/metabolism; Aging; Animals; Female; Flow cytometry; Focused ultrasound; Immunity; Immunology; Low-intensity ultrasound; Macrophages/metabolism; Male; Mice; Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism; Skeletal muscle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the lower cavitation threshold  of microbubbles can potentially yield off-target damage that the polydispersity  of clinical agent may further exacerbate. Here we investigate the use of a  monodisperse nanodroplet formulation for achieving antivascular effects in  tumors. We first develop stable low boiling point monodisperse lipid nanodroplets  and examine them as an alternative agent to mediate antivascular ultrasound. With  synchronous intravital imaging and ultrasound monitoring of focused  ultrasound-stimulated nanodroplets in tumor microvasculature, we show that  nanodroplets can trigger blood flow shutdown and do so with a sharper pressure  threshold and with fewer additional events than conventionally used microbubbles.  We further leverage the smaller size and prolonged pharmacokinetic profile of  nanodroplets to allow for potential passive accumulation in tumor tissue prior to  antivascular ultrasound, which may be a means by which to promote selective tumor  targeting. We find that vascular shutdown is accompanied by inertial cavitation  and complex-order sub- and ultraharmonic acoustic signatures, presenting an  opportunity for effective feedback control of antivascular ultrasound.","2024-01-09","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","410-427","","1","18","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38147452  PMCID: PMC10786165","","","","*Neoplasms; Acoustics; Humans; Intravital Microscopy; Microbubbles; Microvessels/diagnostic imaging; Ultrasonography; antivascular ultrasound; intravital imaging; monodisperse; nanodroplets; size control; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors' goal was to retrospectively analyze the sonication  strategies, adverse effects, and clinical and imaging outcomes in patients with  SDR ≤ 0.4 treated for tremor using MRgFUS. METHODS: Clinical outcomes and adverse  effects were assessed at 3 and 12 months after MRgFUS. Outcomes and lesion  location, volume, and shape characteristics (elongation and eccentricity) were  compared between the SDR groups. RESULTS: A total of 102 consecutive patients  were included in the analysis, of whom 39 had SDRs ≤ 0.4. No patient was excluded  from treatment because of an LSDR, with the lowest being 0.22. Lesioning  temperatures (> 52°C) and therapeutic ablations were achieved in all patients.  There were no significant differences in clinical outcome, adverse effects,  lesion location, and volume between the high SDR group and the LSDR group. SDR  was significantly associated with total energy (rho = -0.459, p < 0.001), heating  efficiency (rho = 0.605, p < 0.001), and peak temperature (rho = 0.222, p =  0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results show that treatment of tremor in  patients with an LSDR using MRgFUS is technically possible, leading to a safe and  lasting therapeutic effect. Limiting the number of sonications and adjusting the  energy and duration to achieve the required temperature early during the  treatment are suitable strategies in LSDR patients.","2024-03-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","639-647","","3","140","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37657095","","","","*Skull; *Tremor/diagnostic imaging/therapy; Head; Humans; MRgFUS; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Retrospective Studies; SDR; functional neurosurgery; magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound; skull density ratio; tremor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Uterine sarcomas, although rare, still represent  a diagnostic challenge and should be managed in centers with adequate expertise  in gynecological oncology. Objectives This article is aimed to summarize and  discuss cutting-edge elements about the diagnosis and management of uterine  fibroids and sarcomas. Methods This paper is a report of the lectures presented  in an expert meeting about uterine fibroids and sarcomas, held in Palermo in  February 2023. Outcome Overall, the combination of novel molecular pathways may  help to combine biomarkers and expert ultrasound for the differential diagnosis  of uterine fibroids and sarcomas. On the one hand, molecular, and cellular maps  of uterine fibroids and matched myometrium may enhance our understanding of tumor  development compared to histologic analysis and whole tissue transcriptomics and  support the development of minimally invasive treatment strategies; on the other  hand, ultrasound imaging allows in most of the cases a proper mapping the  fibroids and to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions, which needs  appropriate management. Conclusions and Outlook The choice of uterine fibroid  management, including pharmacological approaches, surgical treatment, or other  strategies such as High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU), should be carefully  considered taking into account the characteristics of the patient and  reproductive prognosis.","2024-02-21","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","Gynecol Obstet Invest","","","","","","","","eng","S.

One hurdle in the  development of these applications is safety. It may be possible to use safety  trends from seminal and subsequent works in focused ultrasound to guide the  development of safety guidelines for spinal cord applications. We collated data  from decades of pre-clinical studies and illustrate a clear relationship between  damage, time-averaged spatial peak intensity and exposure duration. This  relationship suggests a thermal mechanism underlies ultrasound-induced spinal  cord damage. We developed minimum and mean thresholds for damage from these  pre-clinical studies. When these thresholds were plotted against the parameters  used in recent pre-clinical ultrasonic spinal cord neuromodulation studies, the  majority of the neuromodulation studies were near or above the minimum threshold.  This suggests that a thermal neuromodulatory effect may exist for ultrasonic  spinal cord neuromodulation, and that the thermal dose must be carefully  controlled to avoid damage to the spinal cord. By contrast, the  intensity-exposure duration threshold had no predictive value when applied to  blood-spinal cord barrier opening studies that employed injected contrast agents.  Most blood-spinal cord barrier opening studies observed slight to severe damage,  except for small animal studies that employed an active feedback control method  to limit pressures based on measured bubble oscillation behavior. The development  of new focused ultrasound spinal cord applications perhaps reflects the recent  success in the development of focused ultrasound brain applications, and recent  work has begun on the translation of these technologies from brain to spinal  cord. However, a great deal of work remains to be done, particularly with respect  to developing and accepting safety standards for these applications.","2024-03","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","317-331","","3","50","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Crown Copyright © 2023.

Alcohol ablation was one of the initial methods used for the treatment  of liver lesions. It was surpassed by thermal ablation which has played a big  role in the therapeutic arsenal for primary and metastatic liver tumors. However,  thermal ablation has several shortcomings and limitations that prompted the  development of alternative technologies including electroporation and  histotripsy. Percutaneous alcohol injection in the liver lesion leads to  dehydration and coagulative necrosis. This technology is limited to the lesion  with relative sparing of the surrounding tissue, making it safe to use adjacent  to sensitive structures. Electroporation utilizes short high-voltage pulses to  permeabilize the cell membrane and can result in cell death dependent on the  threshold reached. It can effectively target the tumor margins and has lower  damage rates to surrounding structures due to the short pulse duration.  Histotripsy is a novel technology, and although the first human trial was just  completed, its results are encouraging, given the sharp demarcation of the  targeted tissue, lack of thermal damage, and potential for immunomodulation of  the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we discuss these techniques, their uses, and  overall clinical benefit.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","497-504","","6","40","","Semin Intervent Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","Thieme.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to report on the outcomes  between different tremor syndromes after a unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy.  METHODS: A total of 66 patients underwent a unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy for  tremor between November 2018 and May 2020 at St Vincent's Hospital Sydney. Each  patient's tremor syndrome was classified prior to treatment. Clinical  assessments, including the hand tremor score (HTS) and Quality of Life in  Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST), were performed at baseline and predefined  intervals to 36 months. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients, comprising 30 essential  tremor (ET), 24 dystonic tremor (DT), and 9 Parkinson's disease tremor (PDT)  patients, returned for at least one follow-up. In the ET patients, at 24 months  there was a 61% improvement in HTS and 50% improvement in QUEST compared to  baseline. This is in comparison to PDT patients, where an initial benefit in HTS  and QUEST was observed, which waned at each follow-up, remaining significant only  up until 12 months. In the DT patients, similar results were observed to the ET  patients: at 24 months there was a 61% improvement in HTS and 43% improvement in  QUEST compared to baseline. CONCLUSION: These results support the use of  unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy for the treatment of DT, which appears to have a  similar expected outcome to patients diagnosed with ET. Patients with PDT should  be warned that there is a risk of treatment failure. © 2023 The Authors.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided HIFU (EUS-HIFU) using  mechanical effects would have potential benefits, including precise detection of  target lesions and enhance drug delivery. The aim of this study is to develop  EUS-HIFU device and to prove our concept in porcine model using a locally  injected phase change nano droplet (PCND) as the sensitizer. METHOD: A  phospholipid PCND contained volatile perfluoro-carbon liquids. The prototype HIFU  apparatus comprised a small (20 × 20 mm) transducer with center frequency of  2.1 MHz, attachable to a linear EUS transducer. Under general anesthetic, a  single porcine received EUS-guided injection of PCND. The HIFU transducer was  placed laparotomically in the stomach, and the liver was ablated through the  gastric wall. RESULTS: PCND was injected successfully and a distinct lesion was  generated at the HIFU transducer focus only in injected areas that received HIFU  exposure at 4.7 kW/cm(2) at a duty cycle of 5 % (mean temporal intensity,  0.245 kW/cm(2)) for 30 s. The generated lesions were mechanically fractionated in  macroscopic view. CONCLUSION: The concept of transluminal HIFU ablation using  novel EUS-HIFU system was proved in a porcine animal model. This novel treatment  system has great potential for future cancer treatment although further  investigation in more animals and different organs are warranted.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","88-92","","1","24","","Pancreatology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 IAP and EPC.

Perera Molligoda","Revolutionizing cardiovascular care: the power of histotripsy.","Journal of ultrasound","","1876-7931","10.1007/s40477-023-00848-7","","Histotripsy, an innovative ultrasonic technique, is poised to transform the landscape of cardiovascular disease management. This review explores the  multifaceted applications of histotripsy across various domains of cardiovascular  medicine. In thrombolysis, histotripsy presents a non-invasive, drug-free, and  precise method for recanalizing blood vessels obstructed by clots, minimizing the  risk of vessel damage and embolism. Additionally, histotripsy showcases its  potential in congenital heart defect management, offering a promising alternative  to invasive procedures by creating intracardiac communications noninvasively. For  patients with calcified aortic stenosis, histotripsy demonstrates its  effectiveness in softening calcified bioprosthetic valves, potentially  revolutionizing valve interventions. In the realm of arrhythmias, histotripsy  could play an important role in scar-based ventricular tachycardia ablation,  eliminating channel-like isthmuses of slowly conducting myocardium. Histotripsy`s  potential applications also extend to structural heart interventions, enabling  the safe sectioning of basal chordae and potentially addressing mitral  regurgitation. Furthermore, it showcases its versatility by safely generating  ventricular septal defects, providing a non-invasive means of creating  intracardiac communications in neonates with congenital heart disease. Yet, most  supporting studies are in-vitro or animal studies and there are possible  challenges in translating experimental data on cardiac histotripsy to the  clinical level. As histotripsy continues to evolve and mature, its remarkable  potential in cardiovascular disease management holds promise for improving  patient outcomes and reducing the burden of invasive procedures in the field of  cardiology.","2024-01-13","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","J Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024.

In contrast to previously  available neurosurgical techniques, MRgFUS allows precise impact on deep brain  structures without the need for incision and yields an immediate effect. In its  high-intensity modality (MRgHIFU), it produces accurate therapeutic  thermoablation in previously selected brain targets. Importantly, the production  of the lesion is progressive and highly controlled in real-time by both  neuroimaging and clinical means. MRgHIFU ablation is already an accepted and  widely used treatment for medically-refractory Parkinson's disease and essential  tremor. Notably, other neurological disorders and diverse brain targets,  including bilateral treatments, are currently under examination. Conversely, the  low-intensity modality (MRgLIFU) shows promising prospects in neuromodulation and  transient blood-brain barrier opening (BBBO). In the former circumstance, MRgLIFU  could serve as a powerful clinical and research tool for non-invasively  modulating brain activity and function. BBBO, on the other hand, emerges as a  potentially impactful method to influence disease pathogenesis and progression by  increasing brain target engagement of putative therapeutic agents. While  promising, these applications remain experimental. As a recently developed  technology, MRgFUS is not without challenges and questions to be addressed.  Further developments and broader experience are necessary to enhance MRgFUS  capabilities in both research and clinical practice, as well as to define device  constraints. This clinical mini-review aims to provide an overview of the main  evidence of MRgFUS application and to highlight unmet needs and future  potentialities of the technique.","2024-02-12","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","106040","","","","","Parkinsonism Relat Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

A.","Technological innovations in shock wave lithotripsy.","Actas urologicas espanolas","","2173-5786","10.1016/j.acuroe.2023.09.001","","INTRODUCTION: Since 1980, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) has been employed in the treatment of urolithiasis, offering noninvasive alternatives to  surgical techniques. In addition to being limited by the size and location of the  stones, its efficacy is influenced by several factors. Despite the advancement of  other surgical techniques, SWL could maintain its position with new improvements.  Our objective is to review the existing literature on the latest advances in the  extracorporeal treatment of lithiasis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-systematic  literature review was carried out from 2017 to 2023 to obtain 26 articles on  three different emerging technologies in extracorporeal lithotripsy: Burst Wave  Lithotripsy (BWL), Histotripsy, and Microbubble Lithotripsy (ML). RESULTS: The  BWL uses sinusoidal bursts of US waves delivered at lower and higher frequencies  than conventional SWL. Its mechanism of action generates a higher quality  fragmentation (fine fragments) instead of generating tensile stresses for stone  fracture resulting in larger fragments, as in traditional SWL. Studies in pigs  and humans have shown effective fragmentation with a good safety profile. Based  on High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) technology, histotripsy fragments  tissue through cavitation. Good in vitro results have been shown, but the  formation of microbubbles between the stone and ultrasound waves hinders the  progress of this technique. Microbubble Lithotripsy (ML) combines microbubbles  and ultrasound for safe and effective stone fragmentation. In vitro and pig  results are promising. This technique can help optimize treatments and reduce  energy levels. CONCLUSIONS: Technological innovation is not only being applied to  endourological techniques, but also to ESWL. New techniques such as BWL,  histotripsy and ML are promising, with good results in the research phase.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","105-110","","1","48","","Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)","","","","","","","","spa","Copyright © 2023.

Each of these  techniques can effectively treat different neuropsychiatric disorders, but  treating any given disorder depends on choosing the right treatment target. Here,  we propose a three-phase framework for identifying and modulating these targets.  There are multiple approaches to identifying a target, including correlative  neuroimaging, retrospective optimization based on existing stimulation sites, and  lesion localization. These techniques can then be optimized using personalized  neuroimaging, physiological monitoring, and engagement of a specific brain state  using pharmacological or psychological interventions. Finally, a specific  stimulation modality or combination of modalities can be chosen after considering  the advantages and tradeoffs of each. While there is preliminary literature to  support different components of this framework, there are still many unanswered  questions. This presents an opportunity for the future growth of research and  clinical care in brain circuit therapeutics.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","179-188","","1","49","","Neuropsychopharmacology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.
