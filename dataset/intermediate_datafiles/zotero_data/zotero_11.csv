Histotripsy is a non-thermal, non-invasive  focused ultrasound therapy using controlled acoustic cavitation to mechanically  disintegrate tissue. Recent ex vivo and in vivo pilot studies have demonstrated  the ability of histotripsy for ablating OS but were limited in scope. This study  expands on these initial findings to more fully characterize the effects of  histotripsy for bone tumors, particularly in tumors with different compositions.  A prototype 500 kHz histotripsy system was used to treat ten dogs with suspected  OS at an intermediate treatment dose of 1000 pulses per location. One day after  histotripsy, treated tumors were resected via limb amputation, and radiologic and  histopathologic analyses were conducted to determine the effects of histotripsy  for each patient. The results of this study demonstrated that histotripsy  ablation is safe and feasible in canine patients with spontaneous OS, while  offering new insights into the characteristics of the achieved ablation zone.  More extensive tissue destruction was observed after histotripsy compared to that  in previous reports, and radiographic changes in tumor size and contrast uptake  following histotripsy were reported for the first time. Overall, this study  significantly expands our understanding of histotripsy bone tumor ablation and  informs future studies for this application.","2023-01-25","2024-03-18 17:30:09","2024-03-18T17:30:09Z","","","","3","15","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36765700  PMCID: PMC9913343","","","","ablation; bone tumors; canine; chondrosarcoma; focused ultrasound; histotripsy; osteosarcoma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, visualization of the NPV first  requires an injection of MRI contrast agents into the bloodstream, which has many  downsides. Purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning model capable of  predicting the NPV immediately after prostate ablation therapy without the need  for MRI contrast agents. A modified 2D deep learning UNet model was developed to  predict the post-treatment NPV. MRI imaging data from 95 patients who had  previously undergone prostate ablation therapy for treatment of localized  prostate cancer were used to train, validate, and test the model. Model inputs  were T1/T2-weighted and thermometry MRI images, which were always acquired  without any MRI contrast agents and prior to the final NPV image on  treatment-day. Model output was the predicted NPV. Model accuracy was assessed  using the Dice-Similarity Coefficient (DSC) by comparing the predicted to ground  truth NPV. A radiologist also performed a qualitative assessment of NPV. Mean  (std) DSC score for predicted NPV was 85% ± 8.1% compared to ground truth. Model  performance was significantly better for slices with larger prostate radii  (> 24 mm) and for whole-gland rather than partial ablation slices. The predicted  NPV was indistinguishable from ground truth for 31% of images. Feasibility of  predicting NPV using a UNet model without MRI contrast agents was clearly  established. If developed further, this could improve patient treatment outcomes  and could obviate the need for contrast agents altogether.

However, data  on its application and results are limited to small studies in varying countries  and hospitals. This United Kingdom (UK) national service evaluation study  assessed how combined LUS and FUSIC Heart were used in COVID-19 Intensive Care  Unit (ICU) patients during the first wave of the pandemic. METHOD: Twelve trusts  across the UK registered for this prospective study. LUS and FUSIC Heart data  were obtained, using a standardised data set including scoring of abnormalities,  between 1(st) February 2020 to 30th July 2020. The scans were performed by  intensivists with FUSIC Lung and Heart competency as a minimum standard. Data was  anonymised locally prior to transfer to a central database. RESULTS: 372 studies  were performed on 265 patients. There was a small but significant relationship  between LUS score >8 and 30-day mortality (OR 1.8). Progression of score was  associated with an increase in 30-day mortality (OR 1.2). 30-day mortality was  increased in patients with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (49.4% vs 29.2%).  Severity of LUS score correlated with RV dysfunction (p < 0.05). Change in  management occurred in 65% of patients following a combined scan. CONCLUSIONS: In  COVID-19 patients, there is an association between lung ultrasound score  severity, RV dysfunction and mortality identifiable by combined LUS and FUSIC  Heart. The use of 12-point LUS scanning resulted in similar risk score to 6-point  imaging in the majority of cases. Our findings suggest that serial combined LUS  and FUSIC Heart on COVID-19 ICU patients may aid in clinical decision making and  prognostication.","2023-05","2024-03-06 17:03:15","2024-03-06T17:03:15Z","","186-194","","2","24","","J Intensive Care Soc","","","","","","","","eng","© The Intensive Care Society 2022.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37255992  PMCID: PMC10225798","","","","ICU; Lung ultrasound; coronavirus; echocardiography; pandemic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Clinical data of  197 LSIL patients with HR-HPV infection between June 2009 and February 2022 were  collected. According to the treatment options chosen by the patients, they were  divided into the interferon, photodynamic therapy, follow-up observation, and  focused ultrasound (FUS) treatment groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)  and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the  influencing factors, including age, occupation, education level, maternity  history, reason for encounter, route of consultation, annual personal and  household income, screening for related risk factors, and identifying the best  benefit group of different treatment options. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA revealed a  statistically significant difference in age, education level, maternity history,  reason for encounter, and annual household income (p < 0.05). Multivariate  logistic regression analysis was performed on these five factors, indicating that  age ≤35 years, high school educational level or higher, and no childbirth history  were independent risk factors influencing patients' choices of FUS treatment.

Recent years showed significant  advancement in the field of CNS drug delivery enablers, with technologies such as  MR-guided focused ultrasound reaching clinical trials. This have inspired  researchers in the field to invent novel brain barriers opening (BBo)  technologies that are required to be simple, fast, safe and efficient. One such  technology, recently developed by us, is BDF (Barrier Disrupting Fields), based  on low pulsed electric fields (L-PEFs) for opening the BBB in a controlled, safe,  reversible and non-invasive manner. Here, we conducted an in vivo study to show  that BDF is a feasible technology for delivering Doxorubicin (Doxo) into mice  brain. Means for depicting BBBo levels were developed and applied for monitoring  the treatment and predicting response. Overall, the goals of the presented study  were to demonstrate the feasibility for delivering therapeutic Doxo doses into  naïve and tumor-bearing mice brains and applying delayed-contrast MRI (DCM) for  monitoring the levels of BBBo. METHODS: L-PEFs were applied using plate  electrodes placed on the intact skull of naïve mice. L-PEFs/Sham mice were  scanned immediately after the procedure by DCM (""MRI experiment""), or injected  with Doxo and Trypan blue followed by delayed (4 h) perfusion and brain  extraction (""Doxo experiment""). Doxo concentrations were measured in brain  samples using confocal microscopy and compared to IC(50) of Doxo in glioma cell  lines in vitro. In order to map BBBo extent throughout the brain, pixel by pixel  MR image analysis was performed using the DCM data. Finally, the efficacy of  L-PEFs in combination with Doxo was tested in nude mice bearing intracranial  human glioma tumors. RESULTS: Significant amount of Doxo was found in cortical  regions of all L-PEFs-treated mice brains (0.50 ± 0.06 µg Doxo/gr brain) while in  Sham brains, Doxo concentrations were below or on the verge of detection limit  (0.03 ± 0.02 µg Doxo/gr brain). This concentration was x97 higher than IC(50) of  Doxo calculated in gl261 mouse glioma cells and x8 higher than IC(50) of Doxo  calculated in U87 human glioma cells. DCM analysis revealed significant BBBo  levels in the cortical regions of L-PEFs-treated mice; the average volume of BBBo  in the L-PEFs-treated mice was x29 higher than in the Sham group. The calculated  BBBo levels dropped exponentially as a function of BBBo threshold, similarly to  the electric fields distribution in the brain. Finally, combining non-invasive  L-PEFs with Doxo significantly decreased brain tumors growth rates in nude mice.  CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate significant BBBo levels induced by  extra-cranial L-PEFs, enabling efficient delivery of therapeutic Doxo doses into  the brain and reducing tumor growth. As BBBo was undetectable by standard  contrast-enhanced MRI, DCM was applied to generate maps depicting the BBBo levels  throughout the brain. These findings suggest that BDF is a promising technology  for efficient drug delivery into the brain with important implications for future  treatment of brain cancer and additional CNS diseases.","2023-09-22","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","67","","1","20","","Fluids Barriers CNS","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

These brain regions include the ventromedial prefrontal cortex  (vmPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), amygdala, insular cortex, and  hippocampus. Psychiatric neuroimaging research shows that functional  dysregulation of these brain regions might contribute to the etiology and  symptomatology of various psychopathologies, including anxiety disorders and post  traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Barad et al. Biol Psychiatry 60:322-328, 2006;  Greco and Liberzon Neuropsychopharmacology 41:320-334, 2015; Milad et al. Biol  Psychiatry 62:1191-1194, 2007a, Biol Psychiatry 62:446-454, b; Maren and Quirk  Nat Rev Neurosci 5:844-852, 2004; Milad and Quirk Annu Rev Psychol 63:129, 2012;  Phelps et al. Neuron 43:897-905, 2004; Shin and Liberzon Neuropsychopharmacology  35:169-191, 2009). Combined, these findings indicate that targeting the  activation of these nodes and modulating their functional interactions might  offer an opportunity to further our understanding of how fear and threat  responses are formed and regulated in the human brain, which could lead to  enhancing the efficacy of current treatments or creating novel treatments for  PTSD and other psychiatric disorders (Marin et al. Depress Anxiety 31:269-278,  2014; Milad et al. Behav Res Ther 62:17-23, 2014). Device-based neuromodulation  techniques provide a promising means for directly changing or regulating activity  in the fear extinction network by targeting functionally connected brain regions  via stimulation patterns (Raij et al. Biol Psychiatry 84:129-137, 2018; Marković  et al. Front Hum Neurosci 15:138, 2021). In the past ten years, notable  advancements in the precision, safety, comfort, accessibility, and control of  administration have been made to the established device-based neuromodulation  techniques to improve their efficacy. In this chapter we discuss ten years of  progress surrounding device-based neuromodulation techniques-Electroconvulsive  Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Magnetic Seizure Therapy  (MST), Transcranial Focused Ultrasound (TUS), Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), Vagus  Nerve Stimulation (VNS), and Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES)-as  research and clinical tools for enhancing fear extinction and treating PTSD  symptoms. Additionally, we consider the emerging research, current limitations,  and possible future directions for these techniques.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","353-387","","","64","","Curr Top Behav Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Data is however conflicting, and there are several advantages  when the subclavian route is used for tCDCs. This prospective, controlled,  randomised, non-inferiority study aims to compare the incidence of  post-catheterisation central vein stenosis between the right subclavian and the  right internal jugular routes. METHODS: Adult patients needing a tCDC will be  included from several hospitals and randomised to either subclavian or internal  jugular vein catheterisation with a silicone tCDC. Inclusion continues until 50  patients in each group have undergone a follow-up CT venography. The primary  outcome is the incidence of post-catheterisation central vein stenosis detected  by a CT venography performed 1.5 to 3 months after removal of the tCDC. Secondary  outcomes include between-group comparisons of (I) the patients' experience of  discomfort and pain, (II) any dysfunction of the tCDC during use, (III)  catheterisation success rate and (IV) the number of mechanical complications.  Furthermore, the ability to detect central vein stenosis by a focused ultrasound  examination will be evaluated using the CT venography as golden standard.  DISCUSSION: The use of the subclavian route for tCDC placement has largely been  abandoned due to older studies with various methodological issues. However, the  subclavian route offers several advantages for the patient. This trial is  designed to provide robust data on the incidence of central vein stenosis after  silicone tCDC insertion in the era of ultrasound-guided catheterisations.

BCR increases  the risk of distant metastasis and mortality in patients with prognostically  unfavorable features. These patients are best managed with a tailored treatment  strategy incorporating risk stratification using clinicopathological factors,  next-generation imaging, and genomic testing. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review  examines the utility of risk stratification for the management of patients with  BCR in the context of clinical trial data, referencing the latest recommendations  by European and US medical societies. METHODS: PubMed was searched for relevant  studies published through May 21 2023 on treatment of patients with BCR after  radical prostatectomy (RP) or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). RESULTS:  European and US guidelines support the risk-stratified management of BCR.  Post-RP, salvage EBRT (with or without androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]) is an  accepted treatment option for patients with BCR. Post-EBRT, local salvage  therapies (RP, cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound, stereotactic body  radiotherapy, and low-dose-rate and high-dose-rate brachytherapy) have  demonstrated comparable relapse-free survival rates but differing adverse event  profiles, short and long term. Local salvage therapies should be used for  local-only relapses while ADT should be considered for regional or distant  relapses. In practice, patients often receive ADT, with varying guidance for  intermittent ADT vs. continuous ADT, due to consideration of quality-of-life  effects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lack of consensus for BCR treatment among  guideline associations and medical societies, risk stratification of patients is  essential for personalized treatment approaches, as it allows for an informed  selection of therapeutic strategies and estimation of adverse events. In  lower-risk disease, observation is recommended while in higher-risk disease,  after failed repeat local therapy, ADT and/or clinical trial enrollment may be  appropriate. Results from ongoing clinical studies of patients with BCR should  provide consensus for management.","2023-09-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

However, reports on bilateral Vim  thalamotomy for ET remain scarce. METHODS: To review the results and  complications of bilateral Vim thalamotomy for the treatment of ET in the upper  extremities, we retrospectively analyzed the patients with ET who underwent  bilateral Vim thalamotomy with radiofrequency (RF) thermal coagulation. As  bilateral simultaneous thalamotomy can cause surgical complications, thalamotomy  was performed in stages. The interval between the first and second thalamotomies  was 21.3 ± 14.7 months. We evaluated the efficacy using the Clinical Rating Scale  for Tremor (CRST) before and after the first and second treatments, respectively.  We also evaluated the complications before and after the first and second  treatments, respectively. Moreover, we assessed the adverse events. RESULTS:  Seventeen patients were included in the study. The mean follow-up period  following the second thalamotomy was 29.3 ± 15.0 months. The CRST part A + B  scores were 34.9 ± 9.7, 20.8 ± 7.0, and 7.4 ± 6.8 before, following the first  (40.4% improvement, p < 0.0001) and second thalamotomies (78.6% improvement, p <  0.0001), respectively. Nine patients presented with prolonged adverse events,  including dysarthria, dysgeusia, dysphagia, tongue numbness, unsteady gait, and  postural instability at the last available evaluation. All adverse events were  mild and did not interfere with the patient's daily activities.  DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral Vim thalamotomy with RF thermal coagulation was  an effective treatment for ET in both upper extremities. Despite most possible  complications being mild, additional studies with a larger sample size are  required to ensure patient safety.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","30-40","","1","101","","Stereotact Funct Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 S.

The feasibility, safety,  and efficacy of sonobiopsy were demonstrated in both small and large animal  models using magnetic resonance-guided FUS devices. However, the high cost and  complex operation of magnetic resonance-guided FUS devices limit the future broad  application of sonobiopsy in the clinic. In this study, a neuronavigation-guided  sonobiopsy device is developed and its targeting accuracy is characterized in  vitro, in vivo, and in silico. The sonobiopsy device integrated a commercially  available neuronavigation system (BrainSight) with a nimble, lightweight FUS  transducer. Its targeting accuracy was characterized in vitro in a water tank  using a hydrophone. The performance of the device in BBB disruption was verified  in vivo using a pig model, and the targeting accuracy was quantified by measuring  the offset between the target and the actual locations of BBB opening. The  feasibility of the FUS device in targeting glioblastoma (GBM) tumors was  evaluated in silico using numerical simulation by the k-Wave toolbox in  glioblastoma patients. It was found that the targeting accuracy of the  neuronavigation-guided sonobiopsy device was 1.7 ± 0.8 mm as measured in the  water tank. The neuronavigation-guided FUS device successfully induced BBB  disruption in pigs with a targeting accuracy of 3.3 ± 1.4 mm. The targeting  accuracy of the FUS transducer at the GBM tumor was 5.5 ± 4.9 mm. Age, sex, and  incident locations were found to be not correlated with the targeting accuracy in  GBM patients. This study demonstrated that the developed neuronavigation-guided  FUS device could target the brain with a high spatial targeting accuracy, paving  the foundation for its application in the clinic.","2023-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1528-1538","","5","70","","IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36374883  PMCID: PMC10176741","","","","*Brain Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Glioblastoma; Animals; Blood-Brain Barrier/diagnostic imaging; Brain; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Microbubbles; Neuronavigation/methods; Swine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similar to focused ultrasound, FSW deliver  highly precise stimulation of discrete brain regions with adjustable focal  lengths that essentially covers the whole brain. By opening the BCSFB, it allows  for rapid widespread drug delivery to the whole brain by cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF) circulation. Although no definite adverse effect or permeant injury was  noted in our previous study, microscopic hemorrhage was infrequently observed.  Safety concerns remain the major obstacle to further application of FSW in brain.  To enhance its applicability, a modified single pulse FSW technique was  established that present 100% opening rate but much less risk of adverse effect  than previous methods. By moving the targeting area 2.5 mm more superficially on  the left lateral ventricle as compared with the previous methods, the microscopic  hemorrhage rate was reduced to zero. We systemically examine the safety profiles  of the modified FSW-BCSFB opening regarding abnormal behavior and brain injury or  hemorrhage 72 hr after 0, 1, and 10 pulses of FSW-treatment. Animal behavior,  physiological monitor, and brain MRI were examined and recorded. Brain section  histology was examined for hemorrhage, apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress  related immunohistochemistry and biomarkers. The single pulse FSW group  demonstrated no mortality or gross/microscopic hemorrhage (N = 30), and no  observable changes in all examined outcomes, while 10 pulses of FSW was found to  be associated with microscopic and temporary RBC extravasation (N = 6/30), and  abnormal immunohistochemistry biomarkers which showed a trend of recovery at  72 hrs. The results suggest that single pulse low-energy FSW-BCSFB opening is  effective, safe and poses minimal risk of injury to brain tissue (Sprague Dawley,  SD rats).","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","97-107","","1","30","","Drug Deliv","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36533878  PMCID: PMC9769131","","","","*Blood-Brain Barrier; *Microbubbles; Animals; Brain; CSF circulation; Drug Delivery Systems/methods; Hemorrhage/pathology; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Safety; blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier; brain; shockwave","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, repeated use of  gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) presents safety concerns to patients.  This study is the first to propose the idea of modeling a volume transfer  constant (Ktrans) through deep learning to reduce the dosage of contrast agents.  The goal of the study is not only to reconstruct artificial intelligence (AI)  derived Ktrans images but to also enhance the intensity with low dosage contrast  agent T1 weighted MRI scans. We successfully validated this idea through a  previous state-of-the-art temporal network algorithm, which focused on extracting  time domain features at the voxel level. Then we used a Spatiotemporal Network  (ST-Net), composed of a spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (CNN)-based  deep learning architecture with the addition of a three-dimensional CNN encoder,  to improve the model performance. We tested the ST-Net model on ten datasets of  FUS-induced BBB-openings aquired from different sides of the mouse brain. ST-Net  successfully detected and enhanced BBB-opening signals without sacrificing  spatial domain information.

According to the American Institute of  Ultrasound in Medicine, more than a third of all US medical schools have adopted  a focused ultrasound training program for medical students. Medical student  perspectives on best practices in ultrasound education are lacking in the  literature. CURRICULA EXPERIENCES: Two students' reflections are presented  regarding two different didactic approaches, flipped classroom and self-study  learning models, to teaching ultrasound in the pre-clinical medical education  curriculum. Students present reflections on these didactic approaches to  facilitate further improvement in ultrasound education curricula. DISCUSSION: The  self-directed learning model enabled students to learn foundational ultrasound  exam techniques efficiently in a low-stress environment and subsequently  optimized the efficiency of later faculty-led learning events. However, we noted  that in both the flipped classroom and self-study learning models of education,  the training on basic physical properties of ultrasound, tissue characteristics,  and probe manipulation was limited. CONCLUSION: A self-study learning model  ultrasound curricula improves perceived learning efficiency and student  confidence, especially when followed by faculty-guided didactics and scanning  opportunities. We suggest a framework for ultrasound education curricula that  includes components of both formats of ultrasound education alongside faculty-led  sessions as an ideal model of ultrasound education. Further, we propose the added  benefit of inanimate object scanning to optimize students' knowledge of waveform  physics (image acquisition and physical properties of materials) early in the  ultrasound education process.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1-7","","","14","","Adv Med Educ Pract","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Allen et al.","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 36632196  PMCID: PMC9827631","","","","education; medical; ultrasonography; ultrasonography education; ultrasound; undergraduate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With advances in medical technology, women are  increasingly interested in treatments that avoid surgery and/or preserve the  uterus, which has undoubtedly contributed to the development of minimally  invasive approaches. This article reviews the literature and evaluates the  effectiveness and safety of minimally invasive approaches for the treatment of  leiomyomas and describes the current state of development of minimally invasive  treatment modalities for leiomyomas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Web of Science and  PubMed were systematically evaluated using the following keywords: uterine artery  embolization, high-intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation,  radiofrequency ablation, myomectomy, hysterectomy, leiomyomas, fertility. English  abstracts relevant to the topic were selected and full-text articles were  carefully analyzed. RESULTS: Uterine artery embolization is an effective  treatment modality that has been widely validated, and the remaining means each  have their distinct advantages in clinical practice, but more practical and  comparative studies are needed. Minimally invasive myomectomy and minimally  invasive hysterectomy are technically advanced compared to classical open surgery  and are widely used due to the completion of practical experience, but a  continuous interest in non-invasive minimally invasive treatment modalities is  retained.

The BBB plays a  crucial role in maintaining CNS physiological function and brain homeostasis. It  can protect the CNS from the entrance of toxic and infectious agents, however, it  also restricts the drug permeation into brain to play a therapeutic role. The BBB  has been the biggest limiting hurdle to medications entering the brain excluding  from the brain about 100% of large-molecule and more than 98% of all  small-molecule neurotherapeutics. As a result, it is of inability for drug  molecule to reach requisite concentrations within the brain. OBJECTIVE: With the  aim of enhancing drug permeability and efficacy, a variety of strategies have  been developed: invasive approaches, such as intraarterial delivery, intrathecal  delivery, or administrating directly the drug intraventricularly and  intracerebrally; non-invasive approaches that take advantage of innate BBB  functions, using prodrugs, focused ultrasound, intranasal administration or  nanotechnology. CONCLUSIONS: Here we mainly review recent developments and  challenges related to non-invasive BBB-crossing techniques, whose benefits  include higher efficacy, easier application, less treatment burden, better  patient acceptability, and adherence. Additionally, we also analyze the potential  of non-invasive methods in the treatment of CNS disorders and render them as a  most suitable platform for the management of neurological diseases.","2023-12-21","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","25","","1","51","","Mol Biol Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Unintended off-target neuronal excitation can be elicited when  the beam focusing accuracy and resolution are limited, whereas the resulted side  effect has not been evaluated quantitatively. There is also a lack of methods  addressing the minimization of such side effects. Therefore, this work introduces  a computational model of unintended neuronal excitation during LIFU  neuromodulation, which evaluates the off-target activation area (OTAA) by  integrating an ultrasound field model with the neuronal spiking model. In  addition, a phased array beam focusing scheme called constrained optimal  resolution beamforming (CORB) is proposed to minimize the off-target neuronal  excitation area while ensuring effective stimulation in the target brain region.  A lower bound of the OTAA is analytically approximated in a simplified  homogeneous medium, which could guide the selection of transducer parameters such  as aperture size and operating frequency. Simulations in a human head model using  three transducer setups show that CORB markedly reduces the OTAA compared with  two benchmark beam focusing methods. The high neuromodulation resolution  demonstrates the capability of LIFU to effectively limit the side effects during  neuromodulation, allowing future clinical applications such as treatment of  neuropsychiatric disorders.","2023-08-17","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","13403","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

In this study, we demonstrate for the first time  the application of a single-element biaxially driven ring transducerin vivofor  blood-brain barrier opening in mice, and compare it to that achieved with a  conventional single-element highly focused (F# = 0.7) spherical transducer  operating at a similar frequency. Transcranial focused ultrasound (0.45 MPa, 10  ms pulse length, 1 Hz repetition frequency, 30 s duration) was applied  bilaterally to mice with a 40μl/kg bolus of Definity(TM)microbubbles, employing  either a single-element biaxial ring (1.482 MHz, 10 mm inner diameter, 13.75 mm  outer diameter) or spherical (1.5 MHz, 35 mm diameter, F# = 0.7; RK50, FUS  Instruments) transducer on each side. Follow-up MRI scans (T1 pre- and post- 0.2  mmol/kg Gd injection, T2) were acquired to assess blood-brain barrier opening  volume and potential damage. Compared to blood-brain barrier opening achieved  with a conventional single-element spherical focused transducer, the opening  volume achieved with a single-element biaxial ring transducer was 35% smaller (p=  0.002) with a device of a ring diameter of 40% the aperture size. Axial  refocusing was further demonstrated with the single-element biaxial ring  transducer, yielding a 1.63 mm deeper, five-fold larger opening volume (p= 0.048)  relative to its small-focus mode. The biaxial ring transducer achieved a more  localized opening compared to the spherical focused transducer under the same  parameters, and further enabled dynamic axial refocusing with a single-element  transducer with a smaller fabrication footprint.","2023-09-19","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","19","68","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Creative Commons Attribution license.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37607563","","","","*Acoustics; *Blood-Brain Barrier/diagnostic imaging; Animals; Electricity; Heart Rate; Mice; Microbubbles; biaxial transducer; blood-brain barrier; magnetic resonance imaging; microbubble; transcranial focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the safety and biological consequences of  BBB opening remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the effects  of varying microbubble volume doses (MVD) and ultrasound mechanical indices (MI)  on BBB opening and the sterile inflammatory response (SIR) using high-resolution  ultra-high field MRI-guided FUS in mouse brains. The results demonstrate that  both MVD and MI significantly influence the extent of BBB opening, with higher  doses and mechanical indices leading to increased permeability. Moreover, RNA  sequencing reveals upregulated inflammatory pathways and immune cell infiltration  after BBB opening, suggesting the presence and extent of SIR. Gene set enrichment  analysis identifies 12 gene sets associated with inflammatory responses that are  upregulated at higher doses of MVD or MI. A therapeutic window is established  between significant BBB opening and the onset of SIR, providing operating regimes  for avoiding each three classes of increasing damage from stimulation of the NFκB  pathway via TNFL signaling to apoptosis. This study contributes to the  optimization and standardization of BBB opening parameters for safe and effective  drug delivery to the brain and sheds light on the underlying molecular mechanisms  of the sterile inflammatory response. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The significance of  this study lies in its comprehensive investigation of microbubble-facilitated  focused ultrasound for blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening. By systematically  exploring various combinations of microbubble volume doses and ultrasound  mechanical indices, the study reveals their direct impact on the extent of BBB  permeability and the induction of sterile inflammatory response (SIR). The  establishment of a therapeutic window between significant BBB opening and the  onset of SIR provides critical insights for safe and targeted drug delivery to  the brain. These findings advance our understanding of the biological  consequences of BBB opening and contribute to optimizing parameters for clinical  applications, thus minimizing potential health risks, and maximizing the  therapeutic potential of this technique.","2023-10-25","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: bioRxiv Pages: 2023.10.23.563613 Publication Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology PMID: 37961395  PMCID: PMC10634745","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Develop a dense algorithm for calculating the speed-of-sound shift between consecutive acoustic acquisitions as a noninvasive means to evaluating  temperature change during thermal ablation.Methods. An algorithm for dense  speed-of-sound shift imaging (DSI) was developed to simultaneously incorporate  information from the entire field of view using a combination of dense optical  flow and inverse problem regularization, thus speeding up the calculation and  introducing spatial agreement between pixels natively. Thermal ablation  monitoring consisted of two main steps: pixel shift tracking using Farneback  optical flow, and mathematical modeling of the relationship between the pixel  displacement and temperature change as an inverse problem to find the  speed-of-sound shift. A calibration constant translates from speed-of-sound shift  to temperature change. The method performance was tested inex vivosamples and  compared to standard thermal strain imaging (TSI) methods.Main results. Thermal  ablation at a frequency of 2 MHz was applied to an agarose phantom that created a  speed-of-sound shift measured by an L12-5 imaging transducer. A focal spot was  reconstructed by solving the inverse problem. Next, a thermocouple measured the  temperature rise during thermal ablation ofex vivochicken breast to calibrate the  setup. Temperature changes between 3 °C and 15 °C was measured with high  thermometry precision of less than 2 °C error for temperature changes as low as 8  °C. The DSI method outperformed standard TSI in both spatial coherence and  runtime in high-intensity focused ultrasound-induced hyperthermia.Significance.  Dense ultrasonic speed-of-sound shift imaging can successfully monitor the  speed-of-sound shift introduced by thermal ablation. This technique is faster and  more robust than current methods, and therefore can be used as a noninvasive,  real time and cost-effective thermometry method, with high clinical  applicability.","2023-10-19","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","21","68","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Creative Commons Attribution license.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37774710","","","","*Hyperthermia, Induced/methods; *Thermometry/methods; Body Temperature; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Phantoms, Imaging; Temperature; Ultrasonics; focused ultrasound; hyperthermia; speed of sound shift imaging; thermal ablation; ultrasound imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to  measure the effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and sonodynamic therapy (SDT),  which are currently being used to treat brain tumors, as well as  sono-photodynamic therapy (SPDT), which is the combination of these two.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with C6  glioma cells in a cortical region and treated with PDT, SDT, and SPDT. Gd-MRI was  monitored weekly and 18F-FDG-PET the day before and 1 week after the treatment.  The acoustic power used during sonication was 5.5 W/cm² using a 0.5-MHz  single-element transducer. The 633-nm laser was illuminated at 100 J/cm².  Oxidative stress and apoptosis markers were evaluated 3 days after treatment  using immunohistochemistry (IHC): 4-HNE, 8-OhdG, and Caspase-3. RESULTS: A  decrease in tumor volume was observed in MRI imaging 12 days after the treatment  in the PDT group (p<0.05), but the SDT group showed a slight increase compared to  the 5-Ala group. The high expression rates of reactive oxygen species-related  factors, such as 8-OhdG (p<0.001) and Caspase-3 (p<0.001), were observed in the  SPDT group compared to other groups in IHC. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that  light with sensitizers can inhibit GBM growth, but not ultrasound. Although SPDT  did not show the combined effect in MRI, high oxidative stress was observed in  IHC. Further studies are needed to investigate the safety parameters to apply  ultrasound in GBM.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","233-242","","4","64","","Yonsei Med J","","","","","","","","eng","© Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2023.","","","","","","Place: Korea (South) PMID: 36996894  PMCID: PMC10067799","","","","*Brain Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy; *Glioblastoma/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy; *Glioma/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy; *Photochemotherapy/methods; *Ultrasonic Therapy/methods; Animals; Caspase 3; Cell Line, Tumor; Focused ultrasound; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; glioblastoma; photodynamic therapy; sono-photodynamic therapy; sonodynamic therapy; treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach can be monitored through analysis of the received  signal to distinguish between stable cavitation associated with safe BBB opening  and inertial cavitation associated with blood vessel damage. In this study, FUS  phantom and animal studies were used to evaluate the experimental conditions that  generate several cross-consistent metrics having the potential to be combined for  the reliable, automatic control of cavitation levels. METHODS: Typical metrics  for cavitation monitoring involve observing changes in the spectrum generated by  applying the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to the time domain signal detected  using a hydrophone during FUS. A confocal hydrophone was used to capture  emissions during a 10 ms FUS burst, sampled at 32 ns intervals, to produce  321,500 points and a high-resolution spectrum when transformed. The FUS spectra  were analyzed to show the impact that equipment-transients and well-known  DFT-related distortions had on the metrics used for cavitation control. A new  approach, physical sparsification (PH-SP), was introduced to sharpen FUS spectral  peaks and minimize the effect of these distortions. DISCUSSION: It was  demonstrated that the general spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) could be  improved by removing the initial noisy phantom hydrophone signal transient. Minor  changes in the transient length digitally removed from the sampled values  significantly changed the spectral bandwidths of all the harmonically related FUS  signals. We evaluated signal processing techniques to minimize the impact these  DFT-related distortions on area-under-the-curve (AUC) metric calculations, and we  identified the advantages of using PH-SP and proposed new metrics when  characterizing FUS spectral properties. The results show many second, third and  sub-harmonic metrics provide cross-consistent evidence of changes between stable  and inertial cavitation levels. Removing the first harmonic signal component with  a hardware low-pass filter allowed the hydrophone gain to be boosted without  introducing distortion, leading to an improved analysis of the sub-harmonic  signal orders of magnitude smaller in intensity. Metrics that optimized the  energy in the real component of the complex-valued PH-SP spectra provided a 32%  increase in the sub-harmonic sensitivity compared to standard metrics.  CONCLUSION: A preliminary investigation of existing and proposed metrics showed  that system noise could be large enough to mask the transition between stable and  inertial cavitation. Strong narrowing of sub-harmonic peak shapes on applying  physical sparsification (PH-SP) were seen in both phantom and animal studies.  However, validating equivalent trends of the metrics with pressure were limited  by the increased system noise level in the animal study combined with the natural  variability between subjects studied. The combined use of hardware low-pass  filters and physical sparsification to selectively removing distortions in the  spectrum allowed the optimization of metrics for cavitation monitoring by  improving the sub-harmonic sensitivity.","2023-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1118-1128","","5","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

SDR values vary across the skull and the  mean value is known to be predictive of sonication thermal increase. The aim of  this investigation was to explore the effects of the SDR distribution on clinical  outcomes following treatment with MRgFUS. METHODS: Data from 61 patients with  essential or dystonic tremor treated with MRgFUS targeting the ventral  intermediate nucleus (Vim) were retrospectively analyzed. Tremor suppression was  assessed using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) and hand tremor score  (HTS). Vim ablation volume was measured on the T1-weighted MR image acquired both  at 1 day and 12 months after treatment. The numerical distribution of SDR values  measured for each element in the ultrasound transducer was quantified by  calculating the mean, standard deviation, skewness, entropy, and kurtosis of the  SDR histogram. The effect of the SDR metrics on change in CRST and HTS was  examined using a linear mixed-effects model. Additionally, the effect of the  regional distribution of SDR values was explored in an element-wise analysis  between patients with above- and below-average tremor suppression. RESULTS: A  significant positive effect was found between SDR kurtosis and improvement in  CRST (β = 0.33, p = 0.004) and HTS (β = 0.38, p < 0.001). The effect was found to  be significant at 1 month posttreatment (CRST: β = 0.415, p = 0.008; HTS: β =  0.369, p = 0.016), and at the most recent clinical follow-up (CRST: β = 0.395, p  < 0.001; HTS: β = 0.386, p < 0.001). One hundred seventy-one significant elements  were identified in the element-wise analysis. The mean percentage difference from  the mean SDR in these elements was associated with improvement in CRST (β = 0.27,  p < 0.008) and HTS (β = 0.27, p < 0.015). Higher SDR kurtosis was associated with  increased lesion volume at 12 months (p = 0.040) and less reduction in volume  relative to the day-1 lesion volume (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Greater SDR  kurtosis was associated with larger, more stable lesions at 12 months  posttreatment and increased tremor suppression at long-term follow-up. SDR  kurtosis may provide a more meaningful prognostic factor than the mean SDR.","2024-03-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","648-656","","3","140","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37657096","","","","*Head; *Tremor/diagnostic imaging/therapy; Humans; MRgFUS; Retrospective Studies; Skull; Ultrasonography; dystonic tremor; essential tremor; focused ultrasound; functional neurosurgery; skull density ratio; thalamotomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Our study comprised 59 patients who answered  questions about the pain they experienced during unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy.  The location and features of pain were investigated using a questionnaire  including the numerical rating scale (NRS) to estimate maximum pain intensity and  the Japanese version of the Short Form of McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 to evaluate  the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of pain. Several clinical factors  were investigated for possible correlation with pain intensity. RESULTS:  Forty-eight patients (81%) reported sonication-related head pain, and the degree  of pain was severe (NRS score ≥ 7) in 39 patients (66%). The distribution of  sonication-related pain was ""localized"" in 29 (49%) and ""diffuse"" in 16 (27%);  the most frequent location was the ""occipital"" region. The pain features most  frequently reported were those in the ""affective"" subscale of the Short Form of  McGill Pain Questionnaire 2. Patients with diffuse pain had a higher NRS score  and lower skull density ratio than did patients with localized pain. The NRS  score negatively correlated with tremor improvement at 6 months post-treatment.  CONCLUSION: Most patients in our cohort experienced pain during MRgFUS. The  distribution and intensity of pain varied according to the skull density ratio,  indicating that the pain might have had different origins.

This study aimed to  minimize confounders associated with medial thalamotomy for treating chronic pain  by using modern MRI-guided stereotactic lesioning and a rigorous clinical design.  METHODS: This prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial in 10  patients with trigeminal neuropathic pain used sham procedures as controls.  Participants underwent assessments by a pain psychologist and pain management  clinician, including use of the following measures: the Numeric Pain Rating Scale  (NPRS); patient-reported outcome measures; and patient's impression of  improvement at baseline, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postprocedure.  Patients in the treated group underwent bilateral focused ultrasound (FUS) medial  thalamotomy targeting the central lateral nucleus. Patients in the control group  underwent sham procedures with energy output disabled. The primary efficacy  outcome measure was between-group differences in pain intensity (using the NPRS)  at baseline and at 3 months postprocedure. Adverse events were measured for  safety and included MRI analysis. Exploratory measures of connectivity and  metabolism were analyzed using diffusion tensor imaging, functional MRI, and PET,  respectively. RESULTS: There were no serious complications from the FUS  procedures. MRI confirmed bilateral medial thalamic ablations. There was no  significant improvement in pain intensity from baseline to 3 months, either for  patients undergoing FUS medial thalamotomy or for sham controls; and the  between-group change in NPRS score as the primary efficacy outcome measure was  not significantly different. Patient-reported outcome assessments demonstrated  improvement (i.e., a decrease) only in pain interference with enjoyment of life  at 3 months. There was a perception of benefit at 1 week, but only for patients  treated with FUS and not for the sham cohort. Advanced neuroimaging showed that  these medial thalamic lesions altered structural connectivity with the  postcentral gyrus and demonstrated a trend toward hypometabolism in the insula  and amygdala.

The DC imaging method has primarily been investigated in  simulation and in phantom studies. This work investigates the feasibility of the  DC method in monitoring thermal therapy via image guidance and non-invasive  thermometry based on the change in backscattered energy (CBE). METHODS: Ex vivo  porcine tissue was exposed to FUS exposures at acoustic powers of 5 W and 1 W,  with peak pressure amplitudes of 0.64 MPa and 0.27 MPa respectively. During FUS  exposure, RF echo data frames was acquired using a 7.8 MHz linear array probe and  a Verasonics Vantage(TM) ultrasound scanner (Verasonics Inc., Redmond, WA). RF  echo data was taken to produce B-mode images, as reference images. Synthetic  aperture RF echo data was also acquired and processed using delay-and-sum (DAS),  a combination of spatial and frequency compounding referred to as Traditional  Compounding (TC), and the proposed DC imaging methods. Image quality was assessed  using the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) at the FUS beam focus, and the speckle  SNR (sSNR) of the background region as preliminary metrics. A calibrated  thermocouple was placed near the FUS beam focus for temperature measurements and  calibrations using the CBE method. RESULTS: The DC imaging method significantly  improved image quality to detect low contrast thermal lesions in treated ex vivo  porcine tissue in comparison to other imaging methods. In comparison to B-mode  imaging, the lesion CNR measured using the DC imaging was shown to improve up to  a factor of approximately 5.5. The corresponding sSNR improved by a factor of  approximately 4.2 in comparison to B-mode imaging. CBE calculation using the DC  imaging method yielded more precise measurements of the backscattered energy  compared to other imaging methods studied. CONCLUSIONS: The despeckling  performance of the DC imaging method significantly improves the lesion CNR in  comparison to B-mode imaging. This suggests that the proposed method can detect  low-contrast thermal lesions induced by FUS therapy that are not detectable using  standard B-mode imaging. Furthermore, the signal change at the focal point were  more precisely measured by DC imaging, and the signal change in response to FUS  exposure follows the temperature profile more closely than changes measured using  B-mode, as well as synthetic aperture DAS and TC images. These suggest that DC  imaging can potentially be used with the CBE method to improve non-invasive  thermometry.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","107098","","","134","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023.

METHODS:  This study was nested in the FU arm of a prospective cohort study. A total of 37  patients diagnosed with HR-HPV infection-related cervical low-grade squamous  intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in  this study from October 2020 to November 2021, and these patients were treated  with FU. We used 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing to profile  the vaginal microbiota composition of patients before and 3 months after FU  treatment. RESULTS: After FU treatment, HR-HPV was cleared in 24 patients, with a  clearance rate of 75.0% (24/32). Lactobacillus iners was the predominant species  among all samples. No significant difference was found in alpha-diversity index  before and 3 months after FU treatment (P > 0.05), but the rarefaction curves  showed that the vaginal microbial diversity before FU treatment was higher than  that after FU treatment. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe)  showed that Bifidobacterium contributed the most to the difference between the  two groups at the genus level, and the abundance after FU treatment was  significantly higher than that before treatment (P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The  decrease of vaginal microbial diversity may be related to the clearance of HR-HPV  infection, and FU treatment contributed to the decrease of vaginal microbial  diversity. Increased Bifidobacterium abundance in the vaginal microbiome may be  associated with clearance of HR-HPV infection, and FU treatment may contribute to  the increase in Bifidobacterium abundance.

The authors sought to  evaluate the technical feasibility and utility of intraprocedural  diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the prediction of final lesion size and  location. METHODS: Lesion diameter and distance from the midline were measured on  both intraprocedural and immediate postprocedural diffusion and T2-weighted  sequences. Bland-Altman analysis was utilized to determine differences in  measurement between intraprocedural and immediate postprocedural images with both  sequences. RESULTS: Lesion size increased on both the postprocedural diffusion  and T2-weighted sequences, although the difference was smaller on the T2-weighted  sequence. There was only a small difference in intraprocedural and postprocedural  lesion distance from the midline on both the diffusion and T2-weighted sequences.  CONCLUSIONS: Intraprocedural DWI is both feasible and useful with regard to  predicting final lesion size and providing an early indication of lesion  location. Further research should determine the value of intraprocedural DWI in  predicting delayed clinical outcomes.","2023-10-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1190-1194","","4","139","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36933258","","","","*Essential Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; *Surgery, Computer-Assisted/methods; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; T2-weighted imaging; diagnostic technique; diffusion-weighted imaging; magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this measure does not fully predict  the sonication parameters that would be required or the technical success rates.  The authors aimed to assess other skull characteristics that may also contribute  to technical success. METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied consecutive  patients with essential tremor who were treated by MRgFUS at their center between  2017 and 2021. They evaluated the correlation between the different treatment  parameters, particularly maximum power and energy delivered, with a range of  patients' skull metrics and demographics. Machine learning algorithms were  applied to investigate whether sonication parameters could be predicted from  skull density metrics alone and whether including combined local transducer SDRs  with overall calvarial SDR would increase model accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 62  patients were included in the study. The mean age was 77.1 (SD 9.2) years, and  78% of treatments (49/63) were performed in males. The mean SDR was 0.51 (SD  0.10). Among the evaluated metrics, SDR had the highest correlation with the  maximum power used in treatment (ρ = -0.626, p < 0.001; proportion of local SDR  values ≤ 0.8 group also had ρ = +0.626, p < 0.001) and maximum energy delivered  (ρ = -0.680, p < 0.001). Machine learning algorithms achieved a moderate ability  to predict maximum power and energy required from the local and overall SDRs  (accuracy of approximately 80% for maximum power and approximately 55% for  maximum energy), and high ability to predict average maximum temperature reached  from the local and overall SDRs (approximately 95% accuracy). CONCLUSIONS: The  authors compared a number of skull metrics against SDR and showed that SDR was  one of the best indicators of treatment parameters when used alone. In addition,  a number of other machine learning algorithms are proposed that may be explored  to improve its accuracy when additional data are obtained. Additional metrics  related to eventual sonication parameters should also be identified and explored.","2023-01-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","50-57","","1","138","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35901729","","","","*Essential Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Tremor; Aged; Humans; MR-guided focused ultrasound; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Retrospective Studies; Skull/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Thalamus/diagnostic imaging/surgery; essential tremor; functional neurosurgery; neuromodulation; skull density ratio; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A  total of 35 patients diagnosed with HR-HPV infection-related histological LSIL  who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this prospective study and  treated with FU. The authors used cytometric bead array to measure T-helper type  1 (Th1) cytokine (interleukin [IL] 2, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon γ)  and Th2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10) levels in the cervicovaginal  lavage of patients before and 3 months after FU treatment.

Currently, as  the second most common degenerative disease, PD is a research hotspot in the  field of MRgFUS. The actions of MRgFUS on the brain range from thermoablation,  blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, to neuromodulation. Intensity is a key  determinant of ultrasound actions. Generally, high intensity can be used to  precisely thermoablate brain targets, whereas low intensity can be used as  molecular therapies to modulate neuronal activity and open the BBB in conjunction  with injected microbubbles. Here, we aimed to summarize advances in the  application of MRgFUS for the treatment of PD, with a focus on thermal ablation,  BBB opening, and neuromodulation, in the hope of informing clinicians of current  applications.","2023-04-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","780-787","","7","136","","Chin Med J (Engl)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Chinese Medical Association, produced by Wolters Kluwer, Inc. under the CC-BY-NC-ND license.","","","","","","Place: China PMID: 36914938  PMCID: PMC10150909","","","","*Brain Neoplasms; *Essential Tremor/surgery; *Parkinson Disease/diagnostic imaging/therapy; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The energy is  delivered in the deep layers of the skin, and because of these characteristics,  the risks of severe damage to adjacent tissue and the ocular surface may be  underestimated. Previous reports have demonstrated superficial corneal opacities,  cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, or ocular refractive changes in  different patients following HIFU. In this case, we report deep stromal opacities  associated with anterior uveitis, iris atrophy and lens opacity formation  following a single HIFU superior eyelid application. CASE PRESENTATION: A  47-year-old female presented to the ophthalmic emergency department complaining  of pain, hyperemia and photophobia in the right eye following a HIFU application  to the superior right eyelid. A slit lamp examination showed three  temporal-inferior corneal infiltrates with edema and severe anterior uveitis. The  patient was treated with topical corticosteroids, and six months later, there was  residual corneal opacity, iris atrophy and peripherical cataract formation. No  surgical procedure was needed, and the final vision was Snellen 20/20 (1.0).  CONCLUSION: The risk of severe impairment to the ocular surface and ocular  tissues may be underestimated. Cosmetic surgeons and ophthalmologists must be  aware of the complications, and the long-term follow-up of these changes needs  further investigation and discussion. Safety protocols of the HIFU intensity  threshold for thermal lesions in the eye and the use of protective eye devices  should be better evaluated.","2023-05-22","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","230","","1","23","","BMC Ophthalmol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

The directivity of  modulation is empirically regulated by modifying the stimulation length,  interval, and strength. However, bidirectional neuronal modulations using  ultrasound stimulations are rarely reported. This study presents bidirectional  control of epileptiform activities with repetitive transcranial-focused  ultrasound stimulations in a rat model of drug-induced acute epilepsy. It is  found that repeated transmission of elongated (40 s), ultra-low pressure  (0.25 MPa) ultrasound can fully suppress epileptic activities in  electro-encephalography and cerebral blood volume measurements, while the change  in bursting intervals from 40 to 20 s worsens epileptic activities even with the  same burst length. Furthermore, the suppression induced by 40 s long bursts is  transformed to excitatory states by a subsequent transmission. Bidirectional  modulation of epileptic seizures with repeated ultrasound stimulation is achieved  by regulating the changes in glutamate and γ-Aminobutyric acid levels, as  confirmed by measurements of expressed c-Fos and GAD65 and multitemporal analysis  of neurotransmitters in the interstitial fluid obtained via microdialysis.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e2302404","","2","11","","Adv Sci (Weinh)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

In this work, a strategy combining  physical method - ultrasound and nanomaterial with unique physicochemical  properties was designed to enhance the ECL signal of luminol-O(2) system.  Specifically, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) pretreatment as a  non-invasive method could generate ROS (H(2)O(2), O(2)(•-), OH•, (1)O(2)) in  situ, triggering and boosting the ECL signal of luminol. In addition, 1T/2H  MoS(2) with excellent catalytic activity could catalyze the H(2)O(2) produced in  situ, accelerate the oxidation of luminol and further enhance the ECL response.  At the same time, combined with the catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction,  the constructed ECL biosensing platform showed excellent performance for the  detection of miRNA-155. The concentration range of 0.1 fM ∼ 1 nM with the  detection limit as low as 0.057 fM were obtained.

We aim to automate uterine volumetry for tracking changes  after therapy with a 3D deep learning approach. METHODS: A 3D nnU-Net model in  the default setting and in a modified version including convolutional block  attention modules (CBAMs) was developed on 3D T2-weighted MRI scans. Uterine  segmentation was performed in 44 patients with routine pelvic MRI (standard  group) and 56 patients with uterine fibroids undergoing ultrasound-guided HIFU  therapy (HIFU group). Here, preHIFU scans (n = 56), postHIFU imaging maximum one  day after HIFU (n = 54), and the last available follow-up examination (n = 53,  days after HIFU: 420 ± 377) were included. The training was performed on 80% of  the data with fivefold cross-validation. The remaining data were used as a  hold-out test set. Ground truth was generated by a board-certified radiologist  and a radiology resident. For the assessment of inter-reader agreement, all  preHIFU examinations were segmented independently by both. RESULTS: High  segmentation performance was already observed for the default 3D nnU-Net (mean  Dice score = 0.95 ± 0.05) on the validation sets. Since the CBAM nnU-Net showed  no significant benefit, the less complex default model was applied to the  hold-out test set, which resulted in accurate uterus segmentation (Dice scores:  standard group 0.92 ± 0.07; HIFU group 0.96 ± 0.02), which was comparable to the  agreement between the two readers. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a method for  automatic uterus segmentation which allows a fast and consistent assessment of  uterine volume. Therefore, this method could be used in the clinical setting for  objective assessment of therapeutic response to HIFU therapy.","2023-01-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1","","1","14","","Insights Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

The fragmentation of stones by ultrasound has  applications in medical lithotripsy for the comminution of kidney stones or gall  stones, where their fragmentation is believed to result from the high acoustic  wave energy as well as the formation of cavitation. Cavitation is known to  contribute to erosion and to cause damage away from the target, yet the exact  contribution and mechanisms of cavitation remain currently unclear. Based on in  situ experimental observations, post-exposure microtomography and acoustic  simulations, the present work sheds light on the fundamental role of cavitation  bubbles in the stone surface fragmentation by correlating the detected damage to  the observed bubble activity. Our results show that not all clouds erode the  stone, but only those located in preferential nucleation sites whose locations  are herein examined. Furthermore, quantitative characterizations of the bubble  clouds and their trajectories within the ultrasonic field are discussed. These  include experiments with and without the presence of a model stone in the  acoustic path length. Finally, the optimal stone-to-source distance maximizing  the cavitation-induced surface damage area has been determined. Assuming the  pressure magnitude within the focal region to exceed the cavitation pressure  threshold, this location does not correspond to the acoustic focus, where the  pressure is maximal, but rather to the region where the acoustic beam and thereby  the acoustic cavitation activity near the stone surface is the widest.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","106738","","","102","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

However, definitive  treatments such as radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy are often  associated with many serious adverse effects, harming the physical and mental  health of patients. PRESENT: In recent years, different types of minimally  invasive therapy have been developed to achieve cancer control, continence, and  even potency preservation, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). HIFU  has been proposed for prostate cancer patients to provide an equivalent oncologic  result to definitive treatment, with a reduced adverse effect profile, thus  increasing the interest in HIFU for the treatment of localized prostate cancer.  FUTURE: Sonablate(®) HIFU performed an outstanding cancer control in treating  localized prostate cancer, with low biochemical recurrence and complication  rates. As further long-term follow-up data mature, we anticipate the routine  application of HIFU for localized prostate cancer within the next few years.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","8786-8787","","13","30","","Ann Surg Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

It calculates the transmitted acoustic field in the brain tissue, taking  into account the distortion effects caused by the skull barrier. The simulation  is prepared using scans from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, if available,  computed tomography (CT) and zero-echo time MRI scans. It also calculates the  thermal effects based on a given ultrasound regime, such as the total duration of  exposure, the duty cycle, and acoustic intensity. The tool is designed to work in  tandem with neuronavigation and visualization software, such as 3-DSlicer. It  uses image processing to prepare domains for ultrasound simulation and uses the  BabelViscoFDTD library for transcranial modeling calculations. BabelBrain  supports multiple GPU backends, including Metal, OpenCL, and CUDA, and works on  all major operating systems including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This tool is  particularly optimized for Apple ARM64 systems, which are common in brain imaging  research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 142  retrospective patients, the skeletal muscle index (SMI), skeletal muscle  radiodensity (SMRD), fatty muscle fraction (FMF), and intermuscular fat fraction  (IMFF) were determined on superior mesenteric artery level in pre-interventional  CT. Each marker was tested for associations with sex, age, body mass index (BMI),  and ECOG. The prognostic value of the markers was examined in Kaplan-Meier  analyses with the log-rank test and in uni- and multivariable Cox proportional  hazards (CPH) models. RESULTS: The following significant associations were  observed: Male patients had higher BMI and SMI. Patients with lower ECOG had  lower BMI and SMI. Patients with BMI lower than 21.8 kg/m(2) (median) also showed  lower SMI and IMFF. Patients younger than 63.3 years (median) were found to have  higher SMRD, lower FMF, and lower IMFF. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis,  significantly lower survival times were observed in patients with higher ECOG or  lower SMI. Increased patient risk was observed for higher ECOG, lower BMI, and  lower SMI in univariable CPH analyses for 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival.  Multivariable CPH analysis for 1-year survival revealed increased patient risk  for higher ECOG, lower SMI, lower IMFF, and higher FMF. In multivariable analysis  for 2- and 3-year survival, only ECOG and FMF remained significant. CONCLUSION:  CT-based markers of sarcopenia and myosteatosis show a prognostic value for  assessment of survival in advanced pancreatic cancer patients undergoing HIFU  therapy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The results indicate a greater role of  myosteatosis for additional risk assessment beyond clinical scores, as only FMF  was associated with long-term survival in multivariable CPH analyses along ECOG  and also showed independence to ECOG in group analysis. KEY POINTS: • This study  investigates the prognostic value of CT-based markers of sarcopenia and  myosteatosis for patients with pancreatic cancer treated with high-intensity  focused ultrasound. • Markers for sarcopenia and myosteatosis showed a prognostic  value besides clinical assessment of the physical status by the Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group score. In contrast to muscle size measurements, the  myosteatosis marker fatty muscle fraction demonstrated independence to the  clinical score. • The results indicate that myosteatosis might play a greater  role for additional patient risk assessments beyond clinical assessments of  physical status.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","279-286","","1","34","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 84 patients with VLS.  Among them, 43 cases were treated with FU at a focal depth of 2.5 mm and 41 cases  at a focal depth of 4.0 mm. Therapeutic time, treatment energy, postoperative  efficacy, complications and recurrence rates were compared. RESULTS: No  statistically substantially differences in age, disease course, history of immune  system diseases, lesion size and severity of symptoms were found between the two  groups. All patients successfully received FU therapy. No significant difference  in curative rate was observed between the two groups at 3, 6 and 12 months after  FU therapy. At 12 months after FU therapy, the recurrence rate of the  experimental group (FU treatment at 2.5 mm focal depth) was lower than the  control group (FU treatment at 4.0 mm focal depth) (7.0% vs 24.4%, p = 0.027).

The main  objectives of this study were to evaluate heating under turbulent conditions,  observe perfusion effects, quantify heating in terms of acoustic absorption and  model the experimental data. METHODS: In this study, similar perfluorocarbon  emulsions were circulated at incremental concentrations of 0.07, 0.13, 0.19 and  0.25% v:v through a percolated turbulent flow phantom, more representative of the  biological tissue than a laminar flow phantom. The concentrations represent the  droplet content in only the perfused fluid, rather than the droplet concentration  throughout the entire cross-section. The temperature was measured with magnetic  resonance thermometry, during focused ultrasound sonications of 67 W, 95% duty  cycle and 33 s duration. These were used in Bioheat equation simulations to  investigate in silico the thermal phenomena. The temperature change was compared  with the control condition by circulating de-gassed and de-ionized water through  the flow phantom without droplets. RESULTS: With these 1.24 µm diameter droplets  at 0.25% v:v, the acoustic absorption coefficient increased from 0.93 ± 0.05 at  0.0% v:v to 1.82 ± 0.22 m(-1) at 0.25% v:v using a 0.1 mL s(-1) flow rate.

Real-time ultrasound image guidance is used to ensure safe and  effective treatment. Plane-wave imaging enables tracking of histotripsy bubble  clouds at a high frame rate but lacks adequate contrast. Furthermore, bubble  cloud hyperechogenicity is reduced in abdominal targets, making the development  of contrast-specific sequences for deep-seated targets an active area of  research. Chirp-coded subharmonic imaging was reported previously to enhance  histotripsy bubble cloud detection by a modest 4-6 dB compared to the  conventional sequence. Incorporating additional steps into the signal processing  pipeline could enhance bubble cloud detection and tracking. In this study, we  evaluated the feasibility of combining chirp-coded subharmonic imaging with  Volterra filtering for enhancing bubble cloud detection in vitro. Chirped imaging  pulses were used to track bubble clouds generated in scattering phantoms at a  1-kHz frame rate. Fundamental and subharmonic matched filters were applied to the  received radio frequency signals, followed by a tuned Volterra filter to extract  bubble-specific signatures. For subharmonic imaging, the application of the  quadratic Volterra filter improved the contrast-to-tissue ratio from 5.18 ± 1.29  to 10.90 ± 3.76 dB, relative to the application of the subharmonic matched  filter.

During the course of the disease, brain metastases can occur  in up to 30% of these patients. In most cases, brain metastases are diagnosed  after significant disease progression. The blood-tumor barrier increases the  difficulty of treating brain metastasis by preventing accumulation of  chemotherapy within metastases at therapeutically effective concentrations.  Traditional therapies, such as surgical resection, radiotherapy, and  chemotherapy, have poor efficacy, as reflected by a low median survival rate of  5-8% after post-diagnosis. Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LiFUS) is a new  treatment for enhancing drug accumulation within the brain and brain  malignancies. In this study, we elucidate the effect of clinical LiFUS combined  with chemotherapy on tumor survival and progression in a preclinical model of  triple-negative breast cancer metastasis to the brain. LiFUS significantly  increased the tumor accumulation of 14C-AIB and Texas Red compared to controls  (p< 0.01). LiFUS-mediated opening of the BTB is size-dependent, which is  consistent with our previous studies. Mice receiving LiFUS with combinatorial  Doxil and paclitaxel showed a significant increase in median survival (60 days)  compared to other groups. LiFUS plus combinatorial chemotherapy of paclitaxel and  Doxil also showed the slowest progression of tumor burden compared to  chemotherapy alone or individual chemotherapy and LiFUS combinations. This study  shows that combining LiFUS with timed combinatorial chemotherapeutic treatment is  a potential strategy for improving drug delivery to brain metastases.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1104594","","","13","","Front Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Arsiwala, Blethen, Wolford, Panchal, Sprowls, Fladeland, Kielkowski, Pritt, Wang, Wilson, Carpenter, Finomore, Rezai and Lockman.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36845739  PMCID: PMC9950566","","","","blood-brain barrer; blood-tumor barrier (BTB); chemotherapeutic responses; combinatorial therapeutic regime; drug delivery; efficacy; focused ultrasound (MRgFUS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agar-based TMMs are often  developed mimicking the thermal properties of muscle tissue, while TMMs  simulating fat tissue properties are rarely developed. Herein, twelve agar-based  TMMs were iteratively developed with varied concentrations of agar, water,  glycerol and propan-2-ol, and characterized for their suitability in emulating  the thermal conductivity of human fat tissue. METHODS: Varied agar concentrations  (2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 12%, 16% and 20% w/v) were utilized for developing seven  water-based TMMs, while a 20% w/v agar concentration was utilized for developing  two water/alcohol-based TMMs (50% v/v water and 50% v/v either glycerol or  propan-2-ol) and three alcohol-based TMMs (varied glycerol and propan-2-ol  concentrations). Thermal conductivity was measured for all TMMs, and the tissue  mimicking material (TMM) exhibiting thermal conductivity closest to human fat was  considered the optimum fat TMM and was further characterized using ultrasound  (US) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). RESULTS: For the seven water-based  TMMs an inverse linear trend was observed between thermal conductivity and  increased agar concentration, being between 0.524 and 0.445 W/m K. Alcohol  addition decreased thermal conductivity of the two water/alcohol-based TMMs to  about 0.33 W/m K, while in the alcohol-based TMMs, increased concentrations of  propan-2-ol emerged as a modifier of thermal conductivity. The optimum fat TMM  (33.3% v/v glycerol and 66.7% v/v propan-2-ol) exhibited a 0.231 W/m K thermal  conductivity, and appeared hypoechoic on US images and with increased brightness  on T1-Weighted MRI images. CONCLUSION: The optimum fat TMM emulates the thermal  conductivity of human fat tissue and exhibits a fat-like appearance on US and MRI  images. The TMM is cost-effective and has a long lifespan and possesses great  potential for use in HIFU applications as a fat TMM.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","505-515","","2","26","","J Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

However, its penetration depth in the tissue is insufficient for  achieving accurate intraoperative navigation, leading to residual tumor tissue.  Nanomedicine provides a new opportunity for PA imaging to guide HIFU surgery.  Studies have found that the hypoxic heterogeneity of tumor is effectively  reversed by HIFU. Herein, a specific metal-organic framework nanosystem,  constructed by coordination of banoxantrone (AQ4N) and Mn(2+) , is designed based  on HIFU to reverse the hypoxic heterogeneity of tumors. It can provide exogenous  light-absorbing substances, thus improving the penetrability of PA imaging signal  through the deep tissue and achieving clearer PA imaging for guiding HIFU  surgery. In turn, AQ4N, in the hypoxic homogenous environment of the tumor  provided by HIFU, is activated sequentially to specifically treat the residual  hypoxic tumor cells. This combination treatment manifests higher tumor  suppressors activation and lower expression of genes related to tumor  progression. This strategy addresses the dissatisfaction with PA imaging-guided  HIFU therapy and is promising for translation into a clinical combination  regimen.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e2202348","","2","12","","Adv Healthc Mater","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 36281898","","","","*Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Metal-Organic Frameworks; *Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/therapy; *Photoacoustic Techniques/methods; HIFU; Humans; hypoxia-activated; nanomedicines; photoacoustic imaging; tumor theranostics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have shown that CSC-targeted therapy is effective  in inhibiting tumorigenesis and transmission. However, CD133 targeted therapy  combined with HIFU for pancreatic cancer is absent. PURPOSE: To improve  therapeutic efficiency and minimize side effects, we carry a potent combination  of CSCs antibody with synergist by an effective and visualized delivery  nanocarrier to pancreatic cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multifunctional  CD133-targeted nanovesicles (CD133-grafted Cy5.5/PFOB@P-HVs) with encapsulated  perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) in a 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) shell  modified with poly ethylene glycol (PEG) and superficially modified with CD133  and Cy 5.5 were constructed following the prescribed order. The nanovesicles were  characterized for the biological and chemical characteristics feature. We  explored the specific targeting capacity in vitro and the therapeutic effect in  vivo. RESULTS: The in vitro targeting experiment and in vivo FL and ultrasonic  experiments showed the aggregation of CD133-grafted Cy5.5/PFOB@P-HVs around CSCs.  In vivo FL imaging experiments demonstrated that the nanovesicles assemble for  the highest concentration in the tumor at 24 h after administration. Under HIFU  irradiation, the synergistic efficacy of the combination of the CD133-targeting  carrier and HIFU for tumor treatment was obvious. CONCLUSION: CD133-grafted  Cy5.5/PFOB@P-HVs combined with HIFU irradiation could enhance the tumor treatment  effect not only by improving the delivery of nanovesicles but also by enhancing  the HIFU thermal and mechanical effects in the tumor microenvironment, which is a  highly effective targeted therapy for treating pancreatic cancer.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2539-2552","","","18","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Wang et al.","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 37207110  PMCID: PMC10188615","","","","*Pancreatic Neoplasms/therapy; *Ultrasonics; AC133 Antigen; Cell Line, Tumor; Coloring Agents; Humans; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Tumor Microenvironment; Ultrasonography; cancer stem cells; high-intensity focused ultrasound; in vivo fluorescent imaging; multifunctional nanovesicles; ultrasonic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We retrospectively  interrogated the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for men with clinically  localized PCa between 2010 and 2017. The main outcome was receipt of local tumor  ablation with either cryo- or laser-ablation, and ""other method of local tumor  destruction including high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)"". Patient level,  hospital level, and demographic variables were collected. Mixed effect logistic  regression models were fitted to identify separately patient- and hospital-level  predictors of receipt of local ablative therapy. RESULTS: Overall, 11,278  patients received ablative therapy, of whom 78.8% had cryotherapy, 15.6% had  laser, and 5.7% had another method including HIFU. At the patient level, men with  intermediate-risk PCa were more likely to be treated with local ablative therapy  (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.00-1.11; p = 0.05), as were men with Charlson Comorbidity  Index > 1 (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.29-1.43; p < 0.01), men between 71 and 80 years (OR  3.70; 95% CI 3.43-3.99; p < 0.01), men with Medicare insurance (OR 1.38; 95%  1.31-1.46; p < 0.01), and an income < $47,999 (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.06-1.21;  p < 0.01). At the hospital-level, local ablative therapy was less likely to be  performed in academic/research facilities (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.32-0.64; p < 0.01).  CONCLUSIONS: Local ablative therapy for PCa treatment is more commonly offered  among older and comorbid patients. Future studies should investigate the uptake  of these technologies in non-hospital-based settings and in light of recent  changes in insurance coverage.","2023-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1309-1315","","5","41","","World J Urol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

So far, however, little is  known about the impact of tcMRgFUS on structural connectivity. The objective of  this study was to detect microstructural changes in tremor- and motor-related  white matter tracts in ET patients treated with tcMRgFUS thalamotomy. Methods:  Eleven patients diagnosed with ET were enrolled in this tcMRgFUS thalamotomy  study. For each patient, 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI) including  structural and diffusion MRI were acquired and the Clinical Rating Scale for  Tremor was assessed before the procedure as well as 1 year after the treatment.  Diffusion MRI tractography was performed to identify the  cerebello-thalamo-cortical tract (CTCT), the medial lemniscus, and the  corticospinal tract in both hemispheres on pre-treatment data. Pre-treatment  tractography results were co-registered to post-treatment diffusion data.  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA),  mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD), were averaged across the  tracts in the pre- and post-treatment data. Results: The mean value of  tract-specific DTI metrics changed significantly within the thalamic lesion and  in the CTCT on the treated side (p < 0.05). Changes of DTI-derived indices within  the CTCT correlated well with lesion overlap (FA: r = -0.54, p = 0.04; MD:  r = 0.57, p = 0.04); RD: r = 0.67, p = 0.036). Further, a trend was seen for the  correlation between changes of DTI-derived indices within the CTCT and clinical  improvement (FA: r = 0.58; p = 0.062; MD: r = -0.52, p = 0.64; RD: r = -0.61  p = 0.090). Conclusions: Microstructural changes were detected within the CTCT  after tcMRgFUS, and these changes correlated well with lesion-tract overlap. Our  results show that diffusion MRI is able to detect the microstructural effects of  tcMRgFUS, thereby further elucidating the treatment mechanism, and ultimately to  improve targeting prospectively. Impact statement The results of this study  demonstrate microstructural changes within the cerebello-thalamo-cortical  pathways 1 year after MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy. Even more,  microstructural changes within the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways correlated  significantly with clinical outcome. These findings do not only highly emphasize  the need of new targeting strategies for MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy  but also help to elucidate the treatment mechanism of it.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","28-38","","1","13","","Brain Connect","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35678063  PMCID: PMC9942176","","","","*Essential Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Brain; Diffusion Tensor Imaging/methods; Humans; MR-guided focused ultrasound; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Tremor; diffusion tensor imaging; essential tremor; microstructural change; structural connectivity; tractography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intrinsic threshold histotripsy uses single-cycle pulses to generate bubble  clouds when the dominant negative pressure phase exceeds an intrinsic threshold  of ∼25-30 MPa. The ablation efficiency is dependent upon the size and density of  bubbles within the bubble cloud. This work investigates the effects of  dual-frequency pulsing schemes on the bubble cloud behavior and ablation  efficiency in intrinsic threshold histotripsy. A modular 500 kHz:3 MHz  histotripsy transducer treated agarose phantoms using dual-frequency histotripsy  pulses with a 1:1 pressure ratio from 500 kHz and 3 MHz frequency elements and  varying arrival times for the 3 MHz pulse relative to the arrival of the 500 kHz  pulse (-100 ns, 0 ns, and +100 ns). High-speed optical imaging captured  cavitation effects to characterize bubble cloud and individual bubble dynamics.  The effects of dual-frequency pulsing on lesion formation and ablation efficiency  were also investigated in red blood cell (RBC) phantoms. Results showed that the  single bubble and bubble cloud size for dual-frequency cases were intermediate to  published results for the component single-frequencies of 500 kHz and 3 MHz.  Additionally, bubble cloud size and dynamics were shown to be altered by the  arrival time of the 3 MHz pulse with respect to the 500 kHz pulse, with more  uniform cloud expansion and collapse observed for early (-100 ns) arrival.  Finally, RBC phantom experiments showed that dual-frequency exposures were  capable of generating precise lesions with smaller areas and higher ablation  efficiencies than previously published results for 500 kHz or 3 MHz.

METHODS: A total of 299  adenomyosis patients who underwent HIFU and completed a one-year follow-up were  retrospectively reviewed. Based on the SI values of adenomyosis relative to  myometrium and endometrium on T2WI MRI, the patients were classified into three  groups: the hypointense adenomyosis (Hypo-AM) group, the isointense adenomyosis  (Iso-AM) group, and the hyperintense adenomyosis (Hyper-AM) group. The  non-perfused volume ratio (NPVr) and relief of dysmenorrhea were used to assess  the therapeutic efficacy. Optimal cutpoints (CPs) of NPVr were determined using  the postoperative dysmenorrhea score as an anchor. Logistic regression analysis  was used to test the relationship between the NPVr and SI. RESULTS: The clinical  effectiveness rate was significantly lower in the Hyper-AM group than in the  Hypo-AM and Iso-AM groups (P < 0.05 for both). The NPVr in the Hypo-AM and Iso-AM  groups were significantly higher than that in the Hyper-AM group (P < 0.05 for  both). The optimal CP was 54.0% for NPVr. Logistic regression analysis showed  that the SI on T2WI was an effect factor for NPVr (P < 0.05), and the probability  of NPVr ≥54.0% decreased continuously as the SI of adenomyosis increased.  CONCLUSIONS: The NPVr of 54.0% has a clinically significant impact on  dysmenorrhea scores in patients.

To increase the local drug diffusion gradient, high  doses of chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin can be released from  thermally-sensitive liposomes (ThermoDox®) using ultrasound-mediated hyperthermia  at the tumour target. PanDox is designed as a Phase 1 single centre study to  investigate enhancing drug delivery to adult patients with non-operable  pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. The study compares a single cycle of either  conventional doxorubicin alone or ThermoDox® with focused ultrasound-induced  hyperthermia for targeted drug release. METHODS: Adults with non-resectable  pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma are allocated to receive a single cycle of  either doxorubicin alone (Arm A) or ThermoDox® with focused ultrasound-induced  hyperthermia (Arm B), based on patient- and tumour-specific safety conditions.  Participants in Arm B will undergo a general anaesthetic and pre-heating of the  tumour by extra-corporal focused ultrasound (FUS). Rather than employing invasive  thermometry, ultrasound parameters are derived from a patient-specific treatment  planning model to reach the 41 °C target temperature for drug release. ThermoDox®  is then concurrently infused with further ultrasound exposure. Tumour biopsies at  the targeted site from all patients are analysed post-treatment using high  performance liquid chromatography to quantify doxorubicin delivered to the  tumour. The primary endpoint is defined as a statistically significant  enhancement in concentration of total intra-tumoural doxorubicin, comparing  samples from patients receiving liposomal drug with FUS to free drug alone.  Participants are followed for 21 days post-treatment to assess secondary  endpoints, including radiological assessment to measure changes in tumour  activity by Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid  Tumours (PERCIST) criteria, adverse events and patient-reported symptoms.  DISCUSSION: This early phase study builds on previous work targeting tumours in  the liver to investigate whether enhancement of chemotherapy delivery using  ultrasound-mediated hyperthermia can be translated to the stroma-dense  environment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. If successful, it could herald a  new approach towards managing these difficult-to-treat tumours. TRIAL  REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04852367 . Registered 21(st)  April 2022.

This study  aims to verify the ability of a novel approach of dual-frequency mode combined  with two-stage millisecond-length ultrasound pulses (DF-TS) to accelerate the  treatment of murine subcutaneous 4T1 tumors and determine immune changes after  treatment. A custom-designed 1.1-/2.2-MHz two-element confocal-annular array was  used to treat approximately 6-mm tumors under ultrasound guidance and real-time  monitoring. Two-stage millisecond-length ultrasound pulses were used to generate  approximate cuboid ablation volumes (diagonal 5-6 mm) within each tumor, with a  dose of 100 pulses/point. Immune effects were characterized by changes of  pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and infiltration levels of immune cells. In all  targeted treatment areas, bubble cloud activity was visualized by ultrasound  monitoring. The novel protocol resulted in elliptical and controllable sized  lesions, reducing the number of scanning points, and was generally well  tolerated. After treatment, tumor growth experienced a seven-day stagnation  period, the survival period of mice was prolonged, and the levels of  pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell infiltration increased. This study  demonstrates that DF-TS boiling histotripsy (BH) has a noninvasive, efficient,  and precise ablation ability for TNBC and potentially enhances immune responses.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1773-1785","","12","70","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37871099","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/therapy; Animals; Humans; Mice; Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Studies that compared HIFU-microbubble combination with  HIFU-only in patients with uterine fibroids were searched from inception to April  2022. The standardized mean difference (SMD) or relative risk (RR) with 95%  confidence interval (CI) for different outcome parameters was calculated.  RESULTS: Seven studies were included, with a total of 901 patients (519 in the  combination group and 382 in the HIFU-only group). The energy consumption for  treating 1 cm(3) of the lesion in the combination group was less than that in the  HIFU-only group [SMD =  - 2.19, 95%CI (- 3.81, - 0.57), p = 0.008]. The use of  microbubbles was associated with shortening the duration of the treatment and  sonication [SMD =  - 2.60, 95%CI (- 4.09, - 1.10), p = 0.0007; SMD =  - 2.11,  95%CI (- 3.30, - 0.92), p = 0.0005]. The rates of significant greyscale changes  during HIFU were greater in the combination group, as well as the increase of  non-perfused volume ratio [RR = 1.26, 95%CI (1.04, 1.54), p = 0.02; SMD = 0.32,  95%CI (0.03, 0.61), p = 0.03]. The average sonication durations to reach  significant greyscale changes and for ablating 1 cm(3) of the fibroid lesion were  shorter in the combination group [SMD =  - 1.24, 95%CI (- 2.02, - 0.45),  p = 0.002; SMD =  - 0.22, 95%CI (- 0.42, - 0.02), p = 0.03]. The two groups had  similar post-HIFU adverse effects, while the combination group had fewer  intraprocedural adverse events like abdominal pain, sacrum pain, and leg pain.  CONCLUSIONS: Sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles can be safely used to enhance and  accelerate the ablation effects of HIFU in the treatment of uterine fibroids.  CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The combination of HIFU with sulfur hexafluoride  microbubbles offers a promising non-invasive treatment option for patients with  uterine fibroids. KEY POINTS: • Sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles combined with  ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU) has potential  advantages in the treatment of uterine fibroids. • Sulfur hexafluoride  microbubbles not only enhance the effects of USgHIFU treatment for uterine  fibroids but also shorten its duration. • Sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles do not  increase the incidence of USgHIFU-related adverse events in the treatment of  uterine fibroids.","2023-11-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

In this study, gram-negative bacteria  (Escherichia coli) in suspension were used as model bacteria to evaluate the  effectiveness of two regimens of histotripsy treatments: cavitation histotripsy  (CH) and boiling histotripsy (BH). METHODS: Ten-milliliter volumes of Escherichia  coli were treated at different negative focal pressure amplitudes and over time  periods up to 40 min. Cavitation activity was characterized with coaxial passive  cavitation detection (PCD) and synchronized plane wave B-mode imaging. RESULTS:  CH treatments exhibited a threshold behavior that was consistent with PCD metrics  of cavitation. Above the threshold, bacterial inactivation followed a  monotonically increasing log-linear relationship that indicated an exponential  inactivation rate. BH exhibited no threshold, but instead followed a different  monotonically increasing inactivation rate. Inactivation rates were larger for BH  at or below the CH threshold, and larger for CH substantially above the  threshold. CH studies performed at different pulse lengths at the same duty cycle  had similar inactivation rates, suggesting that at any given pressure amplitude,  the ""on time"" was the most important variable for inactivating E. coli. The  maximum inactivation was produced by CH at the highest pressure amplitudes used,  leading to a log reduction >4.2 for a 40 min treatment. CONCLUSION: The results  of this study suggest that both CH and BH can be used to inactivate E. coli in  suspension, with the optimal regimen depending on the attainable peak negative  focal pressure at the target.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2451-2458","","12","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed temporary T1 contrast  enhancement in the sonication area, verifying the BBB opening. Several low-signal  intensity spots were observed in the T2 susceptibility-weighted angiography  images, which were also reversible and temporary.

However, there is insufficient comparative research evidence on clinical efficacy  and subsequent pregnancy outcomes after previous CSP treatment. This study aims  to investigate the efficacy, safety, and subsequent pregnancy outcomes of HIFU-a  compared to UAE before USg-D&C for the treatment of CSP. METHODS: Between January  2016 and July 2020, a total of 272 patients received the pretreatment with HIFU-a  or UAE(HIFU-a group: n = 118; UAE group: n = 154). The clinical characteristics,  treatment success rate, postoperative pregnancy rate and outcome of the two  groups were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: The demographic characteristics of  the two groups were similar. After pretreatment, the adverse events rate of  HIFU-a group was lower than that of UAE group (10.40% (16/154) vs. 40.70%  (48/118), P = 0.00). All patients received the USg-D&C. The HIFU-a group was of  less intraoperative blood loss (10.00 (5.00-20.00) vs. 12.50 (5.00-30.00) ml,  P = 0.03). There was no statistically significant difference between the two  groups in success rates. However, the HIFU-a group was of a shorter duration of  postoperative vaginal bleeding (12.00 (9.00-13.00) vs. 14.00 (12.00-15.00) days,  P = 0.00). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of  subsequent pregnancy rates (P = 0.317). However, the recurrent CSP (rCSP) rate in  the HIFU-a group was lower than that in the UAE group (7.70% (6/78) vs.  19.70%(13/66), P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: CSP treated with either HIFU-a or UAE  combined with USg-D&C was safe and effective. Although no significant difference  was found in the subsequent pregnancy outcomes of the two groups, the rCSP was  more common in the UAE group.

However,  the manual fine-tuning of fiber tracking and segmentation required for accurate  treatment planning is time-consuming and demands expert knowledge of complex  neuroimaging tools. This raises the question of whether a fully automated  pipeline is feasible or if manual intervention remains necessary. METHODS: We  investigate the dependence on fiber tractography algorithms, segmentation  approaches, and degrees of automation, specifically for essential tremor therapy  planning. For that purpose, we compare an automatic pipeline with a manual  approach that requires the manual definition of the target point and is based on  FMRIB software library (FSL) and other open-source tools. RESULTS: Our findings  demonstrate the high feasibility of automatic fiber tracking and the automated  determination of standard treatment coordinates. Employing an automatic fiber  tracking approach and deep learning (DL)-supported standard coordinate  calculation, we achieve anatomically meaningful results comparable to a manually  performed FSL-based pipeline. Individual cases may still exhibit variations,  often stemming from differences in region of interest (ROI) segmentation.  Notably, the DL-based approach outperforms registration-based methods in  producing accurate segmentations. Precise ROI segmentation proves crucial,  surpassing the importance of fine-tuning parameters or selecting algorithms.  Correct thalamus and red nucleus segmentation play vital roles in ensuring  accurate pathway computation. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential for  automation in fiber tracking algorithms for tcFUS therapy, but acknowledges the  ongoing need for expert verification and integration of anatomical expertise in  treatment planning.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1272061","","","2","","Front Neuroimaging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Klein, Gerken, Agethen, Rothlübbers, Upadhyay, Purrer, Schmeel, Borger, Kovalevsky, Rachmilevitch, Shapira, Wüllner and Jenne.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37953746  PMCID: PMC10637361","","","","essential tremor; fiber tractography; segmentation; therapy planning; transcranial focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Histotripsy is a non-invasive, non-thermal focused ultrasound  therapy and recently has been found to be effective at removal of biofilm from  medical catheters. Previously established histotripsy methods for biofilm  removal, however, would require several hours of use to effectively treat a  full-length medical catheter. Here, we investigate the potential to increase the  speed and efficiency with which biofilms can be ablated from catheters using  histotripsy. METHODS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) biofilms were cultured in in  vitro Tygon catheter mimics and treated with histotripsy using a 1 MHz  histotripsy transducer and a variety of histotripsy pulsing rates and scanning  methods. The improved parameters identified in these studies were then used to  explore the bactericidal effect of histotripsy on planktonic PA14 suspended in a  catheter mimic. RESULTS: Histotripsy can be used to remove biofilm and kill  bacteria at substantially increased speeds compared with previously established  methods. Near-complete biofilm removal was achieved at treatment speeds up to 1  cm/s, while a 4.241 log reduction in planktonic bacteria was achieved with 2.4  cm/min treatment. CONCLUSION: These results represent a 500-fold increase in  biofilm removal speeds and a 6.2-fold increase in bacterial killing speeds  compared with previously published methods. These findings indicate that  histotripsy shows promise for the treatment of catheter-associated biofilms and  planktonic bacteria in a clinically relevant time frame.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2152-2159","","9","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

This  limits the set of scans that can be performed to guide and assess the effects of  treatment. An electromagnetic simulation study was performed to elucidate the  mechanisms causing the dark band. Based on the results, a pair of passive  antennas in a ""propeller-beanie"" configuration were designed to manipulate the  reflected waves to avoid signal cancellation within the brain. The antennas were  optimized and validated with in-vivo experiments and hydrophone measurements. The  simulation study revealed that the dark band is caused by RF waves reflected from  the transducer's ground plane, which cancel with incoming waves from the  scanner's body coil. The passive antennas shifted the dark band out of the brain  and increased transmit efficiency in the center of brain 2.3 times while  improving field homogeneity by 50%. They also increased receive sensitivity and  SNR in anatomic and temperature imaging. They caused no detectable distortion in  hydrophone-measured focal pressure profiles. The conductive ground planes and  coupling media used in tcMRgFUS and other piezoelectric FUS transducers interact  with a 3 T scanner's RF fields to reduce transmit efficiency and SNR. For  tcMRgFUS scenario, ""propeller beanie"" passive reflecting antennas alleviated  these effects. This could make a broader set of imaging sequences available to  guide tcMRgFUS treatment.","2023-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","169-178","","","103","","Magn Reson Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

The Sonalleve system has two versions V1 and V2 of the therapeutic array,  with differences in focusing angle, focus depth, arrangement of elements, and the  size of a central opening that is twice larger in the V2 system compared to the  V1. The goal of this study was to compare the performance of the V1 and V2  transducers for generating high-amplitude shock-wave fields and to reveal the  impact of different array geometries on shock amplitudes at the focus. Nonlinear  modeling of the field in water using boundary conditions reconstructed from  holography measurements shows that at the same power output, the V2 array  generates 10-15-MPa lower shock amplitudes at the focus. Consequently,  substantially higher power levels are required for the V2 system to reach the  same shock-wave exposure conditions in histotripsy-type treatments. Although this  difference is mainly caused by the smaller focusing angle of the V2 array, the  larger central opening of the V2 array has a nontrivial impact. By excluding  coherently interacting weakly focused waves coming from the central part of the  source, the presence of the central opening results in a somewhat higher  effective focusing angle and thus higher shock amplitudes at the focus.  Axisymmetric equivalent source models were constructed for both arrays, and the  importance of including the central opening was demonstrated. These models can be  used in the ""HIFU beam"" software for simulating nonlinear fields of the Sonalleve  V1 and V2 systems in water and flat-layered biological tissues.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","521-537","","6","70","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37030675  PMCID: PMC10280052","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Liver/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Ultrasonography; Water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October  2017 and January 2022, 129 infertile patients with adenomyosis who wished to  conceive were treated with HIFU. Based on the relationship between the  adenomyotic lesion, the endometrium, and the subserosa of the uterus on magnetic  resonance imaging, the adenomyotic lesions were divided into internal, external,  intramural, and full-thickness types. Menstruation pain score, menstruation blood  volume score, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, reproductive results,  pregnancy and delivery complications, and other clinical variables were compared  among these four groups. RESULTS: Patients with external adenomyosis had the  greatest menstrual distress, whereas patients with internal adenomyosis had the  greatest menstrual blood volume. Dysmenorrhea and heavy menstruation were  significantly improved after HIFU treatment in all groups. AMH levels were not  significantly different before and six months after HIFU.

However,  treatment of diffuse regions across the brain along with the effect on  Alzheimer's disease relevant pathology need to be better characterized. This  study is an open-labelled single-arm trial (NCT04118764) to investigate the  feasibility of modulating BBB permeability in the default mode network and the  impact on cognition, amyloid and tau pathology as well as BBB integrity. Nine  participants [mean age 70.2 ± 7.2 years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination  (MMSE) 21.9] underwent three biweekly procedures with follow-up visits up to 6  months. The BBB permeability of the bilateral hippocampi, anterior cingulate  cortex and precuneus was transiently increased without grade 3 or higher adverse  events. Participants did not experience worsening trajectory of cognitive decline  (ADAS-cog11, MMSE). Whole brain vertex-based analysis of the 18F-florbetaben PET  imaging demonstrated clusters of modest SUVR reduction in the right  parahippocampal and inferior temporal lobe. However, CSF and blood biomarkers did  not demonstrate any amelioration of Alzheimer's disease pathology (P-tau181,  amyloid-β42/40 ratio), nor did it show persistent BBB dysfunction (plasma  PDGFRbeta and CSF-to-plasma albumin ratio). This study provides neuroimaging and  fluid biomarker data to characterize the safety profile of MRgFUS BBB modulation  in neurodegeneration as a potential strategy for enhanced therapeutic delivery.","2023-03-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","865-872","","3","146","","Brain","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2023.

Multi-wavelength photoacoustic (MWPA) imaging makes this change easier to detect  by repeating PA imaging at multiple optical wavelengths and sampling the optical  absorption spectrum more thoroughly. Real-time pixel-wise classification in MWPA  imaging can assist clinicians in monitoring HIFU lesion formation and will be a  crucial milestone towards full HIFU therapy automation based on artificial  intelligence. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to segment  HIFU lesions in MWPA images. Ex vivo bovine tissue is ablated with HIFU and  imaged via MWPA imaging. The acquired MWPA images are then used to train and test  a convolutional neural network (CNN) for lesion segmentation. Traditional machine  learning algorithms are also trained and tested to compare with the CNN, and the  results show that the performance of the CNN significantly exceeds traditional  machine learning algorithms. Feature selection is conducted to reduce the number  of wavelengths to facilitate real-time implementation while retaining good  segmentation performance. This study demonstrates the feasibility and high  performance of the deep-learning-based lesion segmentation method in MWPA imaging  to monitor HIFU lesion formation and the potential to implement this method in  real time.","2023-09-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","9","10","","Bioengineering (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37760164  PMCID: PMC10526078","","","","convolutional neural network; deep learning; high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy; lesion segmentation; machine learning; multi-wavelength photoacoustic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diels-Alder cycloadducts were used to crosslink  polycaprolactone (PCL) polymers and underwent a retro Diels-Alder reaction when  stimulated with HIFU. Two Diels-Alder polymer compositions were explored to  evaluate the link between reverse reaction energy barriers and polymer  degradation rates. PCL crosslinked with isosorbide was also used as a  non-Diels-Alder-based control polymer. An increase of HIFU exposure time and  amplitude correlated with an increase of PCL degradation for Diels-Alder-based  polymers. Ultrasound imaging during HIFU allowed for real-time visualization of  the on-demand degradation through cavitation-based mechanisms. The temperature  surrounding the sample was monitored with a thermocouple during HIFU stimulation;  a minimal increase in temperature was observed. PCL polymers were characterized  using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), optical profilometry, and  mechanical testing. PCL degradation byproducts were identified by mass  spectrometry, and their cytocompatibility was evaluated in vitro.

This review summarizes the observations and results  from preclinical histotripsy studies in the liver, kidney, and pancreas. Key  findings from these studies include the ability to make a clinically relevant  treatment zone in each organ with maintained collagenous architecture,  potentially allowing treatments in areas not currently amenable to thermal  ablation. Treatments across organ capsules have proven safe, including in  anticoagulated models which may expand patients eligible for treatment or  eliminate the risk associated with taking patients off anti-coagulation.  Treatment zones are well-defined with imaging and rapidly resorb, which may allow  improved evaluation of treatment zones for residual or recurrent tumor.  Understanding the effects of histotripsy in animal models will help inform  physicians adopting histotripsy for human clinical use.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2272065","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37875279  PMCID: PMC10629829","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Neoplasms/therapy; Animals; Histotripsy; Humans; Kidney; Liver/surgery; Models, Animal; abdomen; ablation; kidney; liver; pancreas; renal; tumor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  A total of 238 patients with internal adenomyosis and 167 patients with external  adenomyosis who received HIFU treatment were enrolled. HIFU treatment results and  adverse effects between patients with internal and external adenomyosis were  compared. RESULTS: The treatment time and sonication time for patients with  external adenomyosis were significantly longer than that for patients with  internal adenomyosis. The total energy used and EEF for patients with external  adenomyosis were higher than that for patients with internal adenomyosis  (p < 0.05). The pre-HIFU median dysmenorrhea score in patients with internal or  external adenomyosis was 5 or 8 points, the median score decreased to 1 or 3  points in these two groups at 18-month post-HIFU (p < 0.05).

While useful for protecting neural tissue from  harmful substances, brain-related diseases are difficult to treat due to this  barrier, as it also limits the efficacy of drug delivery. To address this,  promising new approaches for enhancing drug delivery are based on disrupting the  BBB using physical means, including optical/photothermal therapy, electrical  stimulation, and acoustic/mechanical stimulation. These physical mechanisms can  temporarily and locally open the BBB, allowing drugs and other substances to  enter. Focused ultrasound is particularly promising, with the ability to focus  energies to targeted, deep-brain regions. In this review, we examine recent  advances in physical approaches for temporary BBB disruption, describing their  underlying mechanisms as well as evaluating the utility of these physical  approaches with regard to their potential risks and limitations. While these  methods have demonstrated efficacy in disrupting the BBB, their safety,  comparative efficacy, and practicality for clinical use remain an ongoing topic  of research.","2023-11-28","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","87","","1","20","","Fluids Barriers CNS","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

In this paper, we develop an array-based HIFU system integrated with  real-time ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. The array-based HIFU  transducer can be dynamically focused in a lateral range of ∼16 mm and an axial  range of ∼40 mm via electronically adjusting the excitation phase map. To monitor  the HIFU therapy progress in real-time, sequential HIFU transmission, PA imaging,  PA thermometry, and US imaging are implemented to display the dual-modal images  and record the local temperature changes. Co-registered dual-modal images show  structural and functional information and thus can guide the HIFU therapy for  precise positioning and dosage control. Besides therapy, the multi-element HIFU  transducer can also be used to acquire US images to precisely align the imaging  coordinates with the HIFU coordinates. Phantom experiments validate the precise  and dynamic steering capability of HIFU ablation.

On dysmenorrhea score at 6 months there  was significantly different higher heterogeneity with P < 0.00001 (I(2) = 100%  WMD 21.44 [6.34, 36.53]) with statistical significance P = 0.005. At 12 months  there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.00001 (I(2) = 100%  WMD 23.47 [6.00, 40.94]) with statistically significant P < 0.008. At 24 months  there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.0005 (I(2) = 92% WMD  6.05 [4.81, 7.30]) with statistical significance P < 0.00001. HIFU combined with  GnRH-a and LNG-IUS on menstrual score at 3 months was significantly different  higher heterogeneity with P < 0.00001 (I(2) = 100% WMD 56.23 [16.01, 96.45]) with  statistical significance P = 0.006. At 6 months there was significantly different  higher heterogeneity P < 0.00001 (I(2) = 99% WMD 93.86 [64.15, 123.57]) with  statistical significance P < 0.00001. At 12 months there was significantly  different higher heterogeneity P < 0.00001 (I(2) = 99% WMD 97.13 [67.81, 126.46])  with statistical significance P < 0.00001 compared to treatments with only HIFU  and HIFU combined with GnRH-a. HIFU combined with GnRH-a and LNG-IUS treatment is  more effective than only HIFU monotherapy and HIFU combined with GnRH-a.","2023-03","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","226-238","","2","62","","Taiwan J Obstet Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023.

The microbubbles were administered  with either local or vascular injections (that mimic systemic injections) in  perfused and non-perfused ex vivo porcine liver under ultrasound image guidance.  METHODS: Porcine liver was insonified for 30 s with a single-element HIFU  transducer (0.9 MHz, 0.413 ms, 82% duty cycle, focal pressures of 0.6-3.5 MPa).  Contrast microbubbles were injected either locally or through the vasculature. A  needle thermocouple at the focus measured temperature elevation. Diagnostic  ultrasound (Philips iU22, C5-1 probe) guided placement of the thermocouple and  delivery of microbubbles and monitored the procedure in real time. RESULTS: At  lower acoustic pressures (0.6 and 1.2 MPa) in non-perfused liver, inertial  cavitation of the injected microbubbles led to greater temperatures at the focus  compared with HIFU-only treatments. At higher pressures (2.4 and 3.5 MPa) native  inertial cavitation in the tissue (without injecting microbubbles) resulted in  temperature elevations similar to those after injecting microbubbles. The heated  area was larger when using microbubbles at all pressures. In the presence of  perfusion, only local injections provided a sufficiently high concentration of  microbubbles necessary for significant temperature enhancement. CONCLUSION: Local  injections of microbubbles provide a higher concentration of microbubbles in a  smaller area, avoiding acoustic shadowing, and can lead to higher temperature  elevation at lower pressures and increase the size of the heated area at all  pressures.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1852-1860","","8","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

However, radical prostatectomy may cause the  deterioration of urinary and sexual function, and radiation-induced hemorrhagic  cystitis and severe rectal bleeding are risk factors for fatal conditions in  patients after radiation therapy. With the recent development of magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) for the localization of clinically significant PC (csPC)  and treatment modalities, ""focal therapy"", which cures csPC while preserving  anatomical structures related to urinary and sexual functions, has become a  minimally invasive treatment for localized PC. Based on the clinical results of  transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for localized PC in the  whole gland and focal therapy, HIFU is considered an attractive treatment option  for focal therapy. Recently, the short-term clinical results of transurethral  high-intensity directional ultrasound (HIDU) have been reported. With the  resolution of some issues, HIDU may be commonly used for PC treatment similar to  HIFU. Because HIFU and HIDU have limitations regarding the treatment of patients  with large prostate calcifications and large prostate volumes, the proper use of  these modalities will enable the treatment of any target area in the prostate. To  establish a standard treatment strategy for localized PC, pair-matched and  historically controlled studies are required to verify the oncological and  functional outcomes of ultrasound treatment for patients with localized PC.","2023-10-03","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","J Med Ultrason (2001)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Accurate monitoring and guidance of  ultrasound energy is crucial for effective FUS treatment. Although ultrasound  (US) imaging is a well-suited modality for FUS monitoring, US-guided FUS (USgFUS)  faces challenges in achieving precise monitoring, leading to unpredictable  ablation shapes and a lack of quantitative monitoring. The demand for precise FUS  monitoring heightens when complete tumor ablation involves controlling multiple  sonication procedures. METHODS: To address these challenges, we propose an  artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted USgFUS framework, incorporating an AI  segmentation model with B-mode ultrasound imaging. This method labels the ablated  regions distinguished by the hyperechogenicity effect, potentially bolstering FUS  guidance. We evaluated our proposed method using the Swin-Unet AI architecture,  conducting experiments with a USgFUS setup on chicken breast tissue. RESULTS: Our  results showed a 93% accuracy in identifying ablated areas marked by the  hyperechogenicity effect in B-mode imaging. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that  AI-assisted ultrasound monitoring can significantly improve the precision and  control of FUS treatments, suggesting a crucial advancement toward the  development of more effective FUS treatment strategies.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2260127","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37748776","","","","*Neoplasms; *Ultrasonic Therapy; Artificial Intelligence; Feasibility Studies; High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU); Humans; Ultrasonography; Ultrasonography, Interventional; Ultrasound-Guided-Focused ultrasound (USgFUS) treatment; artificial intelligence (AI); ultrasound B-Mode imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The release of nitric oxide temporarily disrupted tight  junctions in the blood-brain barrier, allowing for the accumulation of the  nanoparticles into brain parenchyma, and the piezoelectrically induced output  current stimulated the release of dopamine by dopaminergic neuron-like cells. In  a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, the ultrasound-responsive nanoparticles  alleviated the symptoms of the disease without causing overt toxicity.
