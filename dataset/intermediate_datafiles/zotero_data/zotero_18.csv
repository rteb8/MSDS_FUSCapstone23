Breech is eight times more likely to occur with UA which may not be diagnosed prior to pregnancy  and may only be found in the third trimester with breech. The objective of the  study is to assess the prevalence of both already known and newly sonographically  diagnosed UA in breech from 36 weeks of gestation and its impact on external  cephalic version (ECV), delivery options and perinatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: We  recruited 469 women with breech at 36 weeks of gestation over a 2-year period at  the Charité University Hospital, Berlin. Ultrasound examination was performed to  rule out UA. Patients with known and newly 'de novo' diagnosed anomalies were  identified and delivery options and perinatal outcomes analyzed. RESULTS: The 'de  novo' diagnosis of UA at 36-37 weeks of pregnancy with breech was found to be  significantly higher compared to the diagnosis prior to pregnancy with 4.5% vs  1.5% (p < 0.001 and odds ratio 4 with 95% confidence interval 2.12-7.69).  Anomalies found included 53.6% bicornis unicollis, 39.3% subseptus, 3.6%  unicornis and 3.6% didelphys. A trial of vaginal breech delivery was successful  in 55.5% of cases when attempted. There were no successful ECVs. CONCLUSION:  Breech is a marker for uterine malformation. Diagnosis of UA with breech can be  up to four times improved with focused ultrasound screening in pregnancy even  from 36 weeks of gestation prior to ECV to identify missed anomalies. Timely  diagnosis aids antenatal care and delivery planning. Importantly, definitive  diagnosis and treatment can be planned postpartum to improve outcomes in future  pregnancies. ECV plays a limited role in selected cases.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","52-58","","","287","","Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

PURPOSE: This study aimed  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UCP in glaucoma patients with high myopia.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we enrolled 36  eyes divided into 2 groups based on axial length: group A (≥26.00 mm) and group B  (<26.00 mm). We collected data about visual acuity, Goldmann applanation  tonometry, biomicroscopy, and visual field before the procedure and at 1, 7, 30,  60, 90, 180, and 365 days after the procedure. RESULTS: Mean IOP significantly  decreased in both groups after treatment ( P <0.001). Mean IOP reduction from  baseline to the last visit was 9.8±6.6 mmHg (38.7%) in group A and 9.6±6.3 mmHg  (34.8%) in group B ( P <0.001). Mean IOP at the last visit was 15.8±4.1 mmHg in  the myopic group and 18.1±5.6 mmHg in the non-myopic one. Regarding the number of  IOP-lowering eyedrops being taken by our patients, statistically significant  differences were found between groups A and B neither at baseline (2.8±0.9 and  2.6±1.0; P =0.568) nor 1 year after the procedure (2.5±1.1 and 2.6±1.1; P  =0.762).

The combination of NSDDSs and therapeutic  ultrasound (TUS), that is, focused ultrasound and low-intensity pulsed  ultrasound, has made significant progress in recent years, opening many  opportunities for cancer treatment. Multiple parameters require tuning and  optimization to develop effective DDSs, such as NSDDSs, in which mathematical  modeling can prove advantageous. In silico computational modeling of  ultrasound-responsive DDS typically involves a complex framework of acoustic  interactions, heat transfer, drug release from nanoparticles, fluid flow, mass  transport, and pharmacodynamic governing equations. Owing to the rapid  development of computational tools, modeling the different phenomena in  multi-scale complex problems involved in drug delivery to tumors has become  possible. In the present study, we present an in-depth review of recent advances  in the mathematical modeling of TUS-mediated DDSs for cancer treatment. A  detailed discussion is also provided on applying these computational models to  improve the clinical translation for applications in cancer treatment.

The prepared LNBs comprised a polyethylene glycol-modified liposome  shell and a perfluoropentane (PFP) core. MiRNA-199a-3p was attached to the  nanocomposite surface via electrostatic adsorption, while RGD peptide  functionalized the LNBs surface for enhanced HCC cell targeting, namely  PFP@miR-RGD-LNBs. The LNBs were spherical with a narrow size distribution. The  gene-loaded LNBs effectively condensed miR-199a-3p and protected it from  enzymatic degradation. Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) promoted a fast  release of miR-199a-3p from the prepared LNBs, thereby enhancing therapeutic  effects. The combined application of PFP@miR-RGD-LNBs and LIFU exhibited a more  potent inhibitory effect on HepG2 cells than the other groups, potentially due to  LIFU promoting rapid and efficient gene release at the target site and increasing  cell membrane permeability. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain  reaction analysis revealed significantly increased mRNA expression levels of key  apoptosis markers (Bad, Bax, Caspase-9 and Caspase-3) in the  PFP@miR-RGD-LNBs + LIFU group compared to other groups.

However, the cellular and molecular consequences of ultrasound  stimulation on neurons remains poorly understood. We previously reported that  ultrasound stimulation induces increases in neuronal excitability that persist  for hours following stimulation in vitro. In the present study we sought to  further elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which ultrasound regulates neuronal  excitability and synaptic function. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of  ultrasound stimulation on voltage-gated ion channel function and synaptic  plasticity. METHODS: Primary rat cortical neurons were exposed to a 40 s, 200 kHz  pulsed ultrasound stimulus or sham-stimulus. Whole-cell patch clamp  electrophysiology, quantitative proteomics and high-resolution confocal  microscopy were employed to determine the effects of ultrasound stimulation on  molecular regulators of neuronal excitability and synaptic function. RESULTS: We  find that ultrasound exposure elicits sustained but reversible increases in  whole-cell potassium currents. In addition, we find that ultrasound exposure  activates synaptic signalling cascades that result in marked increases in  excitatory synaptic transmission. Finally, we demonstrate the requirement of  ionotropic glutamate receptor (AMPAR/NMDAR) activation for ultrasound-induced  modulation of neuronal potassium currents. CONCLUSION: These results suggest  specific patterns of pulsed ultrasound can induce contemporaneous enhancement of  both neuronal excitability and synaptic function, with implications for the  application of FUS in experimental and therapeutic settings. Further study is now  required to deduce the precise molecular mechanisms through which these changes  occur.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","540-552","","2","16","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Management of fibroids in women with otherwise  unexplained infertility worldwide lacks standardized, evidence-based guidelines.  Therefore, a review of guidelines from the Royal Australian and New Zealand  College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, the  Collège National des Gynécologues et Obstétriciens Français, and the American  Society of Reproductive Medicine was conducted. There is agreement among all  guidelines that the effect of fibroids on fertility is related to their position  in the uterus and the alteration of the endometrial cavity. However, whether  surgical intervention (laparotomy, laparoscopy, or hysteroscopy) is required  varies among committees. More specifically, for submucous myomas, all guidelines  agree that surgical intervention is needed. On the other hand, regarding  intramural myomas, there is no consensus on what the approach may be. Novel  treatments such as uterine artery embolization (UAE) and magnetic  resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) should only be used in  clinical trial settings. Nevertheless, all guidelines agree that medical  management of fibroids further delays efforts to conceive and has no role as a  stand-alone treatment of fibroids; though, the use of GnRH analogues  preoperatively can be useful to improve anemia and/or reduce fibroid volume.  There is a need for updated international protocols to be introduced, in order to  help clinicians dealing with fibroids and infertility to better suggest the  optimal treatment.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e50992","","12","15","","Cureus","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023, Michos et al.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38259363  PMCID: PMC10802214","","","","fibroids; guidelines; infertility; leiomyomas; myomectomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although FUS-evoked depolarization has been  studied extensively, the mechanisms underlying FUS-evoked hyperpolarization  (FUSH) have received little attention. In the study described here, we developed  a procedure using FUS to selectively hyperpolarize motor axons in crayfish. As a  previous study had reported that these axons express mechano- and thermosensitive  two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels, we tested the hypothesis that K2P  channels underlie FUSH. METHODS: Intracellular recordings from a motor axon and a  muscle fiber were obtained simultaneously from the crayfish opener neuromuscular  preparation. FUSH was examined while K2P channel activities were modulated by  varying temperature or by K2P channel blockers. RESULTS: FUSH in the axons did  not exhibit a coherent temperature dependence, consistent with predicted K2P  channel behavior, although changes in the resting membrane potential of the same  axons indicated well-behaved K2P channel temperature dependence. The same  conclusion was supported by pharmacological data; namely, FUSH was not suppressed  by K2P channel blockers. Comparison between the FUS-evoked responses recorded in  motor axons and muscle fibers revealed that the latter exhibited very little  FUSH, indicating that the FUSH was specific to the axons. CONCLUSION: It is not  likely that K2P channels are the underlying mechanism for FUSH in motor axons.  Alternative mechanisms such as sonophore and axon-specific potassium channels  were considered. Although the sonophore hypothesis could account for  electrophysiological features of axonal recordings, it is not consistent with the  lack of FUSH in muscle fibers. An axon-specific and mechanosensitive potassium  channel is also a possible explanation.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2527-2536","","12","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

However, a theory-guided mechanoresponsive materials system with  well-defined ultrasound activation has yet to be explored. Here we present the  concept of using porous hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) as toolkits for  focused ultrasound programmably triggered drug activation to control specific  cellular events in the deep brain, through on-demand scission of the  supramolecular interactions. A theoretical model is developed to visualize the  mechanochemical scission and ultrasound mechanics, providing valuable guidelines  for the rational design of mechanoresponsive materials at the molecular level to  achieve programmable and spatiotemporal activation control. To demonstrate the  practicality of this approach, we encapsulate designer drug clozapine N-oxide  (CNO) into the optimal HOF nanoparticles for FUS gated release to activate  engineered G-protein-coupled receptors in the mice and rat ventral tegmental area  (VTA), and hence achieved targeted neural circuits modulation even at depth 9 mm  with a latency of seconds. This work demonstrates the capability of ultrasound to  precisely control molecular interaction and develops ultrasound programmable HOFs  to minimally invasive and spatiotemporally control cellular events, thereby  facilitating the establishment of precise molecular therapeutic possibilities. We  anticipate that this research could serve as a source of inspiration for precise  and non-invasive molecular manipulation techniques, potentially applicable in  programming molecular robots to achieve sophisticated control over cellular  events in deep tissues.","2023-12-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: bioRxiv Pages: 2023.12.08.570721 Publication Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology PMID: 38106007  PMCID: PMC10723392","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous literature has pointed out that  both public and private social platforms can serve as data sources for analysis.  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques  to identify concerns regarding the postoperative quality of life and symptom  burdens in patients with uterine fibroids after focused ultrasound ablation  surgery. METHODS: Screenshots taken from clinician-patient WeChat groups were  converted into free texts using image text recognition technology and used as the  research object of this study. From 408 patients diagnosed with uterine fibroids  in Chongqing Haifu Hospital between 2010 and 2020, we searched for symptom  burdens in over 900,000 words of WeChat group chats. We first built a corpus of  symptoms by manually coding 30% of the WeChat texts and then used regular  expressions in Python to crawl symptom information from the remaining texts based  on this corpus. We compared the results with a manual review (gold standard) of  the same records. Finally, we analyzed the relationship between the population  baseline data and conceptual symptoms; quantitative and qualitative results were  examined. RESULTS: A total of 408 patients with uterine fibroids were included in  the study; 190,000 words of free text were obtained after data cleaning. The mean  age of the patients was 39.94 (SD 6.81) years, and their mean BMI was 22.18 (SD  2.78) kg/m(2). The median reporting times of the 7 major symptoms were 21, 26,  57, 2, 18, 30, and 49 days. Logistic regression models identified preoperative  menstrual duration (odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% CI 5.86-6.37; P=.009), age of  menophania (OR -1.02 , 95% CI 11.96-13.47; P=.03), and the number (OR 2.34, 95%  CI 1.45-1.83; P=.04) and size of fibroids (OR 0.12, 95% CI 2.43-3.51; P=.04) as  significant risk factors for postoperative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Unstructured  free texts from social media platforms extracted by NLP technology can be used  for analysis.

The use of ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles (USMB) can  potentially enhance the effects of radiotherapy through the activation of the  acid sphingomyelinase [ASMase or sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1  (SMPD1)]-ceramide pathway. ASMase knockout (ASMase-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice  bearing fibrosarcoma (MCA/129 tumour line) were treated with 10 Gy or 20 Gy in  five fractions alongside or independently of USMB treatments. The results  indicated that tumour responses to fractionated radiotherapy (fXRT) were enhanced  when fXRT was coupled with USMB as part of the treatment regimen.  Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-treated mice and ASMase-/- mice demonstrated  radioresistance against fXRT alone, whereas only ASMase-/- mice showed  radioresistance against fXRT treatment alone and when combined with USMB. Results  indicated that in WT and S1P-treated cohorts, the use of USMB with fXRT enhanced  the tumour response compared to use of USMB or fXRT alone. Although in WT and  S1P-treated cohorts, there was enhanced vascular disruption, ASMase-/- cohorts  demonstrated no significant vascular disruption, indicating the importance of  ASMase in facilitating vascular changes in response to fXRT and USMB treatment.","2023-06-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","6","16","","Dis Model Mech","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

However, the limited color purity and  tunability, as well as the large sizes of conventional ML materials prevent their  use in an ultrasound-mediated flexible color display. Here, we apply a  biomineral-inspired suppressed dissolution approach to synthesize ML colloids  with bright blue emission under ultrasound and small sizes down to 20 nm. In  addition, we leverage the bandgap engineering strategy of all-inorganic  perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) to achieve wavelength tunability of the  mechanoluminescence of ML colloid/PQD composites. Remarkably, the  ultrasound-activated emission of the ML colloid/PQD composites exhibits a highly  saturated color gamut covering the entire visible spectrum. Based on these  advantages, we assembled a pixel array composed of different ML colloid/PQD  composites in a silicone elastomer and demonstrated the proof-of-concept of a  flexible and wireless multicolor display with each pixel individually addressed  by scanning focused ultrasound.","2023-01-27","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1629-1636","","4","15","","Nanoscale","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36625323  PMCID: PMC10505055","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most preclinical systems developed to perform and monitor BBB opening are  comprised of a separate geometrically focused transducer and passive cavitation  detector (PCD) or imaging array. This study builds upon previous work from our  group developing a single imaging phased array configuration for simultaneous BBB  opening and monitoring called theranostic ultrasound (ThUS), leveraging  ultra-short pulse lengths (USPLs) and a novel rapid alternating steering angles  (RASTA) pulse sequence design for simultaneous bilateral sonications with  target-specific USPL. The RASTA sequence was further employed to evaluate the  impact of USPL on BBB opening volume, power cavitation imaging (PCI) pixel  intensity, BBB closing timeline, drug delivery efficiency, and safety. Methods: A  P4-1 phased array transducer driven by a Verasonics Vantage ultrasound system was  operated using a custom script to run the RASTA sequence which consisted of  interleaved steered, focused transmits and passive imaging. Contrast-enhanced  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed initial opening volume and closure of  the BBB by longitudinal imaging through 72 hours post-BBB opening. For drug  delivery experiments, mice were systemically administered a 70 kDa fluorescent  dextran or adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) for fluorescence microscopy  or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to evaluate ThUS-mediated molecular  therapeutic delivery. Additional brain sections were also H&E-stained to evaluate  histological damage, and IBA1- and GFAP-stained to elucidate the effects of  ThUS-mediated BBB opening on stimulation of key cell types involved in the  neuro-immune response, microglia and astrocytes. Results: The ThUS RASTA sequence  induced distinct BBB openings simultaneously in the same mouse where volume, PCI  pixel intensity, level of dextran delivery, and AAV reporter transgene expression  were correlated with brain hemisphere-specific USPL, consistent with  statistically significant differences between 1.5, 5, and 10-cycle USPL groups.  BBB closure after ThUS required 2-48 hours depending on USPL. The potential for  acute damage and neuro-immune activation increased with USPL, but such observable  damage was nearly reversed 96 hours post-ThUS. Conclusion: ThUS is a versatile  single-array technique which exhibits the potential for investigating a variety  of non-invasive therapeutic delivery applications in the brain.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1180-1197","","3","13","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","eng","© The author(s).","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 36793858  PMCID: PMC9925313","","","","*Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism; *Precision Medicine; Animals; Dextrans/metabolism; Feasibility Studies; Focused ultrasound; Mice; Ultrasonography; cavitation mapping; phased array; short pulses; viral delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we assessed physiologic  responses to FUS administered in multifocal brain sites of persons with  Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: At a tertiary neuroscience institute, eight  participants with AD (mean age 65, 38% F) enrolled in a phase 2 clinical trial  underwent three successive targeted BBB opening procedures at 2 week intervals  using a 220 kHz FUS transducer in combination with systemically administered  microbubbles. In all, 77 treatment sites were evaluated and encompassed  hippocampal, frontal, and parietal brain regions. Post-FUS imaging changes,  including susceptibility effects and spatiotemporal gadolinium-based contrast  agent enhancement patterns, were analyzed using serial 3.0-Tesla MRI. RESULTS:  Post-FUS MRI revealed expected intraparenchymal contrast extravasation due to BBB  opening at all targeted brain sites. Immediately upon BBB opening,  hyperconcentration of intravenously-administered contrast tracer was consistently  observed around intracerebral veins. Following BBB closure, within 24-48 h of FUS  intervention, permeabilization of intraparenchymal veins was observed and  persisted for up to one week. Notably, extraparenchymal meningeal venous  permeabilization and associated CSF effusions were also elicited and persisted up  to 11 days post FUS treatment, prior to complete spontaneous resolution in all  participants. Mild susceptibility effects were detected, however no overt  intracranial hemorrhage or other serious adverse effects occurred in any  participant. CONCLUSIONS: FUS-mediated BBB opening is safely and reproducibly  achieved in multifocal brain regions of persons with AD. Post-FUS tracer  enhancement phenomena suggest the existence of a brain-wide perivenous fluid  efflux pathway in humans and demonstrate reactive physiological changes involving  these conduit spaces in the delayed, subacute phase following BBB disruption. The  delayed reactive venous and perivenous changes are consistent with a dynamic,  zonal exudative response to upstream capillary manipulation. Further preclinical  and clinical investigations of these FUS-related imaging phenomena and of  intracerebral perivenous compartment changes are needed to elucidate physiology  of this pathway as well as biological effects of FUS administered with and  without adjuvant neurotherapeutics.

Focused  ultrasound combined with systemically circulating microbubbles (FUS/MB) is an  emerging modality capable of site-specific molecular delivery temporarily and  noninvasively within a range of appropriate parameters. OBJECTIVE: To investigate  the effect of FUS/MB-enhanced delivery of therapeutics to the motor cortex on the  disease progression by using a transgenic mouse model of ALS. METHODS: Multiple  FUS/MB-enhanced deliveries of Edaravone (Eda) to the motor cortex were performed  on the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of ALS. The motor function of the animals was  evaluated by gait analysis, grip strength and wire hanging tests. Corticospinal  and spinal motor neuronal health, misfolded SOD1 protein and neuroinflammation  after treatments were evaluated by histological examination. RESULTS:  Ultrasound-enhanced delivery of Eda in the targeted motor cortex was achieved by  a two-fold increase without gross tissue damage. Compared with the ALS mice  administered Eda treatments only, the animals given additionally FUS/MB-enhanced  brain delivery of Eda (FUS/MB + Eda) exhibited further improvements in  neuromuscular functions characterized by gait patterns, muscular strength, and  motor coordination along with rescued muscle atrophy. FUS/MB + Eda treatments  conferred remarkable neuroprotection to both upper and lower motor neurons  revealed by normalized neuronal morphology with increasing cell body size and  profoundly alleviated neuroinflammation and misfolded SOD1 protein in the brains  and lumbar spinal cords. CONCLUSION: We report a pilot study that non-invasive  ultrasound-enhanced brain delivery of Eda provides additive amelioration on  disease progression of ALS and suggest that broadening the target from spinal to  cortical network functions using the FUS/MB-enhanced delivery can be a rational  therapeutic strategy of this debilitating disorder.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","628-641","","2","16","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

It remains unknown whether focal VIM lesions by MRgFUS have broader  restorative effects on information flow within the whole-brain network of ET  patients. We applied an information-theoretical approach based on intrinsic  ignition and the concept of transfer entropy (TE) to assess the spatiotemporal  dynamics after VIM-MRgFUS. Eighteen ET patients (mean age 71.44 years) underwent  repeated 3T resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with  Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) assessments one day before (T0) and one  month (T1) and six months (T2) post-MRgFUS, respectively. We observed increased  whole brain ignition-driven mean integration (IDMI) at T1 (p < 0.05), along with  trend increases at T2. Further, constraining to motor network nodes, we  identified significant increases in information-broadcasting (bilateral  supplementary motor area (SMA) and left cerebellar lobule III) and  information-receiving (right precentral gyrus) at T1. Remarkably, increased  information-broadcasting in bilateral SMA was correlated with relative  improvement of the CRST in the treated hand. In addition, causal TE-based  effective connectivity (EC) at T1 showed an increase from right SMA to left  cerebellar lobule crus II and from left cerebellar lobule III to right thalamus.  In conclusion, results suggest a change in information transmission capacity in  ET after MRgFUS and a shift towards a more integrated functional state with  increased levels of global and directional information flow.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","879-888","","3","16","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Studies of the interaction of sound with neurons support the hypothesis that  mechanosensitive ion channels play an important role in ultrasound  neuromodulation. The response of cells other than neurons (e.g., astrocytes,  pericytes and endothelial cells) have not been fully characterized, despite  playing an important role in brain function. METHODS: To address this gap in  knowledge, we examined cultured murine primary cortical neurons, astrocytes,  endothelial cells and pericytes in an in vitro widefield microscopy setup during  application of a 500 ms burst of 250 kHz focused ultrasound over a pressure range  known to elicit neuromodulation. We examined cell membrane health in response to  a range of pulses and used optical calcium indicators in conjunction with  pharmacological antagonists to selectively block different groups of thermo- and  mechanosensitive ion channels known to be responsive to ultrasound. RESULTS: All  cell types experienced an increase in calcium fluorescence in response to  ultrasound. Gadolinium (Gad), 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and ruthenium  red (RR) reduced the percentage of responding neurons and magnitude of response.  The percentage of astrocytes responding was significantly lowered only by Gad,  whereas both 2-APB and Gad decreased the amplitude of the fluorescence response.  2-APB decreased the percentage of responding endothelial cells, whereas only Gad  reduced the magnitude of responses. Pericytes exposed to RR or Gad were less  likely to respond to stimulation. RR had no detectable effect on the magnitude of  the pericyte responses while 2-APB and Gad significantly decreased the  fluorescence intensity, despite not affecting the percentage responding.  CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the role of non-neuronal cells during FUS  neuromodulation.

It has been demonstrated that the neuromodulatory effects can be induced by weak  ultrasound exposure levels (spatial-peak temporal average intensity, I(SPTA) < 10  mW/cm(2)) in vitro. However, fewer studies have examined the use of weak tFUS to  potentially induce long-lasting neuromodulatory responses in vivo. The purpose of  this study was to determine the lower-bound threshold of tFUS stimulation for  inducing neuromodulation in the motor cortex of rats. A total of 94  Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The sonication region aimed at the motor cortex  under weak tFUS exposure (I(SPTA) of 0.338-12.15 mW/cm(2)). The neuromodulatory  effects of tFUS on the motor cortex were evaluated by the changes in motor-evoked  potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In  addition to histology analysis, the in vitro cell culture was used to confirm the  neuromodulatory mechanisms following tFUS stimulation. In the results, the  dose-dependent inhibitory effects of tFUS were found, showing increased  intensities of tFUS suppressed MEPs and lasted for 30 min. Weak tFUS  significantly decreased the expression of excitatory neurons and increased the  expression of inhibitory GABAergic neurons. The PIEZO-1 proteins of GABAergic  neurons were found to involve in the inhibitory neuromodulation. In conclusion,  we show the use of weak ultrasound to induce long-lasting neuromodulatory effects  and explore the potential use of weak ultrasound for future clinical  neuromodulatory applications.","2023-01-30","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","3","24","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36768901  PMCID: PMC9917173","","","","*Motor Cortex/diagnostic imaging/physiology; Animals; Evoked Potentials, Motor; GABAergic Neurons; GABAergic neurons; PIEZO-1 protein; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Ultrasonography; c-fos; in vivo; motor-evoked potentials; neuromodulation; rats; transcranial focused ultrasound; transcranial magnetic stimulation; weak ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Polymer-drug conjugates can be used to deliver drug combinations with a  ratiometric dosing. However, the behaviors and effectiveness of this system have  never been well investigated in GBM models. Here, we report flexible conjugates  of hyaluronic acid (HA) with camptothecin (CPT) and doxorubicin (DOX) delivered  into the brain using focused ultrasound (FUS). In vitro toxicity assays reveal  that DOX-CPT exhibited synergistic action against GBM in a ratio-dependent manner  when delivered as HA conjugates. FUS is employed to improve penetration of  DOX-HA-CPT conjugates into the brain in vivo in a murine GBM model. Small-angle  x-ray scattering characterizations of the conjugates show that the DOX:CPT ratio  affects the polymer chain flexibility. Conjugates with the highest flexibility  yield the highest efficacy in treating mouse GBM in vivo. Our results demonstrate  the association of FUS-enhanced delivery of combination chemotherapy and the  drug-ratio-dependent flexibility of the HA conjugates. Drug ratio in the polymer  nanocomplex may thus be employed as a key factor to modulate FUS drug delivery  efficiency via controlling the polymer flexibility.

MATERIALS  AND METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter trial, 99 women with symptomatic  uterine fibroids were treated using MRgFUS. Pelvic MRI was obtained at baseline  and treatment day. The Uterine Fibroid Symptom-Quality of Life questionnaire was  used to calculate a symptom severity score (SSS) at baseline and 6, 12, 24, and  36 months following treatment. Clinical, imaging, and treatment variables were  correlated with symptom reduction sustained through the 12- and 24-month time  points using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. A novel  parameter, the ratio of non-perfused volume to total fibroid load (NPV/TFL), was  developed to determine association with durable outcomes. RESULTS:  Post-treatment, mean symptom severity decreased at the 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-month  follow-ups (p < 0.001, all time points). In univariable analysis, three variables  predicted treatment success (defined by ≥ 30-point improvement in SSS) sustained  at both the 12-month and 24-month time points: increasing ratio of NPV/TFL  (p = 0.002), decreasing total fibroid load (p = 0.04), and the absence of  T2-weighted Funaki type 2 fibroids (p = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, the  NPV/TFL was the sole predictor of durable clinical success (p = 0.01). Patients  with ratios below 30% had less improvement in SSS and lacked durable clinical  response compared with those between 30-79 (p = 0.03) and ≥ 80% (p = 0.01).  CONCLUSION: Increased non-perfused volume relative to total fibroid volume was  significantly associated with durable reduction of symptoms of abnormal uterine  bleeding and bulk bother. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Patient selection for  sustained clinical benefit should emphasize those with likelihood of achieving  high ablation ratios, as determined by imaging (e.g., device access, Funaki type)  and by considering the total fibroid load, not just the primary symptomatic  fibroid. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trial ID: NCT01285960. KEY POINTS: •  Patient selection/treatment approach associated with durable symptom relief in  MRI-guided focused ultrasound ablation of uterine fibroids remains unclear. • The  ablation ratio, non-perfused volume/total fibroid volume, was positively  associated with sustained symptom relief in both bleeding and bulk bother at 1-  and 2-year follow-ups. • Selecting patients with imaging features that favor a  high ratio of ablation to total fibroid load (including non-targeted fibroids) is  the main factor in predicting durability of symptom relief after uterine fibroid  treatment.","2023-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","7360-7370","","11","33","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Various nursing  education methods need to be developed alongside new treatment methods and their  effects should be clinically verified. Nursing intervention using VR has recently  been attempted. The study comprises a pre- and post-test design with a  non-equivalent control group. We assigned 54 women to experimental (n = 26) and  control (n = 28) groups. The patients were diagnosed with benign uterine tumors  and were treated with HIFU at two women's hospitals in D city. Data collected  from these hospitals were analyzed using descriptive statistics, a pre-test of  homogeneity, independent t-tests, and repeated measures analysis of variance. In  the experimental group, uncertainty (t = 4.26, p < 0.001) and anxiety (t = 4.09,  p < 0.001) were significantly lower compared to the control group. However,  nursing satisfaction was significantly higher in the experimental group than in  the control group (t = -4.50, p < 0.001). The VR education program is an  educational nursing intervention that reduces uncertainty and anxiety and  improves nursing satisfaction among women with uterine tumors treated by HIFU. We  suggest that future nursing research integrates and converges disciplines  according to progressive treatment methods and technological advancements for  patients.","2024-01-15","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e23759","","1","10","","Heliyon","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

The most effective administration route for insulin is  subcutaneous injection because bioavailability for non-injection administration  is low and unstable. However, patients often need a multiple daily insulin  injection regimen to control basal and postprandial blood glucose, which causes  various complications. Controlled pulsatile drug release technology using  ultrasound as an external stimulus source is a very promising method to avoid  multiple injections of insulin. However, most of the drug-loaded microbubbles  used for ultrasound-mediated treatment have a short half-life, which limits their  use in controlled pulsatile drug release. More importantly, how to control  insulin release is still a challenge. In this paper, chitosan poly-acrylic acid  nanobubbles as drug carriers of insulin were prepared to achieve a visually  controlled pulsatile release of insulin triggered by focused ultrasound. The  experimental results in vivo demonstrated that nanobubbles were stable enough to  achieve long-term visualization for 7 days after intramuscular injection in rats.  Under the guidance of ultrasound imaging, it is visible to find the position and  observe the gray values change of nanobubbles. Thus, when triggered by focused  ultrasound, the amount of insulin could be accurately pulsatile released from  nanobubbles. In vivo experiments in rats showed that the visually controlled  pulsatile release of insulin could be achieved for a long time, up to 3  consecutive days. The blood glucose level could be repeatedly reduced by focused  ultrasound irradiation with just one injection. Our research provided a promising  way for visually controlled pulsatile release of insulin, which would  significantly reduce the injection frequency of insulin.","2023-08-25","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","123266","","","643","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023.

A proposed method to improve drug delivery across the BBB is focused  ultrasound (fUS), which delivers ultrasound waves to a targeted location in the  brain and is hypothesized to open the BBB. Furthermore, stem cell-derived  exosomes have been suggested as a possible anti-inflammatory molecule that may  have neural benefits, if able to pass the BBB. In the present study, transcranial  low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), without the use of intravenous  microbubbles, was assessed for both (1) its ability to influence the BBB, as well  as (2) its ability to increase the localization of intravenously administered  small molecules to a specific region in the brain. In vivo rat studies were  conducted with a rodent-customized 2 MHz LIFU probe (peak pressure = 1.5 MPa),  and injection of labeled stem cell-derived exosomes. The results suggested that  LIFU (without microbubbles) did not appear to open the BBB after exposure times  of 20, 40, or 60 min; instead, there appeared to be an increase in transcytosis  of the dextran tracer. Furthermore, the imaging results of the exosome study  showed an increase in exosome localization in the right hippocampus following  60 min of targeted LIFU.","2023-10-18","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","17707","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Forty-three patients with ET performed postural tremor and line-drawing  tasks recorded on video, and the data were analyzed using motion analysis  software. The test-retest and inter-rater reliability, correlations with the CRST  and tremor scores, and pre/post-FUS treatment comparisons were analyzed. The  video motion analysis showed excellent test-retest and inter-rater reliability.  In the postural tremor tasks, video parameter amplitude significantly correlated  with the CRST and tremor scores. Similarly, for the line-drawing task, video  parameter amplitude showed significant correlations with CRST and tremor scores,  effectively addressing the ceiling effect. Regarding post-FUS treatment  improvements, changes in the CRST and tremor scores were significantly associated  with changes in video parameter amplitude. In conclusion, quantitative analysis  of the video motion of ET enables precise evaluation of kinematic characteristics  and effectively resolves the ceiling effect and test-retest variability.

The cavitation  effect induced by FUS is applied for histotripsy, support drug delivery, and the  induction of blood vessel destruction for cancer therapy. Numerous studies report  that cavitation-induced sonoporation could provoke multiple anti-proliferative  effects on cancer cells. Therefore, cavitation alone or in combination with  thermal treatment is of great interest but research in this field is inadequate.  Methods: Human prostate cancer cells (LNCap and PC-3) were exposed to 40 s  cavitation using a FUS system, followed by water bath hyperthermia (HT). The  clonogenic assay, WST-1 assay, and Transwell(®) invasion assay, respectively,  were used to assess cancer cell clonogenic survival, metabolic activity, and  invasion potential. Fluorescence microscopy using propidium iodide (PI) as a  probe of cell membrane integrity was used to identify sonoporation. The H2A.X  assay and Nicoletti test were conducted in the mechanism investigation to detect  DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and cell cycle arrest. Immunofluorescence  microscopy and flow cytometry were performed to determine the distribution and  expression of 5α-reductase (SRD5A). Results: Short FUS shots with cavitation  (FUS-Cav) in combination with HT resulted in, respectively, a 2.2, 2.3, and  2.8-fold decrease (LNCap) and a 2.0, 1.5, and 1.6-fold decrease (PC-3) in the  clonogenic survival, cell invasiveness and metabolic activity of prostate cancer  cells when compared to HT alone. FUS-Cav immediately induced sonoporation in  61.7% of LNCap cells, and the combination treatment led to a 1.4 (LNCap) and  1.6-fold (PC-3) increase in the number of DSBs compared to HT alone. Meanwhile,  the combination therapy resulted in 26.68% of LNCap and 31.70% of PC-3 with cell  cycle arrest in the Sub-G1 phase and 35.37% of PC-3 with cell cycle arrest in the  G2/M phase. Additionally, the treatment of FUS-Cav combined with HT block the  androgen receptor (AR) signal pathway by reducing the relative Type I  5α-reductase (SRD5A1) level to 38.28 ± 3.76% in LNCap cells, and decreasing the  relative Type III 5α-reductase 3 (SRD5A3) level to 22.87 ± 4.88% in PC-3 cells,  in contrast, the relative SRD5A level in untreated groups was set to 100%.  Conclusion: FUS-induced cavitation increases the effects of HT by interrupting  cancer cell membranes, inducing the DSBs and cell cycle arrest, and blocking the  AR signal pathway of the prostate cancer cells, with the potential to be a  promising adjuvant therapy in prostate cancer treatment.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1122758","","","14","","Front Genet","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Hu, Zhang, Melzer and Landgraf.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37152995  PMCID: PMC10154534","","","","cavitation; combination; focused ultrasound; hyperthermia; mechanisms; prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This treatment method significantly alleviates  disease-related symptoms and reduces pancreatic tumor volume. However, the  current body of evidence is constrained by a lack of randomized controlled  trials. The utilization of USgHIFU is primarily indicated for patients with  unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic pancreatic cancer, particularly  those experiencing symptoms due to a locally advanced primary tumor.Methods: This  collaborative consensus paper, involving European and Chinese HIFU centers  treating pancreatic cancer, delineates criteria for patient selection, focusing  on those most likely to benefit from USgHIFU treatment. Consideration is given to  endpoints encompassing symptom alleviation, local response rates, other  oncological outcomes, as well as overall and progression-free survival.  Additionally, this paper defines relevant contraindications, side effects, and  complications associated with USgHIFU. The publication also explores the  feasibility and role of USgHIFU within the context of palliative care, including  standard systemic chemotherapy.Results: The non-invasive local treatment of  advanced pancreatic cancer using HIFU should be regarded as an adjunctive option  alongside systemic chemotherapy or best supportive care for managing this  aggressive disease. Based on the ability of USgHIFU therapy to mitigate pain and  reduce primary tumor volume, it should be considered as a complementary therapy  for symptomatic patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer and as a potential  means of tumor debulking. The underutilized yet promising USgHIFU exhibits the  potential to enhance patients' quality of life by alleviating cancer-related  pain. Experts in the field should evaluate this treatment option be evaluated by  experts in this field, with this consensus paper potentially serving as a guiding  resource for the medical community.Conclusions: US-guided HIFU for advanced  pancreatic cancer addresses treatment goals, available options, success rates,  and limitations. As a non-invasive, effective local therapy, complementary to  chemotherapy and best supportive care, it plays a pivotal role in pain relief,  reducing of tumor volume, and potentially improving survival rates.","2024","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2295812","","1","41","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38159562","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/therapy; China; Consensus; Humans; Pain/etiology; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome; US-guided HIFU; expert consensus; pancreatic cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mean FFV without neurosurgical intervention was  18.3%, SD = 7.8 and with neurosurgical intervention was 6.3%, SD = 3.0 (t (70)  =8.7, p < 0.001). Mean FFV decreased in the FUS cohort from 22.0%, SD = 7.1  pre-ablation to 6.7%, SD = 2.4 post-ablation (t (40) = 7.7, p < 0.001). Mean FFV  also decreased in the DBS cohort from 15.7%, SD = 7.0 to 6.0%, SD = 3.3 when  stimulation was turned on (t (28)=5.7 p < 0.001). In the FUS group, mean VTR  decreased from 4.0 to 1.4 post-ablation (Z = 7.8, p < 0.001). In the DBS group,  mean VTR decreased from 3.3 to 2.1 with stimulation (Z = 4.1, p < 0.001).  CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical interventions for ET (bilateral DBS and unilateral FUS)  demonstrate acoustic and perceptual benefits for VT.

In cystic or predominantly cystic lesions  instillation therapy (ethanol/polidocanol ablation) has yielded good results.  Novel thermal ablation techniques, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA),  microwave ablation (MWA), laser ablation (LA) and high intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU), induce irreversible cellular effects by locally applying  temperatures ≥ 60 °C to the targeted thyroid region. Lesions causing local  symptoms or focal hyperfunctionality can thus be selectively treated under  continuous sonographic monitoring. While a considerable body of evidence supports  the efficacy and safety of various local ablative techniques, future challenges  lie in initiating comparative prospective trials and in standardizing clinical  practice, training and continuous quality assessment on a regional and  superregional level. In the future, it shall be indicated to include local  ablative techniques - so far not known to all patients in Germany - into the  informed decision-making process as a suitable alternative or supplement to  existing therapies.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","916-927","","12","102","","Laryngorhinootologie","","","","","","","","ger","Thieme.

Treatments such as chemotherapy and  radiation therapy have shown overall improved survival benefits, albeit limited.  Histotripsy is a noninvasive, non-ionizing, and non-thermal focused ultrasound  ablation modality that has shown efficacy in treating hepatic tumors and other  malignancies. In this novel study, we investigate histotripsy for noninvasive  pancreas ablation in a pig model. In two studies, histotripsy was applied to the  healthy pancreas in 11 pigs using a custom 32-element, 500 kHz histotripsy  transducer attached to a clinical histotripsy system, with treatments guided by  real-time ultrasound imaging. A pilot study was conducted in 3 fasted pigs with  histotripsy applied at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 500 Hz. Results  showed no pancreas visualization on coaxial ultrasound imaging due to overlying  intestinal gas, resulting in off-target injury and no pancreas damage. To  minimize gas, a second group of pigs (n = 8) were fed a custard diet containing  simethicone and bisacodyl. Pigs were euthanized immediately (n = 4) or survived  for 1 week (n = 4) post-treatment. Damage to the pancreas and surrounding tissue  was characterized using gross morphology, histological analysis, and CT imaging.  Results showed histotripsy bubble clouds were generated inside pancreases that  were visually maintained on coaxial ultrasound (n = 4), with 2 pigs exhibiting  off-target damage. For chronic animals, results showed the treatments were  well-tolerated with no complication signs or changes in blood markers. This study  provides initial evidence suggesting histotripsy's potential for noninvasive  pancreas ablation and warrants further evaluation in more comprehensive studies.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2247187","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37643768  PMCID: PMC10839746","","","","*Pancreas/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Pancreatic Neoplasms; Animals; Feasibility Studies; Pancreas; Pilot Projects; Swine; Ultrasonography, Interventional; focused ultrasound; histotripsy; large animal model; pancreatic cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

She  was closely monitored during the pregnancy and the antenatal course was  uneventful. At the gestational age of 38 weeks and 2 days, an emergency lower  segment cesarean section was performed because of inexplainable abdominal pain.  After delivery of the fetus, a 2 × 2 cm serous membrane rupture was observed in  the HIFU treatment area.

The Zener viscoelastic model and Keller-Miksis bubble  equation, which have been used for analyses of single or few bubbles in  viscoelastic liquid, are used to model the liquid containing multiple bubbles.  From the theoretical analysis based on the perturbation expansion with the  multiple-scales method, the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov (KZK) equation, which  has been used as a mathematical model of weakly nonlinear propagation in single  phase liquid, is extended to viscoelastic liquid containing multiple bubbles. The  results show that liquid elasticity decreases the magnitudes of the nonlinearity,  dissipation, and dispersion of ultrasound and increases the phase velocity of the  ultrasound and linear natural frequency of the bubble oscillation. From the  numerical calculation of resultant KZK equation, the spatial distribution of the  liquid pressure fluctuation for the focused ultrasound is obtained for cases in  which the liquid is water or liver tissue. In addition, frequency analysis is  carried out using the fast Fourier transform, and the generation of higher  harmonic components is compared for water and liver tissue. The elasticity  suppresses the generation of higher harmonic components and promotes the remnant  of the fundamental frequency components. This indicates that the elasticity of  liquid suppresses shock wave formation in practical applications.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","106455","","","97","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Given that the flexible shape of the Gamma mixture model (GΓMM)  fits the complex statistical distribution of samples, a method combining the GΓMM  and Bayes framework is constructed for the classification of samples to obtain  the segmentation result. An appropriate normalization range and parameters can be  used to rapidly obtain a good performance of GΓMM segmentation. The performance  values of the proposed method under four metrics (Dice score: 85%, Jaccard  coefficient: 75%, recall: 86%, and accuracy: 96%) are better than those of  conventional approaches including Otsu and Region growing. Furthermore, the  statistical result of sample intensity indicates that the finding of the GΓMM is  similar to that obtained by the manual method. These results indicate the  stability and reliability of the GΓMM combined with the Bayes framework for the  segmentation of HIFU lesions in ultrasound images.

We have performed US  histotripsy in viable perfused ex vivo porcine livers as a step in the  development of a novel approach to hepatocyte cell transplantation.

Five whole porcine livers were retrieved  fresh from the abattoir using human transplant retrieval and cold static  preservation techniques and were then perfused using an organ preservation  circuit. Whilst under perfusion, histotripsy was performed to randomly selected  sites on the live. Fifteen lesional sites were formalin-fixed and  paraffin-embedded. Sections were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and  picro-Sirius red, and they were also stained for reticulin. Additionally, two  lesion sites were used for 3D reconstruction. The core of the typical lesion  consisted of eosinophilic material associated with reticulin loss, collagen  damage including loss of birefringence to fibrous septa, and perilesional portal  tracts, including large portal vein branches, but intact peri-lesional hepatic  plates. The 3D reconstruction of two histotripsy sites was successful and  confirmed the feasibility of this approach to investigate the effects of  histotripsy on tissue in detail.","2023-02-21","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","3","10","","Bioengineering (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36978669  PMCID: PMC10044833","","","","birefringence; boiling histotripsy; liver; necrosis; pig liver; whole organ perfusion system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a novel single-transmit bipolar sequence with  minimum-peak-sidelobe (MPS) level is developed not only to restore the image  quality of US monitoring but also remove acoustic interference from simultaneous  HIFU transmission. The proposed MPS code is designed with an equal number of  positive and negative bits and the bit duration should be an integer multiple of  the period of the HIFU waveform. In addition, different permutations of code  sequence are searched in order to obtain the optimal encoding. The received  imaging echo is firstly decoded by matched filtering to cancel HIFU interference  and to enhance the echo magnitude of US monitoring. Then, Wiener filtering is  applied as the second-stage pulse compression to improve the final image quality.  Simulations and phantom experiments are performed to compare the single-transmit  MPS decoding with conventional two-transmit methods such as pulse-inversion  subtraction (PIS) and Golay decoding for their performance in simultaneous US  monitoring of HIFU treatment. Results show that the MPS decoding effectively  removes HIFU interference even in the presence of tissue motion. The image  quality of PIS and Golay decoding, on the other hand, is compromised by the  uncancelled HIFU components due to tissue motion. Simultaneous US monitoring of  tissue ablation using the proposed MPS decoding has also demonstrated to be  feasible in ex-vivo experiments. Compared to the notch filtering that also allows  single-transmit HIFU elimination, the MPS decoding is preferrable because it does  not suffer from the tradeoff between residual HIFU and speckle deterioration in  US monitoring images.","2023-12-15","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","107224","","","138","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Neuromodulation studies have shown that FUS can excite or inhibit neuronal  activity, demonstrating its tremendous potential to improve the outcome of  neurological diseases. Recent evidence has also shed light on the emerging  promise that FUS has, with and without the use of intravenously injected  microbubbles, in modulating the blood-brain barrier and the immune cells of the  brain. As the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, microglia are  at the forefront of the brain's maintenance and immune defense. Notably,  microglia are highly dynamic and continuously survey the brain parenchyma by  extending and retracting their processes. This surveillance activity aids  microglia in performing key physiological functions required for brain activity  and plasticity. In response to stressors, microglia rapidly alter their cellular  and molecular profile to help facilitate a return to homeostasis. While the  underlying mechanisms by which both FUS and FUS + microbubbles modify microglial  structure and function remain largely unknown, several studies in adult mice have  reported changes in the expression of the microglia/macrophage marker ionized  calcium binding adaptor molecule 1, and in their phagocytosis, notably of protein  aggregates, such as amyloid beta. In this review, we discuss the demonstrated and  putative biological effects of FUS and FUS + microbubbles in modulating  microglial activities, with an emphasis on the key cellular and molecular changes  observed in vitro and in vivo across models of brain health and disease.  Understanding how this innovative technology can modulate microglia paves the way  for future therapeutic strategies aimed to promote beneficial physiological  microglial roles, and prevent or treat maladaptive responses.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1290628","","","17","","Front Cell Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Grewal, Gonçalves de Andrade, Kofoed, Matthews, Aubert, Tremblay and Morse.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38164436  PMCID: PMC10757935","","","","blood-brain barrier; focused ultrasound; functional effects; glia; microglia; modulation; neurodegeneration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
