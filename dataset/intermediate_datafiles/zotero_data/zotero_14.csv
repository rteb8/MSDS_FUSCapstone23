Histotripsy is an emerging tumor ablation modality, and it is essential for the  clinical translation of histotripsy to gain knowledge about the outcome of  nonablated tumor cells that could remain postablation. The objective of this  study was to characterize the cell death genetic signature and proliferation  response of canine OS cells post a near complete histotripsy ablation (96% ± 1.5)  and to evaluate genetic cell death signatures associated with histotripsy  ablation and OS in vivo. METHODS: In the current study, we ablated three canine  OS cell lines with a histotripsy dose that resulted in near complete ablation to  allow for a viable tumor cell population for downstream analyses. To assess the  in vivo cell death genetic signature, we characterized cell death genetic  signature in histotripsy-ablated canine OS tumors collected 24-h postablation.  RESULTS: Differential gene expression changes observed in the 4% viable D17 and  D418 cells, and histotripsy-ablated OS tumor samples, but not in Abrams cells,  were associated with immunogenic cell death (ICD). The 4% viable OS cells  demonstrated significantly reduced proliferation, compared to control OS cells,  in vitro. CONCLUSION: Histotripsy ablation of OS cell lines leads to direct and  potentially indirect cell death as evident by, reduced proliferation in remaining  viable OS cells and cell death genetic signatures suggestive of ICD both in vitro  and in vivo.","2023","2024-03-18 17:30:15","2024-03-18T17:30:15Z","","2279027","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38151477  PMCID: PMC10764077","","","","*Bone Neoplasms/genetics; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Osteosarcoma/genetics; Animals; Cell Death; Dogs; Focused ultrasound; Humans; bone cancer; cell death; comparative oncology; tumor ablation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, there are no reports investigating histotripsy for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma (STS). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the in vivo feasibility of ablating STS with histotripsy and to characterize the impact of partial histotripsy ablation on the acute immunologic response in canine patients with spontaneous STS. METHODS: A custom 500 kHz histotripsy system was used to treat ten dogs with naturally occurring STS. Four to six days after histotripsy, tumors were surgically resected. Safety was determined by monitoring vital signs during treatment and post-treatment physical examinations, routine lab work, and owners' reports. Ablation was characterized using radiologic and histopathologic analyses. Systemic immunological impact was evaluated by measuring changes in cytokine concentrations, and tumor microenvironment changes were evaluated by characterizing changes in infiltration with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) using multiplex immunohistochemistry and differential gene expression. RESULTS: Results showed histotripsy ablation was achievable and well-tolerated in all ten dogs. Immunological results showed histotripsy induced pro-inflammatory changes in the tumor microenvironment. Conclusion & Significance: Overall, this study demonstrates histotripsy's potential as a precise, non-invasive treatment for STS.","2022-08-25","2024-03-18 17:29:59","2024-03-18T17:29:59Z","","","","","PP","","IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36006886","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Sarcoma/diagnostic imaging/therapy; Animals; Dogs; Tumor Microenvironment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past 2 decades, the number of scientific  publications on SDT has increased rapidly. However, there is still a lack of one  comprehensive report that summarizes the global research trends and knowledge  landscapes in the field of SDT in detail. Thus, we performed a bibliometric  analysis on SDT from 2000 to 2021 to track the current hotspots and highlight  future directions. Methods: We collected publications on SDT research from the  Web of Science Core Collection database. The annual number of publications and  citations, major contributors, popular journals, international collaborations,  co-cited references and co-occurrence keywords were analyzed and visualized with  CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and R-bibliometrix. Results: A total of 701 publications  were included. The annual publication output increased from 5 in 2000 to 175 in  2021, and the average growth rate was 18.4%. China was the most productive  country with 463 documents (66.05%), and Harbin Medical University was the most  prolific institution (N = 73). Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology published the  most papers related to SDT. Materials Science, and Chemistry were the research  areas receiving the most interest. All the keywords were divided into four  different clusters including studies on mechanisms, studies on drug delivery and  nanoparticles, studies on cancer therapy, as well as studies on ultrasound and  sonosensitizers. In addition to nanomaterials-related studies including  nanoparticles, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, nanosheets, liposomes,  microbubble and TiO(2) nanoparticle, the following research directions such as  immunogenic cell death, metal-organic framework, photothermal therapy, hypoxia,  tumor microenvironment, chemodynamic therapy, combination therapy, tumor  resistance, intensity focused ultrasound, drug delivery, and Staphylococcus  aureus also deserve further attention and may continue to explode in the future.  Conclusion: SDT has a bright future in the field of cancer treatment, and  nanomaterials have increasingly influenced the SDT field with the development of  nano-technology. Overall, this comprehensive bibliometric study was the first  attempt to analyze the field of SDT, which could provide valuable references for  later researchers to better understand the global research trends, hotspots and  frontiers in this domain.","2022","2024-03-06 17:12:06","2024-03-06T17:12:06Z","","1048211","","","13","","Front Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Wu, Cheng, Shen, Lu, Wang, Wang, Wang, Yang, Sun, Guo and Wu.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36699067  PMCID: PMC9868186","","","","bibliometric; cancer; data visualization; nanoparticle; sonodynamic therapy; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, ultrasound switchable fluorescence (USF) imaging has  been explored with improved imaging sensitivity and spatial resolution in  centimeter-deep tissues. This study achieved size control of polymer-based and  indocyanine green (ICG) encapsulated USF contrast agents, capable of accumulating  at the tumor after intravenous injections. These nanoprobes varied in size from  58 nm to 321 nm. The bioimaging profiles demonstrated that the proposed  nanoparticles can efficiently eliminate the background light from normal tissue  and show a tumor-specific fluorescence enhancement in the BxPC-3 tumor-bearing  mice models possibly via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. In vivo  tumor USF imaging further proved that these nanoprobes can effectively be  switched 'ON' with enhanced fluorescence in response to a focused ultrasound  stimulation in the tumor microenvironment, contributing to the high-resolution  USF images. Therefore, our findings suggest that ICG-encapsulated nanoparticles  are good candidates for USF imaging of tumors in living animals, indicating their  great potential in optical tumor imaging in deep tissue.","2023-01","2024-03-06 17:06:15","2024-03-06T17:06:15Z","","1009-1020","","1","16","","Nano Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: China PMID: 38098888  PMCID: PMC10720766","","","","deep tissue near-infrared (NIR) imaging; high resolution; in vivo tumor imaging; indocyanine green (ICG); ultrasound-switchable fluorescence imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: This pilot prospective observational study included patients  scheduled for emergency, non-cardiac surgery. The treating team completed a  diagnosis and management plan before and after focused cardiac and lung  ultrasound, which was performed by a junior doctor. Changes to diagnosis and  management after ultrasound were recorded. Ultrasound images were assessed for  image and diagnostic interpretation by an independent expert. RESULTS: There was  a total of 57 patients at age 77 ± 8 years. Cardiopulmonary pathology was  suspected after clinical assessment in 28% vs. 72% after ultrasound (including  abnormal haemodynamic state in 61%, valvular lesions in 32%, acute pulmonary  oedema/interstitial syndrome in 9% and bilateral pleural effusions in 2%).

The changes were in fluid  therapy in 30%, cardiology consultation in 7%, formal in- or out-patient,  transthoracic echocardiography in 11% and 30% respectively. DISCUSSION: The  impact of pre-operative focused cardiac and lung ultrasound on diagnosis and  management of patients on the hospital ward before emergency non-cardiac surgery  by a junior doctor was comparable to previous studies of anaesthetists  experienced in focused ultrasound. However, the ability to recognise when image  quality is insufficient for diagnosis is an important consideration for novice  sonographers.

Thyroid−related HS represents an unusual entity  underling thyroid nodules/goiter/cancer−HS (T-HS), and post-thyroidectomy HS  (Tx-HS). We aim to overview Tx-HS. This is a narrative review. We revised PubMed  published, full-length, English papers from inception to November 2022.  Additionally, we introduced data on post-thyroidectomy lymphocele/chylous leakage  (Tx-L), and introduced a new pediatric case with both Tx-HS and Tx-L. Tx-HS: the  level of statistical evidence varies from isolated case reports, studies  analyzing the large panel of post-thyroidectomy complications reporting HS among  the rarest side effects (as opposite to hypocalcemia), or different series of  patients with HS due to various disorders, including T-HS/Tx-HS. Tx-HS is related  to benign or malignant thyroid conditions, regardless the type of surgery. A  pre-operatory rate of T-HS of 0.14%; a post-operatory rate of Tx-HS between 0.03%  and 5% (mostly, 0.2%) are identified; a possible higher risk on endoscopic rather  than open procedure is described. Incomplete HS forms, and pediatric onset are  identified, too; the earliest identification is after 2 h since intervention. A  progressive remission is expected in most cases within the first 2−6 months to  one year. The management is mostly conservative; some used glucocorticoids and  neurotrophic agents. One major pitfall is an additional contributor factor like a  local compression due to post-operatory collections (hematoma, cysts, fistula,  Tx-L) and their correction improves the outcome. The prognostic probably depends  on the severity of cervical sympathetic chain (CSC) lesions: indirect, mild  injury due to local compressive masses, intra-operatory damage of CSC like  ischemia and stretching of CSC by the retractor associate HS recovery, while CSC  section is irreversible. Other iatrogenic contributors to HS are: intra-operatory  manipulation of parathyroid glands, thyroid microwave/radiofrequency ablation,  and high-intensity focused ultrasound, and percutaneous ethanol injection into  thyroid nodules. Tx-L, rarely reported (mostly <0.5%, except for a ratio of 8.3%  in one study), correlates with extended surgery, especially lateral/central neck  dissection, and the presence of congenitally—aberrant lymphatic duct; it is,  also, described after endoscopic procedures and chest-breast approach; it starts  within days after surgery. Typically low-fat diet (even fasting and parental  nutrition) and tube drainage are useful (as part of conservative management);  some used octreotide, local sealing solutions like hypertonic glucose, Viscum  album extract, n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. Re-intervention is required in severe  cases due to the risk of lymphorrhoea and chylothorax. Early identification of  Tx-HS and Tx-L improves the outcome. Some iatrogenic complications are inevitable  and a multifactorial model of prediction is still required, also taking into  consideration standardized operatory procedures, skillful intra-operatory  manipulation, and close post-operatory follow-up of the patients, especially  during modern era when thyroid surgery registered a massive progress allowing an  early discharge of the patients.","2023-01-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","2","12","","J Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36675400  PMCID: PMC9865845","","","","Horner syndrome; chylous leakage; endocrine; eye; lymphocele; medullary thyroid cancer; thyroid; thyroid surgery; thyroidectomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim was to introduce a safer,  cost-effective, and efficient alternative to existing treatments, especially  beneficial for inaccessible brain tumor sites and resource-constrained medical  facilities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leveraging post-1990s MR technology  advancements, we employed the non-invasive HITU technique, akin to high-intensity  focused ultrasound. This method directs acoustic energy to tissues, primarily  inducing coagulation necrosis by absorbing energy and elevating tissue  temperatures. Glial tumor cells were subjected to HITU to assess its effects.  RESULTS: Upon applying HITU to glial tumor cells, significant alterations in  cellular structural integrity were evident. The main action of HITU was the  absorption of acoustic energy, leading to a notable temperature rise and  coagulation necrosis. Flow cytometry indicated significant cellular changes  post-HITU. ANOVA and t-test analyses showed a significant relationship between  HITU application and time (p<0.05). The Shapiro-Wilk test revealed non-normal  data distribution (p<0.05), leading to the use of nonparametric methods. The  t-test results after HITU displayed significant differences (p<0.05) in cell  counts and fluorescence intensity between control and treated groups. This result  was consistent across multiple tests, indicating the reliability of the method in  causing cellular damage to the tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our laboratory analyses  offer compelling evidence that HITU is not merely feasible but is also a  promising non-invasive approach in the treatment paradigm of brain tumors.  Standing distinctively apart from radiotherapy, HITU averts early, or late  complications commonly associated with the former. While the path ahead mandates  comprehensive research to ascertain its clinical utility, preliminary indications  firmly posit HITU as a groundbreaking prospect in the management of brain tumors.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","11859-11875","","24","27","","Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 38164850","","","","*Brain Neoplasms/therapy; *Glioma; *Ultrasonic Therapy; Cell Culture Techniques; Humans; Necrosis; Reproducibility of Results","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our preregistered double-blind within-subjects study (N = 152) utilized  TUS targeting the right prefrontal cortex, which, in earlier work, was found to  positively enhance self-reported global mood, decrease negative states of  self-reported emotional conflict (anxiety/worrying), and modulate related  midfrontal functional magnetic resonance imaging activity in affect regulation  brain networks. To further explore TUS effects on objective physiological and  behavioral variables, we used a virtual T-maze task that has been established in  prior studies to measure motivational conflicts regarding whether participants  execute approach versus withdrawal behavior (with free-choice responses via  continuous joystick movements) while allowing to record related  electroencephalographic data such as midfrontal theta activity (MFT). MFT, a  reliable marker of conflict representation on a neuronal level, was of particular  interest to us since it has repeatedly been shown to explain related behavior,  with relatively low MFT typically preceding approach-like risky behavior and  relatively high MFT typically preceding withdrawal-like risk aversion. Our  central hypothesis is that TUS decreases MFT in T-maze conflict situations and  thereby increases approach and reduces withdrawal. Results indicate that TUS led  to significant MFT decreases, which significantly explained increases in approach  behavior and decreases in withdrawal behavior. This study expands TUS evidence on  a physiological and behavioral level with a large sample size of human subjects,  suggesting the promise of further research based on this distinct  TUS-MFT-behavior link to influence conflict monitoring and its behavioral  consequences. Ultimately, this can serve as a foundation for future clinical work  to establish TUS interventions for emotional and motivational mental health.","2023-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1278-1288","","5","16","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Obtaining the boundary heat flux into the  three-layered skin tissue is a necessary condition to realize the measurement of  tissue heat distribution. Considering the complexity of multiple boundary heat  fluxes in spatio-temporal distribution, this study proposes an inversion scheme  to predict the spatio-temporal distribution of multiple boundary heat fluxes into  the three-layered skin tissue. In the inversion scheme, a multivariable  prediction model is established to solve the spatio-temporal coupling problem  between the inversed boundary heat flux and measurement temperature information.  Furthermore, based on the dependence between the predicted temperature and  inversed boundary heat flux, the inversion system is constructed to realize the  simultaneous optimization inversion of multiple boundary heat fluxes in  spatio-temporal distribution. To examine the feasibility and effectiveness of  inversion scheme, numerical experiments are carried out to discuss the influence  of future time steps and measurement errors on the inversion results of boundary  heat flux. In addition, the transient temperature field of three-layered skin  tissue is reconstructed by inversed boundary heat flux, which could provide an  economical, effective, and non-invasive solution for the measurement of thermal  field of three-layered skin tissue during hyperthermia.","2023-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","103515","","","114","","J Therm Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Various methods for cancer treatment are being developed, and among them, magnetically driven  microrobots capable of minimally invasive surgery and accurate targeting are in  the spotlight. However, existing medical magnetically manipulated microrobots  contain magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which can cause toxicity to normal cells  after the delivery of therapeutic drugs. In addition, there is a limitation in  that cancer cells become resistant to the drug by mainly delivering only one  drug, thereby reducing the treatment efficiency. In this paper, to overcome these  limitations, we propose a microrobot that can separate/retrieve MNPs after  precise targeting of the microrobot and can sequentially deliver dual drugs  (gemcitabine (GEM) and doxorubicin (DOX)). First, after the proposed microrobot  targeting, MNPs attached to the microrobot surface can be separated from the  microrobot using focused ultrasound (FUS) and retrieved through an external  magnetic field. Second, the active release of the first conjugated drug GEM to  the surface of the microrobot is possible using near-infrared (NIR), and as the  microrobot slowly decomposes over time, the release of the second encapsulated  DOX is possible. Therefore, it is possible to increase the cancer cell treatment  efficiency with sequential dual drugs in the microrobot. We performed basic  experiments on the targeting of the proposed magnetically manipulated microrobot,  separation/retrieval of MNPs, and the sequential dual-drug release and validated  the performances of the microrobot through in vitro experiments using the  EMA/FUS/NIR integrated system. As a result, the proposed microrobot is expected  to be used as one of the methods to improve cancer cell treatment efficiency by  improving the limitations of existing microrobots in cancer cell treatment.","2023-06-14","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","27471-27485","","23","15","","ACS Appl Mater Interfaces","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37212791","","","","*Drug Delivery Systems/methods; *Magnetite Nanoparticles; Doxorubicin/pharmacology; Drug Liberation; Magnetic Fields; dual-drug delivery microrobot; integrated system; magnetic nanoparticle retrieval; sequential dual-drug release; tumor therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This GL has been developed following the methods described  in the Manual of the National Guideline System. For each question, the panel  appointed by Associazione Medici Endocrinology (AME) identified potentially  relevant outcomes, which were then rated for their impact on therapeutic choices.  Only outcomes classified as ""critical"" and ""important"" were considered in the  systematic review of evidence and only those classified as ""critical"" were  considered in the formulation of recommendations. RESULTS: The present GL  contains recommendations about the respective roles of surgery and minimally  invasive treatments for the management of benign symptomatic thyroid nodules. We  suggest hemithyroidectomy plus isthmectomy as the first-choice surgical  treatment, provided that clinically significant disease is not present in the  contralateral thyroid lobe. Total thyroidectomy should be considered for patients  with clinically significant disease in the contralateral thyroid lobe. We suggest  considering thermo-ablation as an alternative option to surgery for patients with  a symptomatic, solid, benign, single, or dominant thyroid nodule. These  recommendations apply to outpatients, either in primary care or when referred to  specialists. CONCLUSION: The present GL is directed to endocrinologists,  surgeons, and interventional radiologists working in hospitals, in territorial  services, or private practice, general practitioners, and patients. The available  data suggest that the implementation of this GL recommendations will result in  the progressive reduction of surgical procedures for benign thyroid nodular  disease, with a decreased number of admissions to surgical departments for  non-malignant conditions and more rapid access to patients with thyroid cancer.  Importantly, a reduction of indirect costs due to long-term replacement therapy  and the management of surgical complications may also be speculated.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","876-885","","6","23","","Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 36722479  PMCID: PMC10245801","","","","*Thyroid Neoplasms/pathology; *Thyroid Nodule/diagnosis/surgery; Adult; HIFU; Humans; Italy/epidemiology; Thyroid nodule; Thyroidectomy; Treatment Outcome; ablation; ethanol injection; hemi-thyroidectomy; laser; microwave; radiofrequency; thermo-ablation; thyroidectomy; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultrasound imaging of inhomogeneous media inherently suffers from variations in  ultrasonic speed between tissue. The characteristics of aberrations are unique to  each patient due to tissue morphology. This study proposes a new phase aberration  correction method based on the Fourier transform and leveraging of the synthetic  aperture mode. The proposed method enables correction after the emission and  reception of ultrasonic wave, allowing for the estimation of aberration profiles  for different parts of the sonogram. To demonstrate the method's performance,  this study included the conducting of experiments using a commercially available  quality control phantom, an ex-vivo temporal human bone, and specially designed  distortion layers. At a frequency of 2 MHz, the experiments demonstrated an  increase of two-and-three-quarters in echo signal intensity and a decrease of  nearly two-fold in the width of the angular distribution compared to the  pre-correction state. However, it is important to note that the implementation of  the method has a limitation, as it requires an aperture synthesis mode and access  to raw RF data, which restricts use in common scanners. To ensure the  reproducibility of the results, this paper provides public access to an in-house  C +  + code for aberration correction following the proposed method, as well as  the dataset used in this study.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1765-1778","","4","46","","Phys Eng Sci Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Non-invasive brain stimulation  (NIBS) approaches such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial  electrical stimulation (tES) are considered as potential therapeutic options to  enhance functional reorganization and augment the effects of neurorehabilitation.  However, non-invasive electrical and magnetic stimulation paradigms are limited  by their depth focality trade-off function that does not allow to target deep key  brain structures critically important for recovery processes. Transcranial  ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an emerging approach for non-invasive deep brain  neuromodulation. Using non-ionizing, ultrasonic waves with millimeter-accuracy  spatial resolution, excellent steering capacity and long penetration depth, TUS  has the potential to serve as a novel non-invasive deep brain stimulation method  to establish unprecedented neuromodulation and novel neurorehabilitation  protocols. The purpose of the present review is to provide an overview on the  current knowledge about the neuromodulatory effects of TUS while discussing the  potential of TUS in the field of stroke recovery, with respect to existing NIBS  methods.

In  oncology, this approach has demonstrated tumor growth inhibition, and profound  synergistic antitumor effects when combined with traditional platforms of chemo-,  radiation- and immune-therapies. However, the exposure schemes employed have been  broad and underlying mechanisms remain unclear with fundamental questions about  exposures, vessel types and sizes involved, and the nature of bubble behaviors  and their acoustic emissions resulting in vascular damage - impeding the  establishment of standard protocols. Methods: Here, ultrasound transmitters and  receivers are integrated into a murine dorsal window chamber tumor model for  intravital microscopy studies capable of real-time visual and acoustic monitoring  during antivascular ultrasound. Vessel type (normal and tumor-affected), caliber,  and viability are assessed under higher pressure conditions (1, 2, and 3 MPa),  and cavitation signatures are linked to the biological effects. Results: Vascular  events occurred preferentially in tumor-affected vessels with greater incidence  in smaller vessels and with more severity as a function of increasing pressure.  Vascular blood flow shutdown was found to be due to a combination of focal  disruption events and network-related flow changes. Acoustic emissions displayed  elevated broadband noise and distinct sub- and ultra-harmonics and their  associated third-order peaks with increasing pressure.

In the first  research stage, a miniaturized FUS device was developed for the sonification of  the remaining plaque after stenting, known as one of the causes of ISR. METHODS:  This study presents a miniaturized (<2.8 mm) intravascular FUS transducer for ISR  treatment. The performance of the transducer was predicted through a  structural-acoustic simulation, followed by fabrication of the prototype device.  Using the prototype FUS transducer, we demonstrated tissue ablation with  bio-tissues over metallic stents, mimicking in-stent tissue ablation. Next, we  conducted a safety test by detecting the existence of thermal damage to the  arterial tissue upon sonication with a controlled dose. RESULTS: The prototype  device successfully delivered sufficient acoustic intensity (>30 W/cm(2)) to a  bio tissue (chicken breast) through a metallic stent. The ablation volume was  approximately 3.9 × 7.8 × 2.6 mm(3). Furthermore, 1.5 min sonication was  sufficient to obtain an ablating depth of approximately 1.0 mm, not thermally  damaging the underlying artery vessel. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated in-stent  tissue sonoablation, suggesting it could be as a future ISR treatment modality.  SIGNIFICANCE: Comprehensive test results provide a key understanding of FUS  applications using metallic stents. Furthermore, the developed device can be used  for sonoablation of the remaining plaque, providing a novel approach to the  treatment of ISR.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2172-2180","","7","70","","IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37022452","","","","*Coronary Restenosis; Computer Simulation; Humans; Stents; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The perception of such control is based on the perceived ratio of  outcome probabilities given the presence and the absence of agentic behavior. If  an organism believes that options exist to change the probability of a given  outcome, control perception (CP) may emerge. Nonetheless, regarding this model,  not much is known about how the brain processes CP from this information. This  study uses low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound neuromodulation in a  randomized-controlled double blind cross-over design to investigate the impact of  the right inferior frontal gyrus of the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) on this  process. 39 healthy participants visited the laboratory twice (once in a sham,  once in a neuromodulation condition) and rated their control perception regarding  a classical control illusion task. EEG alpha and theta power density were  analyzed in a hierarchical single trial-based mixed modeling approach. Results  indicate that the litFUS neuromodulation changed the processing of stimulus  probability without changing CP. Furthermore, neuromodulation of the right lPFC  was found to modulate mid-frontal theta by altering its relationship with  self-reported effort and worrying. While these data indicate lateral prefrontal  sensitivity to stimulus probability, no evidence emerged for the dependency of CP  on this processing.","2023-08-13","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","108589","","","187","","Neuropsychologia","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

However,  the use of FUS transducers for both therapy and imaging is impractical due to  their low spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise  ratio (CNR). To address this issue, we propose a new method that significantly  improve the quality of images obtained by a FUS transducer. The proposed method  employs coded excitation to enhance SNR and Wiener deconvolution to solve the  problem of low axial resolution resulting from the narrow spectral bandwidth of  FUS transducers. Specifically, the method eliminates the impulse response of a  FUS transducer from received ultrasound signals using Wiener deconvolution, and  pulse compression is performed using a mismatched filter. Simulation and  commercial phantom experiments confirmed that the proposed method significantly  improves the quality of images acquired by the FUS transducer. The -6 dB axial  resolution was improved 1.27 mm to 0.37 mm that was similar to the resolution  achieved by the imaging transducer, i.e., 0.33 mm. SNR and CNR also increased  from 16.5 dB and 0.69 to 29.1 dB and 3.03, respectively, that were also similar  to those by the imaging transducer (27.8 dB and 3.16). Based on the results, we  believe that the proposed method has great potential to enhance the clinical  utility of FUS transducers in ultrasound image-guided therapy.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","107063","","","134","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Focused  ultrasound with microbubbles (FUS) enables BBB disruption, which immediate and  delayed impact on P-gp function remains unclear. Positron emission tomography  (PET) imaging using the radiolabeled substrate [(11)C]metoclopramide provides a  sensitive and translational method to study P-gp function at the living BBB. A  FUS protocol was devised in rats to induce a substantial and targeted disruption  of the BBB in the left hemisphere. BBB disruption was confirmed by the Evan's  Blue extravasation test or the minimally-invasive contrast-enhanced MRI. The  expression of P-gp was measured 24 h or 48 h after FUS using immunostaining and  fluorescence microscopy. The brain kinetics of [(11)C]metoclopramide was studied  by PET at baseline, and both immediately or 24 h after FUS, with or without  half-maximum P-gp inhibition (tariquidar 1 mg/kg). In each condition (n = 4-5  rats per group), brain exposure of [(11)C]metoclopramide was estimated as the  area-under-the-curve (AUC) in regions corresponding to the sonicated volume in  the left hemisphere, and the contralateral volume. Kinetic modeling was performed  to estimate the uptake clearance ratio (R(1)) of [(11)C]metoclopramide in the  sonicated volume relative to the contralateral volume. In the absence of FUS,  half-maximum P-gp inhibition increased brain exposure (+135.0 ± 12.9%, p < 0.05)  but did not impact R(1) (p > 0.05). Immediately after FUS, BBB integrity was  selectively disrupted in the left hemisphere without any detectable impact on the  brain kinetics of [(11)C]metoclopramide compared with the baseline group  (p > 0.05) or the contralateral volume (p > 0.05). 24 h after FUS, BBB integrity  was fully restored while P-gp expression was maximally down-regulated  (-45.0 ± 4.5%, p < 0.001) in the sonicated volume. This neither impacted AUC nor  R(1) in the FUS + 24 h group (p > 0.05). Only when P-gp was inhibited with  tariquidar were the brain exposure (+130 ± 70%) and R(1)(+29.1 ± 15.4%)  significantly increased in the FUS + 24 h/tariquidar group, relative to the  baseline group (p < 0.001). We conclude that the brain kinetics of  [(11)C]metoclopramide specifically depends on P-gp function rather than BBB  integrity. Delayed FUS-induced down-regulation of P-gp function can be detected.  Our results suggest that almost complete down-regulation is required to  substantially enhance the brain delivery of P-gp substrates.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","483-492","","","361","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

However, the potential risks brought by surgery, such as  normal brain tissue damage, post-operative infection, and difficulty in removing  deep hematoma, are still the main problems in the surgical treatment of ICH.  Activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is  reported to show a good therapeutic effect in hematoma clearance.

Subsequent application of focusing  ultrasound (FUS) could enhance drug diffusion, which activates the PPARγ  receptors on macrophages around the hematoma for better hematoma clearance.

The paucity of adequately trained practitioners in Interventional  Psychiatry further exacerbates inequities in the ability of eligible patients to  access and benefit from these approaches. This paper explores the rates of  utilization of Interventional Psychiatry treatments, the current state of  education in these treatments, and the role that training can play in translating  scientific advances in this area to ensure equitable access and maximum impact at  a population level. The majority of the discussion is centered on  electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the most established and available of these  treatments, highlighting how enhancing education and training in ECT can reduce  barriers to its utilization. It is argued that innovations in pedagogical  approaches for disseminating the learning of these procedures are needed to  increase the current low rates of competency in these treatments and can  facilitate the more rapid dissemination of other Interventional Psychiatry  approaches and neurotechnologies, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic  stimulation, ketamine, deep brain stimulation, and focused ultrasound.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","s10-s16","","s1","50","","Can J Neurol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37160678","","","","*Ketamine; *Mental Disorders/therapy; *Psychiatry; Curriculum; Education; Humans; Interventional Psychiatry; Neuromodulation; Neurotechnology; Postgrad medical education; Psychiatry; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three Bama pig models of adenomyosis were  established by autologous endometrial implantation and evaluated by magnetic  resonance imaging, computed tomography, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining.  After the successful construction of the model, the pigs underwent MRgFUS. Before  the modeling surgery, three months after the modeling, and two months after  ablation, the myometrium tissues were clipped, then embedded and H&E stained for  immunohistochemical examination. The average optical density of OTR, VEGF, and  COX-2 were semi-quantitatively analyzed. RESULTS: The adenomyosis models were  established in all Bama pigs and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging,  computed tomography and H&E staining. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed  tomography examination showed that the uterine wall at the modeling site was  significantly thickened with uneven enhancement after contrast injection. All  Bama pigs with adenomyosis lesions underwent MRgFUS without complications. The  expression level of OTR and COX-2 in the myometrium increased three months after  modeling surgery and decreased two months after MRgFUS. The expression level of  VEGF decreased two months after MRgFUS. CONCLUSION: Autologous endometrial  implantation is effective in establishing the adenomyosis model of Bama pigs. It  is feasible to treat adenomyosis in the Bama pig model with MRgFUS. The levels of  OTR, COX-2 and VEGF in the local myometrium decreased after MRgFUS, which may be  associated with symptom relief after treatment.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","S220-S226","","","30 Suppl 2","","Acad Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Association of University Radiologists.

Ultrasound examinations performed by trained nurses in the  intensive care unit (ICU) enable more patients to receive these assessments. This  case series evaluates the use of nurse-led focused cardiac and lung ultrasound  for clinical management of ICU patients with COVID-19. We describe common  pathophysiological findings and how findings were used to inform clinical  decision-making. An ultrasound trained ICU nurse performed Focused Ultrasound in  Intensive Care (FUSIC) cardiac and lung scans enabling calculation of a lung  severity score on adult ICU patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in a  single-centre setting. Fifteen scans were performed on 15 patients. Thirteen  (87%) patients had normal left ventricular function; 12 (80%) normal right  ventricular function. All 15 (100%) scans identified abnormal lung findings  including irregular thickened pleura, B-lines, sub-pleural consolidation and  hepatization. Worse lung severity scores were correlated with higher Acute  Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores (r = 0.70; p = .003).  Of the 15 scans, 10 (67%) identified abnormal pathology contributing to a change  in clinical management. This included targeted fluid removal (4, 27%), change in  respiratory management (3, 20%) and need for formal echocardiographic assessment  (3, 20%).

The  incisionless nature of this procedure has garnered interest from both patients  and providers. As such, an increasing number of centers are initiating new MRgFUS  programs, necessitating development of unique workflows to optimize patient care  and safety. Herein, we describe establishment of a multi-disciplinary team,  workflow processes, and outcomes for a new MRgFUS program. METHODS: This is a  single-academic center retrospective review of 116 consecutive patients treated  for hand tremor between 2020 and 2022. MRgFUS team members, treatment workflow,  and treatment logistics were reviewed and categorized. Tremor severity and  adverse events were evaluated at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-MRgFUS with  the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Part B (CRST-B). Trends in outcome and  treatment parameters over time were assessed. Workflow and technical  modifications were noted. RESULTS: The procedure, workflow, and team members  remained consistent throughout all treatments. Technique modifications were  attempted to reduce adverse events. A significant reduction in CRST-B score was  achieved at 3 months (84.5%), 6 months (79.8%), and 12 months (72.2%)  post-procedure (p < 0.0001). The most common post-procedure adverse events in the  acute period (<1 day) were gait imbalance (61.1%), fatigue and/or lethargy  (25.0%), dysarthria (23.2%), headache (20.4%), and lip/hand paresthesia (13.9%).  By 12 months, the majority of adverse events had resolved with a residual 17.8%  reporting gait imbalance, 2.2% dysarthria, and 8.9% lip/hand paresthesia. No  significant trends in treatment parameters were found. CONCLUSIONS: We  demonstrate the feasibility of establishing an MRgFUS program with a relatively  rapid increase in evaluation and treatment of patients while maintaining high  standards of safety and quality. While efficacious and durable, adverse events  occur and can be permanent in MRgFUS.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","101-111","","2","101","","Stereotact Funct Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 S.

Research involving neuromodulation for SUD has recently gained momentum. This  study evaluated two doses (60 and 90 W) of Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound  (LIFU), targeting the bilateral nucleus accumbens (NAc), in individuals with SUD.  METHODS: Four participants (three male), who were receiving comprehensive  outpatient treatment for opioid use disorder at the time of enrollment and who  also had a history of excessive non-opioid substance use, completed this pilot  study. After confirming eligibility, these participants received 10 min sham LIFU  followed by 20 min active LIFU (10 min to left then right NAc). Outcomes were the  safety, tolerability, and feasibility during the LIFU procedure and throughout  the 90-day follow-up. Outcomes also included the impact of LIFU on cue-induced  substance craving, assessed via Visual Analog Scale (VAS), both acutely (pre-,  during and post-procedure) and during the 90-day follow-up. Daily craving ratings  (without cues) were also obtained for one-week prior to and one-week following  LIFU. RESULTS: Both LIFU doses were safe and well-tolerated based on reported  adverse events and MRI scans revealed no structural changes (0 min, 24 h, and  1-week post-procedure). For the two participants receiving ""enhanced"" (90 W)  LIFU, VAS craving ratings revealed active LIFU attenuated craving for  participants' primary substances of choice relative to sham sonication. For these  participants, reductions were also noted in daily VAS craving ratings (0 = no  craving; 10 = most craving ever) across the week following LIFU relative to  pre-LIFU; Participant #3 pre- vs. post-LIFU: opioids (3.6 ± 0.6 vs. 1.9 ± 0.4),  heroin (4.2 ± 0.8 vs. 1.9 ± 0.4), methamphetamine (3.2 ± 0.4 vs. 0.0 ± 0.0),  cocaine (2.4 ± 0.6 vs. 0.0 ± 0.0), benzodiazepines (2.8 ± 0.5 vs. 0.0 ± 0.0),  alcohol (6.0 ± 0.7 vs. 2.7 ± 0.8), and nicotine (5.6 ± 1.5 vs. 3.1 ± 0.7);  Participant #4: alcohol (3.5 ± 1.3 vs. 0.0 ± 0.0) and nicotine (5.0 ± 1.8 vs. 1.2  ± 0.8) (all p's < 0.05). Furthermore, relative to screening, longitudinal  reductions in cue-induced craving for several substances persisted during the  90-day post-LIFU follow-up evaluation for all participants. DISCUSSION: In  conclusion, LIFU targeting the NAc was safe and acutely reduced substance craving  during the LIFU procedure, and potentially had longer-term impact on craving  reductions. While early observations are promising, NAc LIFU requires further  investigation in a controlled trial to assess the impact on substance craving and  ultimately substance use and relapse.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1211566","","","14","","Front Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Mahoney, Haut, Carpenter, Ranjan, Thompson-Lake, Marton, Zheng, Berry, Tirumalai, Mears, D’Haese, Finomore, Hodder and Rezai.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37779628  PMCID: PMC10540197","","","","addiction; craving; focused ultrasound; neuromodulation; substance use disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Multiple metabolic assays were employed  including measures of fasting glucose and insulin, insulin resistance and glucose  metabolism. The safety and tolerability were also assessed by monitoring adverse  events, changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters and clinical  laboratory measures. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We report post-pFUS trends in  several outcomes that were consistent with previous pre-clinical findings.  Fasting insulin was lowered, resulting in a reduction of HOMA-IR scores (P-value  0.01; corrected Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

However, how transcranial focused  ultrasound stimulation modulates neural activity in anaesthetized rats is  unclear. METHODS: In this study, to answer this question, we used low-intensity  transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) to stimulate the brain tissue of  propofol-anaesthetized mice, recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in the mouse  motor cortex and electromyography (EMG) signals from the mouse neck, and analysed  the emergence and recovery time, mean absolute power, relative power and entropy  of local field potentials. RESULTS: We found that the time to emergence from  anaesthesia in the TUS group (20.3 ± 1.7 min) was significantly less than that in  the Sham group (32 ± 2.6 min). We also found that compared with the Sham group,  20 min after low-intensity TUS during recovery from anaesthesia, (1) the absolute  power of local field potentials in mice was significantly reduced in the [1-4 Hz]  and [13-30 Hz] frequency bands and significantly increased in the [55-100 Hz],  [100-140 Hz] and [140-200 Hz] frequency bands; (2) the relative power of local  field potentials in mice was enhanced at [30-45 Hz], [100-140 Hz] and  [140-200 Hz] frequency bands; (3) the entropy of local field potentials  ([1-200 Hz]) was increased.

The reflecting cone target is attractive  due to its simplicity and long-term stability, at a reasonable cost. However,  accurate measurements using this method depend on the alignment between the  ultrasound beam and cone axes, especially for highly focused beams utilized in  therapeutic applications. With the advent of dual-mode ultrasound arrays (DMUAs)  for imaging and therapy, image-guided measurements of acoustic output using the  RFB method can be used to improve measurement accuracy. In this article, we  describe an image-guided RFB measurement of focused DMUA beams using a widely  used commercial instrument. DMUA imaging is used to optimize the alignment  between the acoustic beam and reflecting cone axes. In addition to image-guided  alignment, DMUA echo data is used to track the displacement of the cone, which  provides an auxiliary measurement of acoustic power. Experimental results using a  DMUA prototype with [Formula: see text] shows that 1-2 mm of misalignment can  result in 5%-14% error in the measured acoustic power. In addition to the use of  B-mode image guidance for improving measurement accuracy, we present preliminary  results demonstrating the benefit of displacement tracking using real-time DMUA  imaging during the application of (sub)therapeutic focused beams. Displacement  tracking provides a direct measurement of the radiation force with high  sensitivity and follows the expected dependence on changes in amplitude and duty  cycle (DC) of the focused ultrasound (FUS) beam. This could lead to simpler, more  reliable methods for measuring acoustic power based on the radiation force  principle. Combined with appropriate computational modeling, the direct  measurement of acoustic radiation force could lead to reliable dosimetry in situ  in emerging applications such as transcranial FUS (tFUS) therapies.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","138-146","","2","70","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36350863  PMCID: PMC10079628","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pain relief was shown to be achieved for all body locations. With some exceptions, these  early relatively small series showed frequent, more or less complete recurrence  of the original pain. The posterior part of the central lateral nucleus in the  human medial thalamus was identified in the 1990s using multiarchitectonic  studies and intraoperative single-cell recordings and was confirmed as a surgical  target. This retrospective patient series extended over 11 years. Its goal was to  demonstrate the efficacy and risk profile of the MR-guided focused ultrasound  (MRgFUS) central lateral thalamotomy (CLT) against chronic and therapy-resistant  neuropathic (i.e., neurogenic) pain. METHODS: In this single-center,  nonrandomized retrospective cross-sectional analysis of consecutive patients, 63  consecutive MRgFUS CLT interventions were performed in 55 patients. RESULTS: The  mean follow-up duration was 55 months. A total of 112 CLT targets were performed,  and the CLT was applied bilaterally in 48 patients and contralateral to their  pain in 7 patients. Repeat MRgFUS interventions were performed in 8 patients. One  serious adverse event with numbness of the upper lip was recorded. The mean pain  relief rated by patients was 42% ± 32% at 3 months, 43% ± 36% at 1 year, and 42%  ± 37% at the last follow-up (n = 63). The proportions of cases with ≥ 30% pain  relief were 65% at 3 months, 63% at 1 year, and 61% at the last follow-up. Good  outcomes (≥ 50% pain relief) were found in 54% of patients at 3 months, 49% at 1  year, and 51% at the last follow-up. The reduction in mean VAS scores showed  similar percentage reductions as those for pain relief (-41% for continuous pain  and -49% for pain attacks) at the 1-year follow-up. The mean frequency of pain  attacks was reduced by 92%. Allodynia was reduced or suppressed in 68% of  patients and never appeared de novo after MRgFUS CLT. CONCLUSIONS: These results  suggest that MRgFUS CLT against neuropathic pain is a safe approach and its  results are stable over time. At a mean follow-up duration of 55 months, the mean  pain relief was 42% and more than 50% of patients still reported ≥ 50% pain  relief. Patients with classical and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia reported a  higher mean pain relief compared with the whole patient group.","2023-09-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","615-624","","3","139","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36840733","","","","*Intralaminar Thalamic Nuclei; *Neuralgia/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Cross-Sectional Studies; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; central lateral thalamotomy; functional neurosurgery; magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound; neuropathic pain; trigeminal neuralgia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Locoregional drug  delivery platforms offer an improved therapeutic index by achieving high drug  concentrations in the target tissue with negligible systemic exposure.  Intrathecal (intraventricular) [IT] and convection-enhanced delivery [CED] are  two clinically relevant methods being employed for various CNS malignancies. Both  of these standalone platforms suffer from passive post-administration  distribution forces, sometimes limiting the desired distribution for tumor  therapy. Focused ultrasound and microbubble-mediated blood-brain barrier opening  (FUS-BBBO) is a recent modality used for enhanced drug delivery. It is postulated  that coupling of FUS with these alternative delivery routes may provide benefits.  Multimodality FUS may provide the desired ability to increase the depth of  parenchymal delivery following IT administration and provide a means for contour  directionality with CED. Further, the transient enhanced permeability achieved  with FUS-BBBO is well established, but drug residence and transit times,  important to clinical dose scheduling, have not yet been defined. The present  investigation comprises two discrete studies: 1. Conduct a comprehensive  quantitative evaluation to elucidate the effect of FUS-BBBO as it relates to  varying routes of administration (IT and IV) in its capacity to facilitate drug  penetration within the striatal-thalamic region. 2. Investigate the impact of  combining FUS-BBBO with CED on drug distribution, with a specific focus on the  temporal dynamics of drug retention within the target region. METHODS: Firstly,  we quantitatively assessed how FUS-BBBO coupled with IT and IV altered  fluorescent dye (Dextran 2000 kDa and 70 kDa) distribution and concentration in a  predetermined striatal-thalamic region in naïve mice. Secondly, we analyzed the  pharmacokinetic effects of using FUS mediated BBB disruption coupled with CED by  measuring the volume of distribution and time-dependent concentration of the dye.  RESULTS: Our results indicate that IV administration coupled with FUS-BBBO  successfully enhances delivery of dye into the pre-defined sonication targets.  Conversely, measurable dye in the sonication target was consistently less after  IT administration. FUS enhances the distribution volume of dye after CED.  Furthermore, a shorter time of residence was observed when CED was coupled with  FUS-BBBO application when compared to CED alone. CONCLUSION: 1. Based on our  findings, IV delivery coupled with FUS-BBBO is a more efficient means for  delivery to deep targets (i.e. striatal-thalamic region) within a predefined  spatial conformation compared to IT administration. 2. FUS-BBBO increases the  volume of distribution (Vd) of dye after CED administration, but results in a  shorter time of residence. Whether this finding is reproducible with other  classes of agents (e.g., cytotoxic agents, antibodies, viral particles, cellular  therapies) needs to be studied.","2023-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","755-763","","","362","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

During the last decade new treatment options were  developed for neurological indications based on blood-brain-barrier opening or  neuromodulation. Recently, the transcranial application of shock waves has been a  subject of research. However, the mechanisms of action are not yet understood.  Hence, it is necessary to know the energy that reaches the brain during the  treatment and the focusing characteristics within the tissue. METHODS: The sound  field of a therapeutic extracorporeal shock wave transducer was investigated  after passing human skull bone (n=5) or skull bone with brain tissue (n=2) in  this ex vivo study. The maximum and minimum pressure distribution and the focal  pressure curves were measured at different intensity levels and penetration  depths, and compared to measurements in water. RESULTS: Mean peak negative  pressures of up to -4.97 MPa were reached behind the brain tissue. The positive  peak pressure was attenuated by between 20.85 and 25.38 dB/cm by the skull bone.  Additional damping by the brain tissue corresponded to between 0.29 and  0.83 dB/cm. Compared to the measurements in water, the pulse intensity integral  in the focal spot was reduced by 84 % by the skull bone and by additional 2 % due  to the brain tissue, resulting in a total damping of up to 86 %. The focal  position was shifted up to 8 mm, whereas the basic shape of the pressure curves  was preserved.

However, although different z-coordinates are used in the literature, there are  no comparative studies available with information on optimal lesion placement.  This study aimed to compare two different MRgFUS lesion targets (z = +2 mm vs z =  0 mm) regarding efficacy and safety outcomes. METHODS: The authors conducted a  retrospective analysis of 52 patients with pharmacoresistant tremor disorders who  received unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy in the ventral intermediate nucleus for  the first time between 2017 and 2022 by one neurosurgeon, with two different  z-coordinates, either z = +2 mm (+2-mm group; n = 17) or z = 0 mm (0-mm group; n  = 35), but otherwise identical parameters. Standardized video-recorded  assessments of efficacy (including the Washington Heights-Inwood Genetic Study of  Essential Tremor scale) and safety (using a standardized grading system) outcomes  at baseline and at 6 months posttreatment were reviewed and compared. Moreover,  overall patient satisfaction was extracted as documented by the examiner at 6  months. RESULTS: Based on a multiple logistic regression analysis, the authors  found that a more dorsal target with a z-coordinate of +2 mm as compared with 0  mm was associated with a higher incidence of any persistent side effect at 6  months (p = 0.02). Most consistently, sensory disturbances, although mild and  nondisturbing in most cases, occurred more frequently in the +2-mm group (35% vs  11%, p = 0.007), while no significant differences were found for gait impairment  (29% vs 35%) and arm ataxia (24% vs 11%). On the other hand, average tremor  suppression was similar (63.6% vs 60.2%) between the groups. Here, higher  efficacy was associated with a higher side effect burden in the 0-mm group but  not in the +2-mm group. Despite the occurrence of side effects, general patient  satisfaction was high (87% would undergo MRgFUS again) as most patients valued  tremor suppression more. CONCLUSIONS: A more ventral MRgFUS target of z = 0 mm  seems to be associated with a more favorable safety and a comparable efficacy  profile as compared with a more dorsal target of z = +2 mm, but prospective  studies are warranted.","2023-11-03","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1-8","","","","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37922562","","","","MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy; MRgFUS; coordinate; functional neurosurgery; tremor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Viscoelastic properties have  been shown to affect cavitation thresholds in both theoretical and ex vivo  models, but the direct effect of temperature on cavitation has not been  investigated in vivo.

In this systematic  review, we propose a summary of the applications of ultrasonography in a  preclinical mouse model of PDAC. Eighty-eight studies met our inclusion criteria.

PURPOSE:  To identify an MRI-based classification system for informing the FUAS outcomes.  STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: Patients with FUAS for adenomyosis, were  divided into a training set (N = 643; 355 with post-FUAS gonadotropin-releasing  hormone/levonorgestrel, 288 without post-FUAS therapy) and an external validation  set (N = 135; all without post-FUAS therapy). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5 T,  turbo spin-echo T2-weighted imaging and single-shot echo-planar  diffusion-weighted imaging sequences. ASSESSMENT: Five MRI-based adenomyosis  classifications: classification 1 (C1) (diffuse, focal, and mild), C2 (intrinsic,  extrinsic, intramural, and indeterminate), C3 (internal, adenomyomas, and  external), C4 (six subtypes on areas [internal or external] and volumes [<1/3 or  ≥2/3]), and C5 (internal [asymmetric or symmetric], external, intramural, full  thickness [asymmetric or symmetric]) for FUAS outcomes (symptom relief and  recurrence). STATISTICAL TESTS: The optimal classification was significantly  associated with the most subtypes of FUAS outcomes. Relating to the timing of  recurrence was measured using Cox regression analysis and median recurrence time  was estimated by a Kaplan-Meier curve. A P value <0.05 was considered  statistically significant. RESULTS: Dysmenorrhea relief and recurrence were only  associated with C2 in training patients undergoing FUAS alone. Compared with  other subtypes, the extrinsic subtype of C2 was significantly associated with  dysmenorrhea recurrence in the FUAS group. Besides, the median dysmenorrhea  recurrence time of extrinsic subtype was significantly shorter than that of other  subtypes (42.0 months vs. 50.3 months). In the validation cohort, C2 was  confirmed as the optimal system and its extrinsic subtype was confirmed to have a  significantly shorter dysmenorrhea recurrence time than other subtypes.

Low-intensity ultrasound, coupled with co-administered cavitation nuclei  consisting of gas-stabilizing sub-micron scale SonoTran Particles, is effective  at increasing therapeutic antibody delivery to xenograft flank tumors in mouse  models. Here, we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in situ  using a large animal model that mimics human pancreatic cancer patients.  Immunocompromised pigs were surgically engrafted with human Panc-1 pancreatic  ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors in targeted regions of the pancreas. These  tumors were found to recapitulate many features of human PDAC tumors. Animals  were intravenously injected with the common cancer therapeutics Cetuximab,  gemcitabine, and paclitaxel, followed by infusion with SonoTran Particles. Select  tumors in each animal were targeted with focused ultrasound to induce cavitation.  Cavitation increased the intra-tumor concentrations of Cetuximab, gemcitabine,  and paclitaxel by 477%, 148%, and 193%, respectively, compared to tumors that  were not targeted with ultrasound in the same animals.

Early postoperative MR imaging demonstrates the location and  extent of the lesion, but there is no consensus on the utility or frequency of  postoperative imaging. We aimed to evaluate the evolution of MRgFUS lesions and  describe the incidence, predictors, and clinical effects of lesion persistence in  a large patient cohort. METHODS: A total of 215 unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy  procedures for essential tremor (ET) by a single surgeon were retrospectively  analyzed. All patients had MR imaging 1 day postoperatively; 106 had imaging at 3  months and 32 had imaging at 1 year. Thin cut (2 mm) axial and coronal  T2-weighted MRIs at these timepoints were analyzed visually on a binary scale for  lesion presence and when visible, lesion volumes were measured. SWI and DWI  sequences were also analyzed when available. Clinical outcomes including tremor  scores and side effects were recorded at these same time points. We analyzed if  patient characteristics (age, skull density ratio), preoperative tremor score,  and sonication parameters influenced lesion evolution and if imaging  characteristics correlated with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Visible lesions were  present in all patients 1 day post- MRgFUS and measured 307.4 ± 128.7 mm(3). At 3  months, residual lesions (excluding patients where lesions were not visible) were  83.6% smaller and detectable in only 54.7% of patients (n = 58). At 1 year,  residual lesions were detected in 50.0% of patients (n = 16) and were 90.7%  smaller than 24 h and 46.5% smaller than 3 months. Lesions were more frequently  visible on SWI (100%, n = 17), DWI (n = 38, 97.4%) and ADC (n = 36, 92.3%). At 3  months, fewer treatment sonications, higher maximum power, and greater distance  between individual sonications led to larger lesion volumes. Volume at 24 h did  not predict if a lesion was visible later. Lesion visibility at 3 months  predicted sensory side effects but was not correlated with tremor outcomes.  DISCUSSION: Overall, lesions are visible on T2-weighted MRI in about half of  patients at both 3 months and 1 year post-MRgFUS thalamotomy.

When the image shows that the lesion has missed the  planned target and the therapeutic effects are insufficient, the target of the  subsequent ablation can be finely adjusted based on the image. The precision of  this adjustment is determined by the image quality. However, the current  intraoperative image quality with a 3.0T MRI system is insufficient for precisely  detecting the lesion. Thus, we developed and validated a method for improving  intraoperative image quality. METHODS: Because intraoperative image quality is  affected by transmitter gain (TG), we acquired T2-weighted images (T2WIs) with  two types of TG: the automatically adjusted TG (auto TG) and the manually  adjusted TG (manual TG). To evaluate the character of images with 2 TGs, the  actual flip angle (FA), the image uniformity, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)  were measured using a phantom. Then, to assess the quality of intraoperative  images, T2WIs with both TGs were acquired during TcMRgFUS for 5 patients. The  contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the lesion was retrospectively estimated.  RESULTS: The images of the phantom with the auto TG showed substantial variations  between the preset and actual FAs (p &lt; 0.01), whereas on the images with the  manual TG, there were no variations between the two FAs (p &gt; 0.05). The total  image uniformity was considerably lower with the manual TG than with the auto TG  (p &lt; 0.01), indicating that the image's signal values with the manual TG were  more uniform. The manual TG produced significantly higher SNRs than the auto TG  (p &lt; 0.01). In the clinical study, the lesions were clearly detected in  intraoperative images with the manual TG, but they were difficult to identify in  images with the auto TG. The CNR of lesions in images with manual TG was  considerably higher than in images with auto TG (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION:  Regarding intraoperative T2WIs using a 3.0T MRI system during TcMRgFUS, the  manual TG method improved image quality and delineated the ablative lesion more  clearly than the current method with auto TG.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","223-231","","4","101","","Stereotact Funct Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Author(s).

How this treatment  affects canonical brain networks has not been elucidated. The purpose of this  study was to clarify changes of brain networks after MRgFUS thalamotomy in ET  patients by analyzing resting-state networks (RSNs). METHODS: Fifteen patients  with ET were included in this study. Left MRgFUS thalamotomy was performed in all  cases, and MR images, including resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), were taken  before and after surgery. MR images of 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls  (HCs) were also used for analysis. Using rsfMRI data, canonical RSNs were  extracted by performing dual regression analysis, and the functional connectivity  (FC) within respective networks was compared among pre-MRgFUS patients,  post-MRgFUS patients, and HCs. The severity of tremor was evaluated using the  Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) score pre- and postoperatively, and its  correlation with RSNs was examined. RESULTS: Preoperatively, ET patients showed a  significant decrease in FC in the sensorimotor network (SMN), primary visual  network (VN), and visuospatial network (VSN) compared with HCs. The decrease in  FC in the SMN correlated with the severity of tremor. After MRgFUS thalamotomy,  ET patients still exhibited a significant decrease in FC in a small area of the  SMN, but they exhibited an increase in the cerebellar network (CN). In comparison  between pre- and post-MRgFUS patients, the FC in the SMN and the VSN  significantly increased after treatment. Quantitative evaluation of the FCs in  these three groups showed that the SMN and VSN increased postoperatively and  demonstrated a trend toward those of HCs. CONCLUSIONS: The SMN and CN, which are  considered to be associated with the cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop, exhibited  increased connectivity after MRgFUS thalamotomy. In addition, the FC of the  visual network, which declined in ET patients compared with HCs, tended to  normalize postoperatively. This could be related to the hypothesis that visual  feedback is involved in tremor severity in ET patients. Overall, the analysis of  the RSNs by rsfMRI reflected the pathophysiology with the intervention of MRgFUS  thalamotomy in ET patients and demonstrated a possibility of a biomarker for  successful treatment.","2023-02-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","306-317","","2","138","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35901706","","","","*Essential Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Thalamus/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Tremor; essential tremor; functional neurosurgery; magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy; resting-state networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the current was less than 0.4 A, the material removal showed  plastic removal at the nanoscale. When the current was more than 0.5 A, the  cavitation phenomenon formed micron-scale impact removal traces on the workpiece  surface. The increase in abrasive concentration increased the impact density and  material removal rate, while excessive abrasive concentration increased the  impeding effect between abrasive particles and reduced the material removal rate.  Moreover, the increase in abrasive particle concentration enhanced heterogeneous  cavitation nucleation, promoted the removal of abrasive impact materials under  the action of a cavitation jet, and inhibited the removal of direct surface  cavitation. The abrasive particle size affects the heterogeneous cavitation  nucleation and the acceleration of the cavitation jet on abrasive particles,  which affects the material removal rate and surface quality. By controlling the  energy of the focused ultrasound and abrasive parameters, the plastic or brittle  domain removal of quartz glass can be achieved at the micro- and nanoscales.","2023-02-03","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","2","14","","Micromachines (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36838082  PMCID: PMC9961036","","","","focused ultrasound; material removal characteristics; quartz glass; ultrasonic abrasive machining; ultrasonic cavitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this short review was to  evaluate current treatment options and low-intensity, pulsed-focused ultrasound  (FUS) as a potential new treatment option for epilepsy. Although some of the  patients could be candidates for surgery, many factors, including poor  health-care infrastructure, socioeconomic status, risks and complications  associated with the surgery, and patients' preferences and attitudes toward the  surgical procedure, limit the adherence to get surgical therapies. Low-intensity  FUS, a novel and noninvasive therapeutic approach, has the potential to be  approved by regulatory bodies and added to the list of standard treatment options  for epilepsy.

Glymphatic transport is believed to be driven by the perivascular  pumping effect created by the pulsation of the arterial wall caused by the  cardiac cycle. Ultrasound sonication of circulating microbubbles (MBs) in the  cerebral vasculature induces volumetric expansion and contraction of MBs that  push and pull on the vessel wall to generate a MB pumping effect. The objective  of this study was to evaluate whether glymphatic transport can be mechanically  manipulated by focused ultrasound (FUS) sonication of MBs. The glymphatic pathway  in intact mouse brains was studied using intranasal administration of  fluorescently labeled albumin as fluid tracers, followed by FUS sonication at a  deep brain target (thalamus) in the presence of intravenously injected MBs.  Intracisternal magna injection, the conventional technique used in studying  glymphatic transport, was employed to provide a comparative reference.  Three-dimensional confocal microscopy imaging of optically cleared brain tissue  revealed that FUS sonication enhanced the transport of fluorescently labeled  albumin tracer in the perivascular space (PVS) along microvessels, primarily the  arterioles. We also obtained evidence of FUS-enhanced penetration of the albumin  tracer from the PVS into the interstitial space. This study revealed that  ultrasound combined with circulating MBs could mechanically enhance glymphatic  transport in the brain.","2023-05-23","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e2212933120","","21","120","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37186852  PMCID: PMC10214201","","","","*Glymphatic System/diagnostic imaging/metabolism; *Microbubbles; Albumins/metabolism; Animals; Brain/diagnostic imaging/metabolism; Mice; Ultrasonography; cerebral blood vessels; focused ultrasound; glymphatic; intranasal; mechanics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is  currently under investigation for other neurological diseases including  refractory neuropathic pain (NP). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic  review is to analyze available evidence about the effectiveness and safety  profile of MRgFUS in the treatment of refractory NP. METHODS: Eligible studies  were identified by searching published studies in PubMed and Scopus databases  from inception to December 2022 and by identifying ongoing studies registered on  the clinicaltrials.gov website. The study was registered in PROSPERO (ID:  CRD42021277154). RESULTS: We found three published observational studies and nine  ongoing studies. In published studies, the involved population ranged from 8 to  46 patients with overall 66 patients being included with NP or trigeminal  neuralgia. The target lesion was in the posterior part of the central lateral  nucleus of the thalamus, bilaterally. Outcomes were assessed at different times  through the Visual Analog Scale, showing a variable degree of improvement.  Adverse events were rare, mild, and transient (vertigo, paresthesias, and  dysesthesias) with intracerebral bleeding being reported as major adverse event  in one case only. Among ongoing studies, we found three prospective, randomized,  sham-controlled, crossover trials (RCTs) and six observational studies. Inclusion  criteria are previous failure of more than three pharmacological treatments and  NP duration longer than 6 months. The thalamus is the main proposed target and  measured outcomes are accuracy of the procedure and pain relief, with a follow-up  period ranging from 1 week to 1 year. CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests  that, although high-quality studies are lacking, available evidence endorses the  effectiveness and safety of MRgFUS in the management of NP.

Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) has deeper penetration than does  light-emitting diode, while its effect on the PVN has not been reported.  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effect of LIFU modulation of the PVN  on the inducibility of post-MI VAs. METHODS: Fifty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were  randomly divided into acute control (n = 12, 22.22%), acute MI (AMI, n = 12,  22.22%), AMI + LIFU (n = 12, 22.22%), chronic control (n = 6, 11.11%), chronic MI  (CMI, n = 6, 11.11%), and CMI + LIFU (n = 6, 11.11%) groups. MI was induced by  left anterior artery ligation, and electrocardiographic recording for 0.5 hours  after MI and programmed electrophysiological stimulation were used to test the  vulnerability of VAs. Peripheral sympathetic neural activity was assessed by  measuring left stellate ganglion neural activity. Finally, hearts and brains were  extracted for Western blotting and histopathological analysis, respectively.  RESULTS: Compared with the AMI group, AMI-induced VAs (P < .05) and left stellate  ganglion neural activity (P < .05) were significantly attenuated in the AMI +  LIFU group. In addition, LIFU resulted in a significant reduction of microglial  activation in the PVN and expression of inflammatory cytokines in the  peri-ischemic myocardium. In the CMI + LIFU group, there was no obvious tissue  damage in the brain. CONCLUSION: LIFU modulation of the PVN may prevent the  incidence of post-MI VAs by attenuating MI-induced sympathetic neural activation  and inflammatory response.","2024-03","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","340-348","","3","21","","Heart Rhythm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Heart Rhythm Society.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The  data of 1427 premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine fibroids who underwent  USgHIFU at four teaching hospitals in China were analyzed retrospectively. The  uterine fibroids were classified based on their T2WI-MRI signal intensities  relative to that of skeletal muscle, myometrium and endometrium as: hypointense,  isointense, heterogeneous hyperintense fibroids (HHF), slightly HHF (sHHF) and  markedly HHF (mHHF), respectively. The rates of symptom relief and reintervention  post-USgHIFU ablation were compared between the classified groups. RESULTS: A  total of 1303 patients were followed up for 44 (40, 49) months. The symptom  relief rate of the hypointense and isointense fibroids was 83.3% and 79.5%,  respectively, which were significantly higher (p < .05) compared to that of HHF,  sHHF and mHHF (58.3%, 44.2% and 60.4%), respectively. sHHF had the lowest symptom  relief rate (p < .05). The cumulative reintervention rate for hypointense,  isointense, HHF, sHHF and mHHF types were 8.8%, 10.8%, 21.4%, 39.9% and 19.8%,  respectively. The reintervention rate of hypointense/isointense fibroids was  significantly lower than that of HHF/mHHF/sHHF (p < .01), while sHHF had the  highest re-intervention rate (p < .01). Thus, reintervention rate is inversely  correlated to the rate of symptom relief. CONCLUSIONS: USgHIFU ablation is  effective for hypointense, isointense, HHF and mHHF with acceptable long-term  follow-up outcomes. However, sHHF is associated with a higher reintervention  rate.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2212887","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37202174","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Leiomyoma/diagnostic imaging/surgery/pathology; *Uterine Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Retrospective Studies; T2-weighted MRI; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography, Interventional; Uterine fibroids; long-term followed-up outcomes; reintervention; ultrasound guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, target tissue accumulation of  anticancer agents is limited by the physical barriers of the tumor  microenvironment. Low-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) in combination with  microbubble (MB) contrast agents can increase microvascular permeability and  improve drug delivery to the target tissue after systemic administration. The  goal of this research was to investigate image-guided FUS-mediated molecular  delivery in volume space. Three-dimensional (3-D) FUS therapy functionality was  implemented on a programmable ultrasound scanner (Vantage 256, Verasonics Inc.)  equipped with a linear array for image guidance and a 128-element therapy  transducer (HIFUPlex-06, Sonic Concepts). FUS treatment was performed on breast  cancer-bearing female mice (N= 25). Animals were randomly divided into three  groups, namely, 3-D FUS therapy, two-dimensional (2-D) FUS therapy, or sham  (control) therapy. Immediately prior to the application of FUS therapy, animals  received a slow bolus injection of MBs (Definity, Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc.)  and near-infrared dye (IR-780, surrogate drug) for optical reporting and  quantification of molecular delivery. Dye accumulation was monitored viain  vivooptical imaging at 0, 1, 24, and 48 h (Pearl Trilogy, LI-COR). Following the  48 h time point, animals were humanely euthanized and tumors excised forex  vivoanalyzes. Optical imaging results revealed that 3-D FUS therapy improved  delivery of the IR-780 dye by 66.4% and 168.1% at 48 h compared to 2-D FUS (p=  0.18) and sham (p= 0.047) therapeutic strategies, respectively.Ex vivoanalysis  revealed similar trends.

Given the real-time  imaging and acoustic energy modulation, this modality enables precise temperature  control within a defined area. Many thermal applications are being explored with  this noninvasive, nonionizing technology, such as hyperthermia generation, to  release drugs from thermosensitive liposomal carriers. These drugs can include  chemotherapies such as doxorubicin, for which targeted release is desired due to  the dose-limiting systemic side effects, namely cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin is a  mainstay for treating a variety of malignant tumors and is commonly used in  relapsed or recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). RMS is the most common solid soft  tissue extracranial tumor in children and young adults. Despite aggressive,  multimodal therapy, RMS survival rates have remained the same for the past 30  years. To explore a solution for addressing this unmet need, an experimental  protocol was developed to evaluate the release of thermosensitive liposomal  doxorubicin (TLD) in an immunocompetent, syngeneic RMS mouse model using MRgHIFU  as the source of hyperthermia for drug release.","2023-01-13","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","DOI: 10.3791/64544 ISSN: 1940-087X Issue: 191 Journal Abbreviation: J Vis Exp Publication Title: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE PMID: 36715427","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Hyperthermia, Induced/methods; *Rhabdomyosarcoma/diagnostic imaging/therapy; Animals; Doxorubicin; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Mice; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, easy implementation of a daily quality  assurance (DQA) method is of great importance for pre-clinical research and  clinical applications. We present here a thermochromic material-based phantom  validated by thermal simulations and found to provide repeatable visual power  output assessments in fewer than 15 s that are accurate to within 10%. Whereas  current available methods such as radiation force balance measurements provide an  estimate of the total acoustic power, we explain here that the thermochromic  phantom is sensitive to the shape of the acoustic field at focus by changing the  aperture of a multi-element transducer with a fixed acoustic power. The proposed  phantom allows the end user to visually assess the transducer's functionality  without resorting to expensive, time-consuming hydrophone measurements or image  analysis.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","269-277","","1","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

A compressible  Euler-Lagrange coupled model has been developed to accurately characterize the  acoustic and thermal fields during this process. This employs a compressible  Navier-Stokes solver for the ultrasound acoustic field and a discrete  singularities model for bubble dynamics. To address the demanding computational  cost relevant to practical medical applications, a multilevel hybrid  message-passing interface (MPI)-open multiprocessing (OpenMP) parallelization  scheme is developed to take advantage of both scalability of MPI and load  balancing of OpenMP. At the first level, the Eulerian computational domain is  divided into multiple subdomains and the bubbles are subdivided into groups based  on which subdomain they fall into. At the next level, in each subdomain  containing bubbles, multiple OpenMP threads are activated to speed up the  computations of the bubble dynamics. For improved throughput, the OpenMP threads  are more heavily distributed to subdomains where the bubbles are clustered. By  doing this, MPI load imbalance issue due to uneven bubble distribution is  mitigated by OpenMP speedup locally for those subdomains hosting more bubbles  than others. The hybrid MPI-OpenMP Euler-Lagrange solver is used to conduct  simulations and physical studies of bubble-enhanced HIFU problems containing a  large number of microbubbles. The phenomenon of acoustic shadowing caused by the  bubble cloud is then analyzed and discussed. Efficiency tests on two different  machines with 48 processors are conducted and indicate 2-3 times speedup with the  same hardware by introducing an OpenMP parallelization in combination with the  MPI parallelization.","2023-07-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","7","145","","J Biomech Eng","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 by ASME.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36897623  PMCID: PMC10158972","","","","*Brain Neoplasms; *Microbubbles; Acoustics; Humans; Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: 64 patients with 89 uterine  fibroids undergoing HIFU ablation (51 sufficient ablations and 38 insufficient  ablations) were enrolled in the study and completed MR imaging and IVIM-DWI  before treatment. The IVIM-DWI parameters, including D (diffusion coefficient),  D(*) (pseudo-diffusion coefficient), f (perfusion fraction) and relative blood  flow (rBF) were calculated. The logistic regression (LR) model was constructed to  analyze the predictors of efficacy. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC)  curve was drawn to assess the model's performance. A nomograph was constructed to  visualize the model. RESULTS: The D value of the sufficient ablation group  (931.0(851.5-987.4) × 10(-6) mm(2)/s) was significantly lower than that of the  insufficient ablation group (1052.7(1019.6-1158.7) × 10(-6) mm(2)/s) (p<0.001).  However, differences in D(*), f, and rBF values between the groups were not  significant (p>0.05). The LR model was constructed with D value, fibroid  position, ventral skin distance, T2WI signal intensity, and contrast enhanced  degree.

Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) is capable of simultaneous monitoring of  HIFU-induced cavitation events using only receive beamforming. Nonetheless,  conventional time exposure acoustics (TEA) algorithm has poor spatial resolution  and suffers from the X-shaped artifacts. These factors lead to difficulties in  precise localization of cavitation source. In this study, we proposed a novel  adaptive PAM method which combines Delay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS) beamforming with  virtual augmented aperture (VA) to overcome the problem. In DMAS-VA beamforming,  the magnitude of each channel waveform is scaled by p-th root while the phase is  multiplied by L. The p and L correspond respectively to the degree of signal  coherence in DMAS beamforming and the augmentation factor of aperture size. After  channel sum, p-th power is applied to restore the dimensionality of source  strength and then the PAM image is reconstructed by accumulating the signal power  over the observation time. Based on simulation and experimental results, the  proposed DMAS-VA has better image resolution and image contrast compared with the  conventional TEA. Moreover, since the VA method may introduce grating lobes into  PAM because of the virtually augmented pitch size, DMAS coherent factor (DCF) is  further developed to alleviate these image artifacts. Results indicate that, with  DCF weighting, the PAM image of DMAS-VA beamforming could be constructed without  detectable image artifacts from grating lobes and false main lobes.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","107125","","","135","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Non-operating room  anesthesia (NORA) represents a growing field of medicine, with an increasing  number of cases performed over the last decade. As a result, anesthesia providers  will need to enhance their understanding of the resources, medical and  paramedical staff, and environment outside the operating room. Patients  undergoing such procedures under light conscious sedation still experience  discomfort such as pain and anxiety, thus requiring the use of pain control  medication or sedative drugs. At the same time, the use of hypnosis is spreading  in medical practice, particularly with minimally invasive procedures. Many  studies have investigated the use of hypnosis in cases of minimally invasive  procedures, showing an effective reduction of patients' discomfort and  consumption of pain control medication, thus improving patient safety. CASE  REPORT We describe the case of a woman in her 70s who underwent a thyroid nodule  thermal ablation through high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) performed under  hypnosis in a NORA setting. The procedure was well endured; the patient  experienced comfort and was satisfied with having avoided general anesthesia.  Post-HIFU follow-up showed a 30% decrease of thyroid nodule volume. The patient  was completely satisfied with the esthetic result. The operator did not encounter  any difficulties with the awoken patient or movements during the procedure.

Limitations  with thrombolytic drugs make the development of adjuvant treatments an active  area of research. One potential adjuvant is histotripsy, a focused ultrasound  therapy that lyses red blood cells within thrombus via the spontaneous generation  of bubbles. Histotripsy has also been shown to improve the efficacy of  thrombolytic drugs, though the precise mechanism of enhancement has not been  elucidated. In this study, in silico calculations were performed to determine the  contribution of histotripsy-induced changes in thrombus diffusivity to alter  catheter-directed therapy. Methods: An established and validated Monte Carlo  calculation was used to predict the extent of histotripsy bubble activity. The  distribution of thrombolytic drug was computed with a finite-difference time  domain (FDTD) solution of the perfusion-diffusion equation. The FDTD calculation  included changes in thrombus diffusivity based on outcomes of the Monte Carlo  calculation. Fibrin degradation was determined using the known reaction rate of  thrombolytic drug. Results: In the absence of histotripsy, thrombolytic delivery  was restricted in close proximity to the catheter. Thrombolytic perfused  throughout the focal region for calculations that included the effects of  histotripsy, resulting in an increased degree of fibrinolysis. Discussion: These  results were consistent with the outcomes of in vitro studies, suggesting  histotripsy-induced changes in the thrombus diffusivity are a primary mechanism  for enhancement of thrombolytic drugs.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1225804","","","14","","Front Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Bader, Flores Basterrechea and Hendley.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37449013  PMCID: PMC10336328","","","","Monte Carlo simulation; ablation; catheter-directed thrombolytics; diffusion; histotripsy; venous thrombosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vagus nerve stimulation improves  treatment-resistant depression in the general population, but research about its  antidepressant efficacy in PD is limited. Here, we administered peripheral  non-invasive focused ultrasound to hemiparkinsonian ('PD') and non-parkinsonian  (sham) rats to mimic vagus nerve stimulation and assessed its antidepressant-like  efficacy. Following 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion, akinesia-like immobility  was assessed in the limb-use asymmetry test, and despair- and anhedonic-like  behaviors were evaluated in the forced swim test and sucrose preference test,  respectively. After, tyrosine hydroxylase immuno-staining was employed to  visualize and quantify dopaminergic degeneration in the substantia nigra pars  compacta, ventral tegmental area, and striatum. We found that PD rats exhibited  akinesia-like immobility and > 90% reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase  immuno-staining ipsilateral to the lesioned side. PD rats also demonstrated  anhedonic-like behavior in the sucrose preference test compared to sham rats. No  6-OHDA lesion effect on immobility in the forced swim test limited conclusions  about the efficacy of ultrasound on despair-like behavior. However, ultrasound  improved anhedonic-like behavior in PD rats and this efficacy was sustained  through the end of the 1-week recovery period. The greatest number of animals  demonstrating increased sucrose preference was in the PD group receiving  ultrasound. Our findings here are the first to posit that peripheral non-invasive  focused ultrasound to the celiac plexus may improve anhedonia in PD with further  investigation needed to reveal its potential for clinical applicability.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","321-336","","2","242","","Exp Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

As functional organization of  human brain strictly follows hierarchical principles which are frequently  deficient in neurological diseases, whether additional damage from MRgFUS  thalamotomy induces further disruptions of ET functional scaffolds are still  controversial. This study was to examine the alteration features of brain  functional frameworks following MRgFUS thalamotomy in patients with ET. We  retrospectively obtained preoperative (ET(pre)) and postoperative 6-month  (ET(6m)) data of 30 ET patients underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy from 2018 to 2020.  Their archived functional MR images were used to functional gradient comparison.  Both supervised pattern learning and stepwise linear regression were conducted to  associate gradient features to tremor symptoms with additional  neuropathophysiological analysis. MRgFUS thalamotomy relieved 78.19% of hand  tremor symptoms and induced vast global framework alteration (ET(6m) vs. ET(pre):  Cohen d = - 0.80, P < 0.001). Multiple robust alterations were identified  especially in posterior cingulate cortex ([Formula: see text] ET(6m) vs.  [Formula: see text] ET(pre): Cohen d = 0.87, P = 0.048).

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate  whether the effects of LIFUS on depression-like behaviors are associated with the  intensity and the underlying mechanisms. We established the depression rats model  using the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and applied the LIFUS with high/low  intensity (Ispta = 500 and 230 mW/cm2, respectively) to the left medial  prefrontal cortex (mPFC) after CUS. We found that two intensities of LIFUS both  could significantly improve depression-like behaviors to a comparable degree. We  further found that theta oscillation synchronization and synaptic functional  plasticity in the hippocampal vCA1-mPFC pathway were significantly improved by  chronic LIFUS which mainly due to the alternation of synaptic structural  plasticity and the expression of post-synaptic proteins in the mPFC.

Current methods make transducer  element phase adjustments to compensate for the variation in skull properties  (shape, thickness, and acoustic properties), but do not account for variations in  the internal brain anatomy. PURPOSE: Our objective is to investigate the effect  of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain anatomy on beam focusing in tcMRgFUS  treatments. METHODS: Simulations were conducted with imaging data from 20  patients previously treated with focused ultrasound for disabling tremor. The  Hybrid Angular Spectrum (HAS) method was used to test the effect of including  cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and brain anatomy in determining the element phases  used for aberration correction and beam focusing. Computer tomography (CT) and  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images from patient treatments were used to  construct a segmented model of each patient's head. The segmented model for  treatment simulation consisted of water, skin, fat, brain, CSF, diploë, and  cortical bone. Transducer element phases used for treatment simulation were  determined using time reversal from the desired focus, generating a set of phases  assuming a homogeneous brain in the intracranial volume, and a second set of  phases assigning CSF acoustic properties to regions of CSF. In addition, for  three patients, the relative effect of separately including CSF speed of sound  values compared to CSF attenuation values was found. RESULTS: We found that  including CSF acoustic properties (speed of sound and attenuation) during phase  planning compared to phase correction without considering CSF increased the  absorbed ultrasound power density ratios at the focus over a range of 1.06 to  1.29 (mean of 17% ± 6%) for 20 patients. Separately considering the CSF speed of  sound and CSF attenuation showed that the increase was due almost entirely to  including the CSF speed of sound; considering only the CSF attenuation had a  negligible effect. CONCLUSIONS: Based on HAS simulations, treatment planning  phase determination using morphologically realistic CSF and brain anatomy yielded  an increase of up to 29% in the ultrasound focal absorbed power density. Future  work will be required to validate the CSF simulations.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","3245-3257","","6","50","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37078516  PMCID: PMC10330438","","","","*Brain/diagnostic imaging; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Skull/diagnostic imaging; focused ultrasound; phase aberration correction; transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focused ultrasound (FUS) neuromodulation non-invasively alters brain activity, likely via acoustic radiation force with dynamics of the pulse  repetition frequency (PRF). PRF impacts neuromodulation as well as indirect  auditory activation, a confound linked to skull vibrations. This study aimed to  minimize these vibrations, by adjusting and randomizing PRF, and determine their  impact on FUS-induced motor activity. We hypothesized that: the skull would  vibrate most at a specific PRF; randomizing PRF would reduce skull vibrations  without affecting motor responses; and FUS would yield motor activity while  actuator-induced skull vibrations would not.Approach. Three objectives were  studied in parallel using C57Bl/6 mice (n= number of mice used per objective).  First, skull vibration amplitude, measured as a percentage of maximum amplitude  per treatment, was recorded via contact microphone over a range of PRFs to assess  the PRF-dependency of skull vibrations (n= 19). Vibrations were then compared  between random and fixed PRFs (n= 15). Lastly, motor responses were compared  between fixed 1.5 kHz PRF FUS, random PRF FUS, air-puff stimulation, sham  stimulation, and vibration induction via piezoelectric actuator (n= 30).Main  Results.The study found amplitude peaked at 1.51 kHz (88.1 ± 11.5%),  significantly higher than at 0.54 kHz (75.5 ± 15.1%;p= 0.0149). Random PRF  reduced amplitude by 4.2% (p= 0.0181). Motor response rates to actuator-induced  skull vibrations at the PRF (5.73 ± 6.96%) and its third harmonic (22.9 ± 22.7%)  were not significantly different than sham (14.1 ± 11.6%), but lower than FUS  (70.2 ± 16.3%;p< 0.0001).Significance. Based on these results, PRF near 0.5 kHz  may best avoid skull vibrations, while random PRF could be utilized to slightly  reduce vibration amplitude. The results also suggested that skull vibrations  likely do not significantly impact motor responses to FUS neuromodulation.","2023-06-30","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","13","68","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Creative Commons Attribution license.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37254870","","","","*Brain/physiology; *Vibration/therapeutic use; Animals; Head; Mice; Rodentia; Skull/diagnostic imaging; focused ultrasound; low-intensity focused ultrasound; motor responses; neuromodulation; preclinical; pulse repetition frequency; skull vibrations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In situ non-invasive, reliable,  and accurate measurement is challenging for multi-layered heterogeneous tissues  within the focusing angle. METHODS: A novel measurement approach is proposed and  its performance is evaluated using ex vivo porcine tenderloin and bovine heart. A  big boiling bubble (i.e., larger than a few millimeters in size) was produced at  the focus as a strong reflector inside the tissue, and the echo amplitudes were  used to determine the acoustic attenuation. Two models, acoustic ray and energy  loss, were developed to derive the equivalent acoustic attenuation coefficient  for a focused beam. RESULTS: The measured acoustic attenuation coefficients of ex  vivo porcine tenderloin and bovine heart at 0.97 MHz and a thickness of 3 cm are  0.159 ± 0.002 and 0.250 ± 0.005 Np/cm, respectively, which are all within the  scope of measured values in the literature. In addition, the echo amplitude is  sensitive to the conditions of the propagation path, and the inverse acoustic  attenuation coefficient of the silicone gel pad placed in front of the tissue  sample was 0.807 ± 0.002 Np/cm, which is comparable to the measurement using the  insertion substitution method, 0.766 ± 0.003 Np/cm. CONCLUSION: Our proposed  approach could determine the tissue acoustic attenuation for focused ultrasound  ablation surgery reliably and accurately in situ. The easy operating protocol may  allow clinical translation and adoption for improved safety and efficacy.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1672-1678","","7","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

The pulsing scheme and mechanisms of BH differ from those of cavitation cloud  histotripsy, which was previously developed for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The  goal of the work described here was to evaluate the feasibility of using BH to  ablate fresh ex vivo human prostate tissue as a proof of principle for developing  BH for prostate applications. Fresh human prostate samples (N = 24) were obtained  via rapid autopsy (<24 h after death, institutional review board exempt). Samples  were analyzed using shear wave elastography to ensure that mechanical properties  of autopsy tissue were clinically representative. Samples were exposed to BH  using 10- or 1-ms pulses with 1% duty cycle under real-time B-mode and Doppler  imaging. Volumetric lesions were created by sonicating 1-4 rectangular planes  spaced 1 mm apart, containing a grid of foci spaced 1-2 mm apart. Tissue then was  evaluated grossly and histologically, and the lesion content was analyzed using  transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Observed shear  wave elastography characterization of ex vivo prostate tissue (37.9 ± 22.2 kPa)  was within the typical range observed clinically. During BH, hyperechoic regions  were visualized at the focus on B-mode, and BH-induced bubbles were also detected  using power Doppler. As treatment progressed, hypoechoic regions of tissue  appeared, suggesting successful tissue fractionation. BH treatment was twofold  faster using shorter pulses (1 ms vs. 10 ms). Histological analysis revealed  lesions containing completely homogenized cell debris, consistent with  histotripsy-induced mechanical ablation. It was therefore determined that BH is  feasible in fresh ex vivo human prostate tissue producing desired mechanical  ablation. The study supports further work aimed at translating BH technology as a  clinical option for prostate ablation.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","62-71","","1","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of low-energy FUS for  patients with chronic neuropathic pain. We conducted a prospective single-arm  trial with 3-month follow-up using new transcranial, navigation-guided, focused  ultrasound (tcNgFUS) technology to stimulate the anterior cingulate cortex.  Eleven patients underwent FUS with a frequency of 250 kHz and spatial-peak  temporal-average intensity of 0.72 W/cm(2). A clinical survey based on the visual  analog scale of pain and a brief pain inventory (BPI) was performed during the  study period. The average age was 60.55 ± 13.18 years-old with a male-to-female  ratio of 6:5. The median current pain decreased from 10.0 to 7.0 (p = 0.021),  median average pain decreased from 8.5 to 6.0 (p = 0.027), and median maximum  pain decreased from 10.0 to 8.0 (p = 0.008) at 4 weeks after treatment.  Additionally, the sum of daily life interference based on BPI was improved from  59.00 ± 11.66 to 51.91 ± 9.18 (p = 0.021). There were no side effects such as  burns, headaches, or seizures, and no significant changes in follow-up brain  magnetic resonance imaging.

Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes are sparse in STS and, when present,  tend to organize around blood vessels or at the periphery of the neoplasm. This  pattern is associated with an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment linked to  overexpression of molecules of the PD-axis. PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression  correlates with malignancy and poor prognosis in other neoplasms in humans and  dogs, but little is known about their role in canine STS, their relationship to  tumour grade, and how different therapies affect expression. The objective of  this study was to evaluate the expression of checkpoint molecules across STS  tumour grades and after tumour ablation treatment. Gene expression analysis was  performed by reverse-transcriptase real-time quantitative PCR in soft tissue  sarcomas that underwent histotripsy and from histologic specimens of STS from the  Virginia Tech Animal Laboratory Services archives. The expression of PD-1, PD-L1  and PD-L2 was detected in untreated STS tissue representing grades 1, 2, and 3.  Numerically decreased expression of all markers was observed in tissue sampled  from the treatment interface relative to untreated areas of the tumour. The  relatively lower expression of these checkpoint molecules at the periphery of the  treated area may be related to liquefactive necrosis induced by the histotripsy  treatment, and would potentially allow TILs to infiltrate the tumour. Relative  increases of these checkpoint molecules in tumours of a higher grade and  alongside immune cell infiltration are consistent with previous reports that  associate their expression with malignancy.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","709-716","","4","21","","Vet Comp Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

Focused ultrasound can assist  movement of drugs into the brain, but frequent and long-term use has remained  impractical. Single-use intracranial drug-eluting depots show promise but are  limited for the treatment of chronic diseases as they cannot be refilled  non-invasively. Refillable drug-eluting depots could serve as a long-term  solution, but refilling is hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which  prevents drug refills from accessing the brain. In this article, we describe how  focused ultrasound enables non-invasive loading of intracranial drug depots in  mice. METHODS: Female CD-1 mice (n = 6) were intracranially injected with  click-reactive and fluorescent molecules that are capable of anchoring in the  brain. After healing, animals were treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound  and microbubbles to temporarily increase the permeability of the blood-brain  barrier and deliver dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-Cy7. The mice were perfused, and  the brains were imaged via ex vivo fluorescence imaging. RESULTS: Fluorescence  imaging indicated small molecule refills are captured by intracranial depots as  long as 4 wk after administration and are retained for up to 4 wk based on  fluorescence imaging. Efficient loading was dependent on both focused ultrasound  and the presence of refillable depots in the brain as absence of either prevented  intracranial loading. CONCLUSION: The ability to target and retain small  molecules at predetermined intracranial sites with pinpoint accuracy provides  opportunities to continuously deliver drugs to the brain over weeks and months  without excessive BBB opening and with minimal off-target side effects.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1679-1685","","7","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

MR-ARFI was evaluated on a  calibrated phantom, then applied to the monitoring of HIFU in a gel phantom, ex  vivo and in vivo porcine muscle tissue, in parallel with MR-thermometry.

In the HIFU monitoring experiments, both the shear  modulus polar map and the thermometry map were updated with every pair of MR-ARFI  phase images acquired with opposite MR-ARFI-encoding. The shear modulus was found  to decrease (phantom and ex vivo) or increase (in vivo) during heating, before  remaining steady during the cooling phase.

Early and effective recovery of coronary  microcirculation perfusion for the management of AMI would be crucial for better  prognosis. Ultrasound assisted thrombolysis in the in-vitro experiments have  great potential for the elimination of acute coronary microthromboembolism,  especially with stable cavitation using low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)  and dodecafluoropentane-loaded acoustic phase-change nanoparticles (DDFP@NPs).  Therefore, our study sought to perform animal experiments using this novel  treatment method in a porcine model with acute coronary microthromboembolism for  further investigation of potential therapeutic values. METHODS: Porcine model  with acute coronary thromboembolism was established using percutaneous coronary  intervention and autologous thrombus injection. For ultrasound assisted  thrombolysis, DDFP@NPs were prepared by rotary evaporation and sonication  process, and LIFU was optimized. Echocardiography and TTC staining were performed  for the evaluation of porcine model establishment and treatment effect. RESULTS:  The treatment using LIFU guided DDFP@NPs had almost completely recanalized  culprit coronary branch after treatment procedure, and smaller infarcted size  (5.4 ± 1.0%), better LVEF (52.5 ± 1.8%) and better coronary microcirculation  after 28 days of treatment, which outperformed treatments using LIFU+SonoVue  microbubbles (infarcted size: 26.4 ± 3.5% and LVEF: 37.2 ± 3.1%) and LIFU only  (infarcted size: 32.2 ± 3.1% and LVEF: 32.2 ± 0.4%) (all P < 0.05), while the  treatment effect were similar to treatment using intravenous tissue-plasminogen  activator (infarcted size: 4.9 ± 0.9% and LVEF: 53.1 ± 1.1%) (all P > 0.05).  CONCLUSIONS: Our study has innovatively established a treatment method using  DDFP@NPs combined with LIFU irradiation for coronary thrombolysis and verified  its treatment effect with high-efficient thrombolysis in the in-vivo experiments,  which can be considered as powerful experimental evident of the novel method for  potential clinical use of acute coronary thrombolysis.

The safety and accuracy of  transcranial MR-guided histotripsy (tcMRgHt) rely on pre-treatment targeting  guidance. In the work described here, we investigated the feasibility and  accuracy of using ultrasound-induced low-temperature heating and MR thermometry  for histotripsy pre-treatment targeting in ex vivo bovine brain. METHODS: A  15-element, 750-kHz MRI-compatible ultrasound transducer with modified drivers  that can deliver both low-temperature heating and histotripsy acoustic pulses was  used to treat seven bovine brain samples. The samples were first heated to an  approximately 1.6°C temperature increase at the focus, and MR thermometry was  used to localize the target. Once the targeting was confirmed, a histotripsy  lesion was generated at the focus and visualized on post-histotripsy MR images.  DISCUSSION: The accuracy of MR thermometry targeting was evaluated with the  mean/standard deviation of the difference between the locus of peak heating  identified by MR thermometry and the center of mass of the post-treatment  histotripsy lesion, which was 0.59/0.31 mm and 1.31/0.93 mm in the transverse and  longitudinal directions, respectively.

While ultrasound is  non-ionizing and can induce hyperthermia deep within the body non-invasively,  achieving uniform and volumetric hyperthermia is challenging. This work presents  a novel focused ultrasound hyperthermia system based on 3D-printed acoustic  holograms combined with a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer to  produce a uniform iso-thermal dose in multiple targets. The system is designed  with the aim of treating several 3D cell aggregates contained in an International  Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) tissue-mimicking phantom with multiple wells,  each holding a single tumor spheroid, with real-time temperature and thermal dose  monitoring. System performance was validated using acoustic and thermal methods,  ultimately yielding thermal doses in three wells that differed by less than 4%.  The system was tested in vitro for delivery of thermal doses of 0-120 cumulative  equivalent minutes at 43 °C (CEM(43)) to spheroids of U87-MG glioma cells. The  effects of ultrasound-induced heating on the growth of these spheroids were  compared with heating using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) thermocycler.

METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to ultrasound  (US) with specific parameters, and electrocardiograms were recorded to analyze  the effect of LIFU and/or vagal denervation on heart rate. Thereafter, myocardial  infarction (MI) was induced by left anterior artery ligation, and LIFU was  performed three times a day for 25 days after MI. Echocardiography, Masson  staining, and ELISA were used to evaluate the effect of LIFU on the structure and  function of the heart. Finally, ELISA, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and Western blot  analysis were performed to determine the effect of LIFU on the inflammation and  the expression of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP)-related  mediators. RESULTS: LIFU reduced heart rate in rats (control vs LIFU, P < .01),  and vagotomy (VT) eliminated this effect of LIFU on heart rate (VT vs LIFU + VT,  P > .01). LIFU-ameliorated IHF in terms of cardiac structure and function (MI vs  MI + LIFU, P < .01), but VT abrogated the beneficial effect of LIFU (MI + VT vs  MI + LIFU + VT, P > .01). After the treatment of LIFU, decreased levels of  inflammatory cytokines, increased proportion of anti-inflammatory macrophages,  and increased expression of CAP-related mediators (MI vs MI + LIFU, P < .01).  CONCLUSIONS: LIFU ameliorates IHF whereas the CAP plays a promising role. LIFU  has the potential to be a novel nonpharmacological and noninvasive therapy for  the treatment of coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular diseases.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","463-475","","2","42","","J Ultrasound Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36444908","","","","*Heart Failure/diagnostic imaging/therapy; *Myocardial Infarction/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/metabolism; AchRα7; Animals; HMGB1; Heart; Neuroimmunomodulation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; TNF-α; cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway; ischemic heart failure; low-intensity focused ultrasound; vagus nerve","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extension of  magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided focused ultrasound for ablation of slowly  perfused cerebrovascular lesions requires a novel treatment monitoring method  that does not rely on thermometry or high-frequency Doppler methods. The goal of  this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of strain estimates  based on MR acoustic radiation force imaging (MR-ARFI) for differentiation of  solids and liquids. METHODS: Strain fields were estimated in gelatin-based  tissue-mimicking focused ultrasound phantoms on the basis of apparent  displacement fields measured by MR-ARFI. MR-ARFI and diffusion-weighted imaging  (DWI) measurements were made before and after FUS-induced heating to evaluate the  performance of displacement, strain and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)  measurements for the discrimination of solid and liquid phases. RESULTS: As  revealed by receiver operating characteristic analyses, axial normal strain and  shear strain components performed significantly better than axial displacement  measurements alone when predicting whether a gelatin had melted. Additional  measurements must be made to estimate certain strain components, so this  trade-off must be considered when developing clinical strategies. ADC had the  best overall performance, but DWI is vulnerable to signal dropouts and  susceptibility artifacts near cerebrovascular lesions, so this metric may have  limited clinical applicability. CONCLUSION: Strain components based on MR-ARFI  apparent displacement measurements perform better than apparent displacement  measurements alone at discriminating between solids and liquids. These methods  are applicable to FUS treatment monitoring and evaluation of mechanical tissue  properties in vivo.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1892-1900","","8","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a modern, noninvasive thermal  ablation method for treating uterine fibroids. There is increasing evidence that  ultrasound guided HIFU (US-HIFU) has no adverse impact on ovarian reserve but  little data exists on magnetic resonance guided HIFU (MR-HIFU). There are  different options to estimate ovarian reserve, perhaps the most reliable being  the measurement of serum Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). MATERIAL AND METHODS:  Seventy-four (74) premenopausal women with serum AMH 0.1 ug/L or over, aged 24-48  and with fibroids or adenomyosis treated with MR-HIFU were enrolled in our study.  AMH levels were analyzed before and 3 months after the MR-HIFU treatment.  Correlations between AMH level changes and position of fibroids, fibroid volume,  non-perfused volume ratio, and treatment energies were studied. RESULTS: The  median AMH level before the HIFU treatment was 1.20 (range: 0.1-7.75 ug/L) and  after the treatment 1.23 (range: 0.1-8.51 ug/L). No significant change was  detected (p = .90). The patients were divided in three subgroups depending on the  baseline AMH levels. The changes were not significant in any of the subgroups.  Neither did the location of the treated fibroid affect the change of AMH levels  nor the total energy used during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MR-HIFU does not  compromise the ovarian reserve. Neither the location of the treated fibroid nor  the total energy used during MR-HIFU had any effect on the change of AMH levels.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2154575","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36535925","","","","*Adenomyosis/therapy; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Leiomyoma/surgery; *Ovarian Reserve; *Uterine Neoplasms/surgery; AMH; Female; Fibroid; Humans; MR-HIFU; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Treatment Outcome; ovarian reserve; thermal ablation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Outcomes per the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST), including  postural tremor scores (CRST Part A), combined hand tremor/motor scores (CRST  Parts A and B), and functional disability scores (CRST Part C), were measured by  a qualified neurologist. The Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire  (QUEST) was used to assess quality of life. CRST and QUEST scores at 48 and 60  months post-MRgFUS were compared to those at baseline to assess treatment  efficacy and durability. All adverse events (AEs) were reported. RESULTS:  Forty-five and 40 patients completed the 4- and 5-year follow-ups, respectively.  CRST scores for postural tremor (Part A) for the treated hand remained  significantly improved by 73.3% and 73.1% from baseline at both 48 and 60 months  posttreatment, respectively (both p < 0.0001). Combined hand tremor/motor scores  (Parts A and B) also improved by 49.5% and 40.4% (p < 0.0001) at each respective  time point.

It targets the  ventrointermedius (Vim) nucleus, which is the thalamic relay in a proprioceptive  pathway, and contains kinesthetic cells. Although MRgFUS thalamotomy reduces some  risks associated with more invasive surgeries, it still has side effects, such as  balance and gait disturbances; these may be caused by the lesion impacting  proprioception. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to quantitatively measure the effects of  MRgFUS on proprioception and limb use in essential tremor patients. We  hypothesized that this thalamotomy alters proprioception, because the  sensorimotor Vim thalamus is lesioned. METHODS: Proprioception was measured using  the Kinarm exoskeleton robot in 18 patients. Data were collected pre-operatively,  and then 1 day, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. Patients completed four  tasks, assessing motor coordination and postural control, goal-directed movement  and bimanual planning, position sense, and kinesthesia. RESULTS: Immediately  after surgery there were changes in posture speed (indicating tremor  improvement), and in bimanual hand use, with the untreated limb being preferred.  However, these measures returned to pre-operative baseline over time. There were  no changes in parameters related to proprioception. None of these measures  correlated with lesion size or lesion-overlap with the dentato-rubro-thalamic  tract. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first quantitative assessment of proprioception  and limb preference following MRgFUS thalamotomy. Our results suggest that  focused-ultrasound lesioning of the Vim thalamus does not degrade proprioception  but alters limb preference. This change may indicate a required ""relearning"" in  the treated limb, because the effect is transient. © 2023 The Authors.

Independence from the heat-sink  effect of blood flow makes HIFU an interesting technique for focal ablation of  liver tumors. Current available technology is based on extracorporeal treatment  that limits use of HIFU for the treatment of liver tumors, as elementary  ablations are small and must be juxtaposed to treat tumors, resulting in  long-duration treatment. We developed an HIFU probe with toroidal technology,  which increases the volume of ablation, for intra-operative use, and we assessed  the feasibility and efficacy of this device in patients with colorectal liver  metastasis (CLM) measuring less than 30 mm. METHODS: This study was an  ablate-and-resect, prospective, single-center, phase II study. All ablations were  performed in the area of liver scheduled for liver resection to avoid loss of  chance of recovery. The primary objective was to ablate CLM with safety margins  (>5 mm). RESULTS: Between May 2014 and July 2020, 15 patients were enrolled and  24 CLM were targeted. The HIFU ablation time was 370 s. In total, 23 of 24 CLM  were successfully treated (95.8%). No damage occurred to extrahepatic tissues.  HIFU ablations were oblate shaped with an average long axis of 44.3 ± 6.1 mm and  an average shortest axis of 35.9 ± 6.7 mm. On pathological examination, the  average diameter of the treated metastasis was 12.2 ± 4.8 mm.

Therefore, we  conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pregnancy  outcomes of HIFU groups versus UAE groups with CSP. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed,  EMBASE, Cochrane, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases  were systematically searched to find studies that compared the therapeutic  effects of HIFU groups versus UAE groups. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Our primary  end points were blood loss, adverse events, success rate, and repregnancy. We  implemented random-effects models or fixed-effects models to evaluate the pooled  data. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Thirty-four eligible items were  included in studies. The blood loss was significantly reduced in HIFU groups  compared with UAE groups (standardized mean difference = -1.45, 95% confidence  interval [CI], 2.21 to -0.68; p <.001). Significantly fewer adverse events  occurred in the HIFU groups than in UAE groups (odds ratio [OR] = 0.36, 95% CI,  0.23-0.57; p <.001).

To reduce adverse effects, the field has migrated  to treating at 2 mm above the anterior commissure-posterior commissure plane. We  perform MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound with an advanced imaging  targeting technique, four-tract tractography. Four-tract tractography uses  diffusion tensor imaging to identify the critical white matter targets for tremor  control, the decussating and non-decussating dentatorubrothalamic tracts, while  the corticospinal tract and medial lemniscus are identified to be avoided. In  some patients, four-tract tractography identified a risk of damaging the medial  lemniscus or corticospinal tract if treated at 2 mm superior to the anterior  commissure-posterior commissure plane. In these patients, we chose to target  1.2-1.5 mm superior to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure plane. In  these patients, post-operative imaging revealed that the focused ultrasound  lesion extended into the posterior subthalamic area. This study sought to  determine if patients with focused ultrasound lesions that extend into the  posterior subthalamic area have a differnce in tremor improvement than those  without. Twenty essential tremor patients underwent MRI-guided high-intensity  focused ultrasound and were retrospectively classified into two groups. Group 1  included patients with an extension of the thalamic-focused ultrasound lesion  into the posterior subthalamic area. Group 2 included patients without extension  of the thalamic-focused ultrasound lesion into the posterior subthalamic area.  For each patient, the percent change in postural tremor, kinetic tremor and  Archimedes spiral scores were calculated between baseline and a 3-month  follow-up. Two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare the  improvement in tremor scores, the total number of sonications, thermal dose to  achieve initial tremor response, and skull density ratio between groups. Group 1  had significantly greater postural, kinetic, and Archimedes spiral score percent  improvement than Group 2 (P values: 5.41 × 10(-5), 4.87 × 10(-4), and 5.41 ×  10(-5), respectively). Group 1 also required significantly fewer total  sonications to control the tremor and a significantly lower thermal dose to  achieve tremor response (P values: 6.60 × 10(-4) and 1.08 × 10(-5),  respectively). No significant group differences in skull density ratio were  observed (P = 1.0). We do not advocate directly targeting the posterior  subthalamic area with MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound because the  shape of the focused ultrasound lesion can result in a high risk of adverse  effects. However, when focused ultrasound lesions naturally extend from the  thalamus into the posterior subthalamic area, they provide greater tremor control  than those that only involve the thalamus.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","fcad165","","4","5","","Brain Commun","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2023.

However, the shortage of human donor organs  for cell isolation, the low cell yield from decellularisation regimes, and low  engraftment rates from portal administration of donor cells have restricted its  clinical application. Using ultrasound histotripsy to provide a nidus in the  liver for direct cell transplantation offers a new approach to overcoming key  limitations in current cell therapy. We have analysed the liver cavity  constituents to assess their potential as a site for cell delivery and  implantation. Methods: Using human organ retrieval techniques, pig livers were  collected from the abattoir and transported in ice-cold storage to the  laboratory. Following 2 h of cold storage, the livers were flushed with organ  preservation solution and placed on an organ perfusion circuit to maintain  viability. Organs were perfused with Soltran™ organ preservation solution via the  portal vein at a temperature of 24-30 °C. The perfusion circuit was oxygenated  through equilibration with room air. Perfused livers (n=5) were subjected to  ultrasound histotripsy, producing a total of 130 lesions. Lesions were generated  by applying 50 pulses at 1 Hz pulse repetition frequency and 1% duty cycle using  a single element 2 MHz bowl-shaped transducer (Sonic Concepts, H-148). Following  histotripsy, a focal liver lesion was produced, which had a liquid centre. The  fluid from each lesion was aspirated and cultured in medium (RPMI) at 37 °C in an  incubator. Cell cultures were analysed at 1 and 7 days for cell viability and a  live-dead assay was performed. The histotripsy sites were excised following  aspiration and H&E staining was used to characterise the liver lesions. Cell  morphology was determined by histology. Results: Histotripsy created a  subcapsular lesion (~5 mm below the liver capsule; size ranging from 3 to 5 mm),  which contained a suspension of cells. On average, 61×10(4) cells per mL were  isolated. Hepatocytes were present in the aspirate, were viable at 24 h post  isolation and remained viable in culture for up to 1 week, as determined by  phalloidin/DAPI cell viability stains. Cultures up to 21 days revealed  metabolically active live hepatocyte. Live-dead assays confirmed hepatocyte  viability at 1 week (Day 1: 12% to Day 7: 45% live cells; p < 0.0001), which  retained metabolic activity and morphology, confirmed on assay and microscopy.  Cell Titre-Glo(TM) showed a peak metabolic activity at 1 week (average  luminescence 24.6 RLU; p < 0.0001) post-culture compared with the control  (culture medium alone), reduced to 1/3 of peak level (7.85 RLU) by day 21.  Conclusions: Histotripsy of the liver allows isolation and culture of hepatocytes  with a high rate of viability after 1 week in culture. Reproducing these findings  using human livers may lead to wide clinical applications in cell therapy.","2023-02-20","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","2","10","","Bioengineering (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36829770  PMCID: PMC9952788","","","","HIFU; adult hepatocyte; boiling histotripsy; cell isolation; cell transplantation; high-intensity focused ultrasound; liver transplantation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The superiority of HIFU  therapy targeting uterine leiomyoma blood vessels, however, still needs to be  further explored. This study aims to evaluate the long-term efficacy of fibroid  devascularization with ultrasound-guided HIFU (USgHIFU) and the effects of  treatment on the ovarian reserve and endometrial injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Fibroid devascularization was assessed with the Adler grade obtained by color  Doppler flow imaging and power Doppler imaging (PDI). The targeted vessels were  covered and then sonicated by HIFU focal spots. The patients were followed up at  1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years after treatment. Adverse  effects and complications were recorded. The non-perfusion volume rate (NPVR),  fibroid volume shrinkage rate (FVSR), Adler Grade, symptom severity score (SSS)  and uterine fibroid symptom and quality of life (UFS-QOL) were evaluated. Adverse  events (AEs) were recorded. In Center 1, the enrolled patients completed the  anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) test before and at 6 months after treatment.  RESULTS: A total of 117 eligible patients were consecutively enrolled to receive  interventions and follow-up evaluations of the three centers from January 2019 to  May 2023. The 1-month and 6-month NPVRs were 66.60% ± 33.14% and 51.12% ± 39.84%,  respectively. The mean FVSRs at 1 month and 6 months after treatment were 38.20%  and 43.89%, respectively. No significant difference was observed in AMH levels  before and after treatment (p > 0.05). No irreversible endometrial injury was  observed in MR images after HIFU treatment. No significant difference was  observed in both 1-month and 6-month FVSRs among Center 1, 2 and 3 (p > 0.05). No  severe AEs occurred. For long-term outcomes, significant differences were  observed in Adler grade, FV, FVSR, SSS, reduction in SSS and UFS-QOL before and  after treatment (p < 0.001) whereas no significant difference was observed in  Adler grade among 3 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years after treatment  (p > 0.05). The SSSs were reduced by 33.42% at 1 year, 42.32% at 2 years and  52.46% at 3 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: For patients with uterine  fibroids, USgHIFU-induced devascularization is a safe and effective treatment  option. It has little effect on ovarian function and the endometrial injury is  reversible, which could be attractive for patients who plan to become pregnant.","2023-11-16","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","S1076-6332(23)00599-8","","","","","Acad Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Association of University Radiologists.

This includes histotripsy, which is a noninvasive,  non-ionizing, non-thermal ultrasound guided ablation modality. As histotripsy has  progressed from bench-to-bedside, it has become evident that this therapy has  benefits beyond local tumor ablation. Specifically, histotripsy has the potential  to shift the local tumor microenvironment from immunologically 'cold' to 'hot'.  This is associated with the production of damage associated molecular patterns,  the release of a selection of proinflammatory mediators, and the induction of  inflammatory forms of cell death in cells just outside of the treatment zone. In  addition to the induction of this innate immune response, histotripsy can also  improve engagement of the adaptive immune system and promote systemic anti-tumor  immunity targeting distal tumors and metastatic lesions. These tantalizing  observations suggest that, in settings of widely metastatic disease burden,  selective histotripsy of a limited number of accessible tumors could be a means  of maximizing responsiveness to systemic immunotherapy. More work is certainly  needed to optimize treatment strategies that best synergize histotripsy  parameters with innate and adaptive immune responses. Likewise, rigorous clinical  studies are still necessary to verify the presence and repeatability of these  phenomena in human patients. As this technology nears regulatory approval for  clinical use, it is our expectation that the insights and immunomodulatory  mechanisms summarized in this review will serve as directional guides for  rational clinical studies to validate and optimize the potential  immunotherapeutic role of histotripsy tumor ablation.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2244206","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37580047  PMCID: PMC10430775","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; *Neoplasms/pathology; Humans; Immunity; Immunology; Tumor Microenvironment; Ultrasonography; abscopal effect; adaptive immunity; cancer; focused ultrasound; immunotherapy; innate immunity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Radical, whole-gland  therapies, such as prostatectomy or radiotherapy, are definitive treatments for  PCa, but they are associated with significant morbidity, including erectile  dysfunction and urinary incontinence. Focal therapies for PCa, whereby the part  of gland harboring disease is selectively treated, spares the normal surrounding  structures, and minimizes the morbidity associated with whole gland treatment.  The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance provides advantages over  ultrasound guidance, such as better localization and targeting of clinically  significant PCa (csPCa), as well as MRI thermometry which optimizes tissue  ablation temperatures. This review will discuss two MRI-guided high-intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU) techniques - transrectal MR-guided focused ultrasound  (MRgFUS) and TULSA (transurethral ultrasound ablation) ablation for localized  PCa. Overall, recent major trials for MRgFUS and TULSA have shown promising  oncological and functional results in the treatment of low- to intermediate-risk  PCa. Recent Phase II MRgFUS trials have shown better oncologic outcomes than the  published results for focal ultrasound guided HIFU and may justify the additional  costs associated with MRI guidance. While initial studies on TULSA have focused  on subtotal gland ablation, recent trials assessing oncological outcomes for  focal treatment of angular sectors have shown promise.","2022","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1069518","","","12","","Front Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Alabousi and Ghai.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36686753  PMCID: PMC9846805","","","","Focal Therapy; HIFU; MRI; MRI-guided intervention; Prostate MRI; prostate ablation; prostate cancer; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, no effective strategies combined with ICB therapy are available to  overcome low therapeutic efficiency and severe side effects. Ultrasound-targeted  microbubble destruction (UTMD) is an effective and safe technique holding the  promise to decrease tumor blood perfusion and activate anti-tumor immune response  based on the cavitation effect. Herein, we demonstrated a novel combinatorial  therapeutic modality combining low-intensity focused ultrasound-targeted  microbubble destruction (LIFU-TMD) with PD-L1 blockade. LIFU-TMD caused the  rupture of abnormal blood vessels to deplete tumor blood perfusion and induced  the tumor microenvironment (TME) transformation to sensitize anti-PD-L1  immunotherapy, which markedly inhibited 4T1 breast cancer's growth in mice. We  discovered immunogenic cell death (ICD) in a portion of cells induced by the  cavitation effect from LIFU-TMD, characterized by the increased expression of  calreticulin (CRT) on the tumor cell surface. Additionally, flow cytometry  revealed substantially higher levels of dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8(+) T cells  in draining lymph nodes and tumor tissue, as induced by pro-inflammatory  molecules like IL-12 and TNF-α. These suggest that LIFU-TMD as a simple,  effective, and safe treatment option provides a clinically translatable strategy  for enhancing ICB therapy.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1173381","","","11","","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Wu, Cao, Liu, Zhou, He, Tang, Wan, Wang, Xiong, Zhong and Li.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37139047  PMCID: PMC10150078","","","","antivascular therapy; cavitation; immune checkpoint blockade; immune infiltration; low-intensity focused ultrasound; microbubble","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Low-intensity  focused ultrasound (LIFU), a new method to stimulate the brain and open the  blood-brain barrier (BBB), has been widely concerned by PD researchers due to its  non-invasive characteristics.Methods: PubMed was searched for the past 10 years  using the terms 'focused ultrasound', 'transcranial ultrasound', 'pulse  ultrasound', and 'Parkinson's disease'. Relevant citations were selected from the  authors' references. After excluding articles describing high-intensity focused  ultrasound or non-Parkinson's disease applications, we found more than 100  full-text analyses for pooled analysis.Results: Current preclinical studies have  shown that LIFU could improve PD motor symptoms by regulating microglia  activation, increasing neurotrophic factors, reducing oxidative stress, and  promoting nerve repair and regeneration, while LIFU combined with microbubbles  (MBs) can promote drugs to cross the BBB, which may become a new direction of PD  treatment. Therefore, finding an efficient drug carrier system is the top  priority of applying LIFU with MBs to deliver drugs.Conclusions: This article  aims to review neuro-modulatory effect of LIFU and the possible biophysical  mechanism in the treatment of PD, summarize the latest progress in delivering  vehicles with MBs, and discuss its advantages and limitations.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2251145","","2","55","","Ann Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37634059  PMCID: PMC10461511","","","","*Parkinson Disease/therapy; *Ultrasonography; Blood-Brain Barrier/physiopathology; Brain; Humans; Parkinson’s disease; low intensity pulsed ultrasound; low-intensity focused ultrasound; mechanism; microbubbles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, numerous experiences  and indications for the use of FUS in clinical and preclinical studies have  rapidly expanded. Focused ultrasound-mediated BBB opening induces cognitive  enhancement and neurogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been  elucidated. METHODS: Here, we investigate the effects of FUS-mediated BBB opening  on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive function in a 5xFAD  mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We applied FUS with microbubble to the  hippocampus and LTP was measured 6 weeks after BBB opening using FUS. Field  recordings were made with a concentric bipolar electrode positioned in the CA1  region using an extracellular glass pipette filled with artificial cerebrospinal  fluid. Morris water maze and Y-maze was performed to test cognitive function.  RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that FUS-mediated BBB opening has a significant  impact on increasing LTP at Schaffer collateral - CA1 synapses and rescues  cognitive dysfunction and working memory. These effects persisted for up to 7  weeks post-treatment. Also, FUS-mediated BBB opening in the hippocampus increased  PKA phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Therefore, it could be a promising treatment for  neurodegenerative diseases as it remarkably increases LTP, thereby improving  working memory.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","857-866","","3","16","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Traditional whole-gland  salvage treatments offered up to a 50% 5-year disease-free survival rate but with  troubling levels of risk for significant complications. Recent progress in  advanced imaging techniques has allowed a more accurate selection of patients  with local-only recurrence and a selection of patients that may be suitable for  newer partial-gland salvage treatments that may reduce late complications.  METHODS: This article reviews advances in patient selection and provides an  overview of whole- and partial-gland salvage results from selected recent  meta-analyses, multi-institutional series, and studies from centers of excellence  for these treatment approaches. RESULTS: Salvage radical prostatectomy produces  5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates in the 50%-60% range with severe  gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in < 2% but severe genitourinary (GU) toxicity in  15%-23% of patients. The whole-gland options of high and low dose rate  brachytherapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy appear to offer similar  5-year control rates, with low severe GU and GI toxicity rates of 4%-8% and <2%,  respectively. Cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) offer  similar 5-year RFS rates but carry significant risks for severe GU and GI  toxicity in the range of 10%-27% and <2%, respectively. Early results of  partial-gland salvage techniques in selected patients appear promising, with  3-year RFS rates of 48%-72% and rare grade 3 toxicity. CONCLUSION: It is  important to understand the relative effectiveness and risks of the various  treatment options to effectively counsel patients who face this distressing  clinical situation. Whole-gland salvage options offer the possibility of  long-term control but with significant risks of severe toxicity. Emerging data  for the partial-gland salvage options in appropriately selected patients may  offer hope of reasonable control rates with reduced severe toxicity.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1001-1010","","11","83","","Prostate","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37150849","","","","*Brachytherapy/adverse effects/methods; *Prostatic Neoplasms/radiotherapy/surgery/drug therapy; Humans; Male; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/therapy; Prostate/pathology; Prostatectomy; Salvage Therapy/methods; local salvage; patient selection; prostate cancer; radiotherapy failure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most are solitary and do not show signs of  malignant spread. Multiple synchronous or metachronous panNENs / insulinomas may  occur in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1). The diagnosis of an  insulinoma requires demonstration of inappropriately high insulin, proinsulin or  C-peptide levels for the prevailing hypoglycemia in a 72h fast. Localization of  the tumor and exclusion or confirmation of metastatic disease by computed  tomography is still the preferred initial option followed by endoscopic  ultrasonography (EUS) or MRI. Glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1R) receptor  positron emission tomography (PET) CT or MRI is a highly sensitive localization  technique for indolent, localized (“benign”) insulinomas. For single solitary  tumors surgical excision or radiofrequency ablation are the treatments of choice.  In aggressive malignant (metastatic) cases, debulking of the panNENs, including  locoregional lymph nodes can be considered. If hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia  persist, diazoxide with a thiazide diuretic relieves hypoglycemia. Liver  metastases can be resected, or treated by bland embolization, radioembolization  (SIRT), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave and cryoablation, high-intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU), laser, brachytherapy and irreversible electroporation  (IRE) depending on local availability. In patients with unresectable low-grade  metastatic malignant insulinomas, the long-acting somatostatin analog Lanreotide  Autogel is the approved first-line therapy for control of tumor growth and  sometimes control of hypoglycemia is achieved with this drug. If indicated,  peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT) with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs, or  Everolimus can be used for tumor, symptom and glucose control. Malignant NENs can  also be treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, particularly those with a  high tumor grade.
