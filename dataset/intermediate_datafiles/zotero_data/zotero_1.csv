Bilateral symptoms are typical; however, bilateral thalamotomy for essential  tremor is associated with a high probability of adverse events. We  retrospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of staged bilateral ventral  intermediate nucleus thalamotomy for refractory essential tremor using magnetic  resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound. METHODS: We enrolled 5 consecutive  patients with refractory essential tremor between September 2016 and March 2020.  Patients underwent a second operation at least 1 year after the first operation.  The second lesion was created asymmetrically to the first lesion. RESULTS: Mean  patient age was 57.6 years, and the mean interval between the 2 operations was  27.8 months. The second lesion center was superior to the first lesion in all  patients. The mean baseline, second preoperative, and second postoperative  Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor total scores were 63.6, 49.2, and 21.8,  respectively. The mean baseline, second preoperative, and second postoperative  Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor part C scores were 18.4, 8.2, and 2.6,  respectively. One patient had permanent adverse events of slight dysarthria and  discomfort in the tongue. No patient experienced dysphagia or cognitive  dysfunction after the second operation. Four of the 5 patients were satisfied  with the results of the bilateral treatment, including the patient who had  permanent adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused  ultrasound is an effective method for bilateral thalamotomy when adhering to the  following considerations: (1) asymmetrical lesions are created and (2) sufficient  interval (>1 year) between operations.","2022","2024-03-06 17:02:28","2024-03-06T17:02:28Z","","44-52","","1","100","","Stereotact Funct Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 S.

Here, we fabricated ultrasound-responsive nanobubbles (NBs) to load AEP  inhibitor RR-11a, and modified the NB surface with either AEP recognizable  peptide AAN or pro-transendothelial transversal motif RGD, i.e. NB(11a)-A and  NB(11a)-R, for AEP-targeted treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The developed  NBs were uniform, small in size (50.1 ± 1.5 nm), with strong echogenicity and  high drug loading efficiency (∼91.97%). When intravenously co-injected in the  APP/PS1 mouse model, NB(11a)-R could adhere to endothelial cells and enhance  transient opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) upon focused ultrasound  oscillations, allowing the rest NBs/localized released RR-11a molecules to enter  the brain, and then NB(11a)-A could selectively bind with the impaired neurons  and deposit RR-11a molecules at the AD lesion. As a result, co-administration of  NB(11a)-A and NB(11a)-R significantly promoted accumulation of RR-11a in the  mouse brain, and substantially alleviated both tau cleavage and amyloid plaques  deposition in the hippocampus. Most strikingly, the cognitive ability of the AD  model mice was dramatically improved, achieving a level close to the normal mice.  Overall, this unique AEP-targeted nanobubble design provides an efficient  intracerebral drug delivery strategy and significantly enhances treatment  efficacy of AD. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) is an  innovative therapeutic target simultaneously involved in Aβ and tau-mediated  Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but targeted delivery of AEP inhibitors has  not been achieved yet. Here we developed an efficient strategy to deliver AEP  inhibitor RR-11a towards impaired neurons. We fabricated RR-11a-loaded  ultrasound-responsive nanobubbles (NBs) and modified the NB surface with RGD  peptide to promote BBB crossing upon focused ultrasound oscillations, or with AAN  peptide to increase binding of NBs on the neurons. Our results indicated that,  co-administration of the NB(11a)-A and NB(11a)-R significantly enhanced  accumulation of RR-11a molecules at the AD lesion, alleviated both tau cleavage  and amyloid plaques deposition in the hippocampus, and consequently restored  cognitive function of the AD model mice.","2022-03-15","2024-03-06 17:02:24","2024-03-06T17:02:24Z","","388-397","","","141","","Acta Biomater","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

Focused ultrasound offers a novel modality for the treatment of various  forms of cancer which may offer effective oncological control and low morbidity.  We performed a review of PubMed articles assessing the current applications of  focused ultrasound in the treatment of genitourinary cancers, including prostate,  kidney, bladder, penile, and testicular cancer. Current research indicates that  high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) focal therapy offers effective  short-term oncologic control of localized prostate and kidney cancer with lower  associated morbidity than radical surgery. In addition, studies in mice have  demonstrated that focused ultrasound treatment increases the accuracy of  chemotherapeutic drug delivery, the efficacy of drug uptake, and cytotoxic  effects within targeted cancer cells. Ultrasound-based therapy shows promise for  the treatment of genitourinary cancers. Further research should continue to  investigate focused ultrasound as an alternative cancer treatment option or as a  complement to increase the efficacy of conventional treatments such as  chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","2022-03-17","2024-03-06 17:02:23","2024-03-06T17:02:23Z","","","","6","14","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 35326687  PMCID: PMC8945954","","","","cancer; review; treatment; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total of 80 patients were  recruited. All patients were divided into the pregnancy group (64 cases) and the  non-pregnancy group (16 cases). The pregnancy group was categorized into the good  pregnancy outcome (GOP) group (46 cases) and adverse pregnancy outcome (APO)  group (18 cases). The general data of all study subjects were collected. The  changes of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),  inhibin B (INHB), and antral follicle count (AFC) before HIFU and 3, 6, and  12 months after HIFU were compared.

RESULTS: There were no significant differences  in AMH, FSH, INHB levels, and AFC at 6 and 12 months after HIFU compared with  those before HIFU in pregnancy and non-pregnancy groups (p > 0.05). This study  demonstrated that patients with prior history of pregnancy, younger age, lower  body mass index (BMI), and smaller fibroids volume had a higher pregnancy rate  (p < 0.05). Besides, younger age and smaller fibroids volume were associated with  better pregnancy outcomes (p < 0.05).

METHODS: A  128-element 11 MHz array for skull localization was integrated within a  256-module multi-frequency (306/612/1224 kHz) dual-mode phased array. The  system's transcranial transmit and receive performance was evaluated with ex-vivo  human skullcaps using phase aberration corrections calculated from computed  tomography (CT)-based simulations via ultrasound-based (USCT) and landmark-based  (LMCT) registrations, and a gold-standard fixed source emitter (FSE)-based  method. RESULTS: Displacement and rotation registration errors of 1.4 ± 0.4 mm  and 2.1 ± 0.2 (°) were obtained using USCT, resulting in sub-millimeter transmit  targeting errors driven at 306 kHz (0.9 ± 0.2 mm) and 612 kHz (0.9 ± 0.3 mm), and  source localization errors of 1.0 ± 0.3 mm and 0.6 ± 0.2 mm at receive  frequencies of 306 kHz and 612 kHz, respectively (mean ± SD). Similar errors were  obtained using LMCT and no significant differences between these two approaches  were found on either transmit (p = 0.64/0.99) or receive (p = 0.45/0.36) at 306  kHz/612kHz. During volumetric multi-point exposures, approximately 70% and 60% of  the transmit frames in which microbubble activity was detected via FSE were  recovered using USCT when imaging at the second-harmonic and half-harmonic,  respectively, compared to 60% and 69% using LMCT.

The aim of the study was to develop  an in vitro model to observe how the effects of sonothrombolysis change in the  case where a tissue-mimicking material (TMM) is placed in the path of the US beam  before the clot. METHODS: Fully retracted blood clots were prepared and pulse  sonicated for 1 h under various conditions. The system was in a state of real  circulating flow with a branch of an open bypass and an occluded tube containing  a blood clot, thus mimicking the case of ischemic stroke. The effectiveness of  thrombolysis was quantified in milligrams of clots removed. An agar-based TMM was  developed around the occluded tube. RESULTS: The clot breakdown in a TMM was  found to be more pronounced than in water, presumably due to the retention of the  acoustic field. A higher level of acoustic power was required to initiate clot  lysis (>76 W acoustic power) using only focused US (FUS). The greatest  thrombolysis enhancement was observed with the largest chosen pulse duration (PD)  and the use of MBs (150 mg clot mass lysis). The synergistic effect of FUS in  combination with MBs on the enzymatic fibrinolysis enhanced thrombolysis efficacy  by 260% compared to thrombolysis induced using only FUS. A reduction in the  degree of clot lysis was detected due to the attenuation factor of the  intervening material (30 mg at 1 and 4 ms PD). CONCLUSION: In vitro thrombolytic  models including a TMM can provide a more realistic evaluation of new  thrombolytic protocols. However, higher acoustic power should be considered to  compensate for the attenuation factor. The rate of clot lysis is slow and the  clinical use of this method will be challenging.","2023-09","2024-03-06 17:02:13","2024-03-06T17:02:13Z","","211-217","","3","31","","J Med Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright: © 2022 Journal of Medical Ultrasound.","","","","","","Place: India PMID: 38025011  PMCID: PMC10668898","","","","Focused ultrasound; microbubbles; stroke; thrombolytic agent; tissue-mimicking material","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PURPOSE: To devise and investigate a  deployable applicator suitable for minimally-invasive delivery of therapeutic  ultrasound, consisting of a 2D cylindrical sectored-ring ultrasound phased array,  integrated within an expandable paraboloid-shaped balloon-based reflector. The  balloon can be collapsed for compact delivery and expanded close to the target  position to mimic a larger-diameter concentric-ring sector-vortex array for  enhanced dynamic control of focal depth and volume. METHODS: Acoustic and  biothermal simulations were employed in 3D generalized homogeneous and  patient-specific heterogeneous models, for three-phased array transducers with  32, 64, and 128 elements, composed of sectored 4, 8, and 16 tubular ring  transducers, respectively. The applicator performance was characterized as a  function of array configuration, focal depth, phasing modes, and balloon  reflector geometry. A 16-element proof-of-concept phased array applicator  assembly, consisting of four tubular transducers each divided into four sectors,  was fabricated, and characterized with hydrophone measurements along and across  the axis, and ablations in ex vivo tissue. RESULTS: Simulation results indicated  that transducer arrays (1.5 MHz, 9 mm OD × 20 mm long), balloon sizes (41-50 mm  expanded diameter, 20-60 mm focal depth), phasing mode (0-4) and sonication  duration (30 s) can produce spatially localized acoustic intensity focal patterns  (focal length: 3-22 mm, focal width: 0.7-8.7 mm) and ablative thermal lesions  (width: 2.7-16 mm, length: 6-46 mm) in pancreatic tissue across a 10-90 mm focal  depth range. Patient-specific studies indicated that 0.1, 0.46, and 1.2 cm(3)  volume of tumor can be ablated in the body of the pancreas for 120 s sonications  using a single axial focus (Mode 0), or four, and eight simultaneous foci in a  toroidal pattern (Mode 2 and 4, respectively). Hydrophone measurements  demonstrated good agreement with simulation. Experiments in which chicken meat  was thermally ablated indicated that volumetric ablation can be produced using  single or multiple foci. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated the  feasibility of a novel compact ultrasound applicator design capable of focusing,  deep penetration, electronic steering, and volumetric thermal ablation. The  proposed applicator can be used for compact endoluminal or laparoscopic delivery  of localized ultrasound energy to deep-seated targets.","2023-01","2024-03-06 17:02:11","2024-03-06T17:02:11Z","","1-19","","1","50","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

However, existing FUS devices for preclinical research are expensive, bulky, and  lack the precision needed for small animal research, which limits the broad  adoption of this promising technique by the research community. Our objective was  to design and fabricate an affordable, easy-to-use, high-precision FUS device for  small animal research. METHODS: We designed and fabricated in-house mini-FUS  transducers (~$80 each in material cost) with three frequencies (1.5, 3.0, and  6.0 MHz) and integrated them with a stereotactic frame for precise mouse brain  targeting using established stereotactic procedures. The BBB opening volume by  FUS-BBBO at different acoustic pressures (0.20-0.57 MPa) was quantified using  T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of gadolinium leakage  and fluorescence imaging of Evans blue extravasation. RESULTS: The targeting  accuracy of the device as measured by the offset between the desired target  location and the centroid of BBBO was 0.63 ± 0.19 mm. The spatial precision of  the device in targeting individual brain structures was improved by the use of  higher frequency FUS transducers. The BBB opening volume had high linear  correlations with the cavitation index (defined by the ratio between acoustic  pressure and frequency) and mechanical index (defined by the ratio between  acoustic pressure and the square root of frequency). The correlation coefficient  of cavitation index was higher than that of the mechanical index. CONCLUSION:  This study demonstrated that spatially accurate and precise BBB opening was  achievable using an affordable and easy-to-use FUS device. The BBB opening volume  was tunable by modulating the cavitation index. This device is expected to  decrease the barriers for the adoption of FUS-BBBO technique by the broad  research community.","2022-02-14","2024-03-06 17:02:07","2024-03-06T17:02:07Z","","","","","PP","","IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35157574","","","","*Blood-Brain Barrier/diagnostic imaging; *Microbubbles; Animals; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Drug Delivery Systems/methods; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Mice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS:  Seven patients with intractable essential tremors and seven age-matched healthy  controls were enrolled in the study. The tremor score in essential tremor  patients was assessed, and rs-fMRIs and DTIs were acquired before and 3 months  after left ventral intermediate nucleus thalamotomy using FUS. RESULTS: There was  a significant improvement in the tremor of the right hand after FUS thalamotomy.  Seed-based functional connectivity analysis revealed a significant increase in  functional connectivity between the left thalamus and the caudal part of the  dorsal premotor cortex after FUS thalamotomy. Structural connectivity analysis  did not detect statistically significant changes between before and after FUS.  There was no correlation between the changes in functional connectivity and  tremor score. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of cases is small, our results  show that functional connectivity between the thalamus and the premotor cortex  increases after the amelioration of tremors by FUS thalamotomy. The lack of  correlation between increased functional connectivity and clinical tremor scores  suggests that the observed increase in functional connectivity may be a  compensatory change in the secondary sensorimotor changes that occur after  thalamotomy.","2022-05-31","2024-03-06 17:02:04","2024-03-06T17:02:04Z","","S1878-8750(22)00753-7","","","","","World Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

One of the challenges for tFUS  is the disruption of wave propagation through the skull. Consequently, despite  the risks associated with exposure to ionizing radiation, computed tomography  (CT) is required to estimate the acoustic transmission through the skull. This  study aims to generate synthetic CT (sCT) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI) and investigate its applicability to tFUS acoustic simulation. We  trained a 3D conditional generative adversarial network (3D-cGAN) with 15  subjects. We then assessed image quality with 15 test subjects: mean absolute  error (MAE) = 85.72±9.50 HU (head) and 280.25±24.02 HU (skull), dice coefficient  similarity (DSC) = 0.88±0.02 (skull). In terms of skull density ratio (SDR) and  skull thickness (ST), no significant difference was found between sCT and real CT  (rCT). When the acoustic simulation results of rCT and sCT were compared, the  intracranial peak acoustic pressure ratio was found to be less than 4%, and the  distance between focal points less than 1 mm.","2022-01","2024-03-06 17:01:52","2024-03-06T17:01:52Z","","161-171","","1","26","","IEEE J Biomed Health Inform","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34388098","","","","*Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; *Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods; Acoustics; Computer Simulation; Humans; Skull/diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transcranial ultrasound has been used for remotely mediated  surgeries, transient opening of the blood-brain barrier, local drug delivery, and  neuromodulation. However, all applications have been limited by the severe  attenuation and phase distortion of ultrasound by the skull. Here, we  characterized the dependence of the aberrations on specific anatomical segments  of the skull. In particular, we measured ultrasound propagation properties  throughout the perimeter of intact human skulls at 500 kHz. We found that the  parietal bone provides substantially higher transmission (average pressure  transmission 31 ± 7%) and smaller phase distortion (242 ± 44 degrees) than  frontal (13 ± 2%, 425 ± 47 degrees) and occipital bone regions (16 ± 4%, 416 ± 35  degrees). In addition, we found that across skull regions, transmission strongly  anti-correlated (R=-0.79) and phase distortion correlated (R=0.85) with skull  thickness.

This study aims at estimating the therapeutic beam  path at the pre-treatment stage to guide the therapeutic procedure. METHODS: An  incident beam mapping technique using passive beamforming was proposed based on a  clinical HIFU system and an ultrasound imaging research system. An optimization  model was created to map the cross-like beam pattern by maximizing the total  energy within the mapped area. This beam mapping technique was validated by  comparing the estimated focal region with the HIFU-induced actual focal region  (damaged region) through simulation, in-vitro, ex-vivo and in-vivo experiments.  RESULTS: The results of this study showed that the proposed technique was, to a  large extent, tolerant of sound speed inhomogeneities, being able to estimate the  focal location with errors of 0.15 mm and 0.93 mm under in-vitro and ex-vivo  situations respectively, and slightly over 1 mm under the in-vivo situation. It  should be noted that the corresponding errors were 6.8 mm, 3.2 mm, and 9.9 mm  respectively when the conventional geometrical method was used.

A method using micro-capsulated  thermochromic liquid crystal (MTLC) to evaluate the temperature distribution in  the media during HIFU exposure has been previously developed. However, the  color-coded temperature range of commercial MTLC is approximately 10 °C, which is  insufficient for temperature measurement for HIFU exposure. We created two layers  of tissue-mimicking phantoms with different color-coded temperature ranges, and a  new visualization method was developed by utilizing the axisymmetric pressure  distribution of a HIFU focus. METHODS: A two-layer phantom with two sensitivity  ranges was created. The HIFU transducer was set to align the focal point to the  boundary between the two layers. Images of the upper and lower layers were  flipped along the boundary between the two layers such that they overlapped with  each other, assuming the pressure distribution of HIFU to be axisymmetric.  RESULTS: The experimental and simulation results were compared to evaluate the  accuracy of the phantom temperature measurement. The experimental time profile of  the temperature and spatial distribution around the HIFU focus matched well with  that of the simulation. However, there is room for improvement in the accuracy in  the axial direction of HIFU focus.

METHODS: We conducted a  time-driven activity-based costing (TD-ABC) of MR-HIFU treatments for CIBP from a  hospital perspective. A European care-pathway (including a macro-, meso-, and  micro-level) was designed to incorporate the care-delivery value chain.

The objective of this work  was to construct an ultrasound system for multitarget neuromodulation in small  animals. First, a miniaturized high-powered 2-D array transducer was developed.  The phase delay of each array element was calculated based on the multifocal  time-reversal method, generating multiple foci simultaneously in a 3-D field. The  effects of the axial focal length, interfocus spacing (lateral distance between  the two focal centers), and the number of foci on the focal properties of the  pressure field were examined through numerical simulations. In-vitro ultrasonic  measurements and transcranial simulations on a rat skull were conducted. The  minimum interfocus spacing separating two -6-dB foci and the peak full-width at  half-maximum were positively correlated with axial focal length; the relative  relationship between the interfocus spacing and pressure field properties was  similar for each axial focal length. The maximum acoustic pressure and spatial  average intensity at focus in deionized water were 2.21 MPa and 133 W/cm(2),  respectively. The simulated and experimental results were compared, demonstrating  agreement in both peak position and focus shape.

It can result in  clotting of blood within the ventricles, which causes a buildup of cerebrospinal  fluid that can lead to posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation and posthemorrhagic  hydrocephalus. Currently, there are no direct treatments for these blood clots as  the standard of care is invasive surgery to insert a shunt. Magnetic  resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) has been  investigated as a noninvasive treatment to lyse blood clots. However, current  MRgHIFU systems are not suitable in the context of treating IVH in neonates.  PURPOSE: We have developed a robotic MRgHIFU neurosurgical platform designed to  treat the neonatal brain. This platform facilitates ergonomic patient positioning  and directs treatment through their open anterior fontanelle while providing a  larger treatment volume. The platform is based on an MR-compatible robot  developed by our group. Further development of the platform has warranted  investigation of its targeting ability to assess its feasibility in the neonatal  brain. This study aimed to quantify the platform's targeting accuracy, precision,  and repeatability using a brain phantom and clinical MRI system. METHODS: A  thermosensitive brain-mimicking phantom was developed to test the platform's  targeting accuracy. Rectangular grid patterns were created with HIFU thermal  energy ""lesions"" in the phantoms by targeting specific coordinate points. The  intended target locations were demarcated by inserting carbon fiber rods through  a targeting assessment template. Coordinates for the intended and actual targets  were derived from T2-weighted MRI scans, and the centroid distance between them  was measured. Subsequently, the platform's targeting accuracy was quantified  according to equations derived from ISO Standard 9283:1998. RESULTS: HIFU  ablation resulted in distinct thermal lesions within the thermosensitive  phantoms, which appeared as discrete hypointense regions in T2-weighted MR scans.  A total of 127 target points were included in the data analysis, which yielded a  targeting accuracy of 0.6 mm and targeting precision of 1.2 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The  robotic MRgHIFU platform was shown to have a high degree of accuracy, precision,  and repeatability. The results demonstrate the platform's functionality when  targeting through simulated brain matter. These results serve as an initial  verification of the platform targeting ability and showed promise toward the  final application in a neonatal brain.","2022-04","2024-03-06 17:01:36","2024-03-06T17:01:36Z","","2120-2135","","4","49","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35174892","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Neurosurgery; *Robotic Surgical Procedures; *Robotics; Brain/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; focused ultrasound; hydrocephalus; magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound; neurosurgical robotics; thermosensitive brain-mimicking phantoms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method was used to fabricate a 750 kHz truncated circular  aperture array (165 x 234 mm) transducer with a focal length of 142 mm. The  aperture was segmented into 260 arc-shaped modular elements, each approximately  11.5 mm x 11.5 mm, arranged in concentric rings. The resulting aperture  utilization was 92%. The FWHM focal zone of the array was measured to be 1.6 x  1.1 x 4.5 mm, and the FWHM electrical steering range was measured to be 38.5 x 33  x >40 mm. The array was estimated to be capable of generating approximately 120  MPa peak negative pressure at the geometric focus. Additionally, the array was  used to ablate a 5 cm3 volume of tissue with electric focal steering.","2022-05-26","2024-03-06 17:01:21","2024-03-06T17:01:21Z","","","","","PP","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35617178","","","","*Ultrasonic Therapy/methods; Transducers; Water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If  bowels are in the pathway of sonication path, firstly filling the bladder, then  filling the rectum, and emptying the bladder subsequently can be used to avoid  them in recent research. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the  modified bowel displacement technique (rectal filling first and then bladder  filling, with or without subsequent bladder emptying) was feasible to create  secure acoustic window. METHODS: A total of 78 patients who had undergone MRgFUS  treatment for uterine fibroids and adenomyosis from January 2020 to November 2020  were included in this retrospective study. Of the 78 patients, 19 patients were  treated using a modified bowel displacement technique, whereas the rest of the  patients did not require intestinal displacement. High-intensity focused  ultrasound was performed using GE Sightec HDXT 1.5 Tesla MR and ExAblate  high-intensity focused ultrasound system. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients requiring  bowel displacement techniques, 17 patients successfully completed MRgFUS surgery.  Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery was feasible in 4  patients after rectal filling, bladder filling, and subsequent bladder emptying.  The others received ablation through the extended bladder because of bowel  descending after emptying the bladder. The surgery caused no intestinal or  uterine complications and no serious discomfort to the patient. CONCLUSIONS: The  modified bowel displacement technique was effective in displacing interposed  bowels during MRgFUS treatment to create safe acoustic pathway for ablating  uterine fibroids and adenomyosis.","2022-06-01","2024-03-06 17:01:20","2024-03-06T17:01:20Z","","379-382","","3","46","","J Comput Assist Tomogr","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

METHODS: A  literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane databases, in  accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The Odds Ratio, Weighted Mean Difference,  and 95% Confidence Interval were evaluated by means of the Random-Effects model.  RESULTS: Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria, incorporating 939  patients. This study reveals that patients in the HIFU group presented increased  median overall survival (OS), along with higher OS at 6 and 12 months after  treatment compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, patients  treated with HIFU in conjunction with chemotherapy presented reduced levels of  pain (p < 0.05) compared to the traditional treatment group. In addition, HIFU  contributed to significant tumor responsiveness, in terms of CA19-9 reduction  (p < 0.05). Finally, HIFU was a considerably safe treatment modality with a low  incidence of complications. CONCLUSION: These outcomes suggest that HIFU is a  feasible and safe treatment modality for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer  and provides enhanced outcomes regarding survival and quality of life. Given the  lack of a significant number of randomized clinical trials, this meta-analysis  represents the best currently available evidence.

METHODS: A panel of gynecologists, nurses, and patient-reported outcome  (PRO) experts created a draft of the PASM-UF scale. Women who underwent FUAS for  uterine fibroids were recruited for its psychometric validation. Assessments were  conducted during admission, before surgery, and at discharge. The Symptom  Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was administered to assess criterion validity. We assessed  the relationship between the developed PASM-UF and the SCL-90 via a correlation  analysis. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess internal consistency for  reliability. RESULTS: We included five items, pain, lack of appetite, fatigue  (tiredness), disturbed sleep, and anxiety, in the final version of the PASM-UF.  Data were collected from 228 patients. Cronbach's alpha was 0.745, whereas the  correlation coefficient between SCL-90 and PASM-UF was 0.345 (p < 0.001). The  total PASM-UF scores were significantly higher in patients whose SCL-90 scores  were ≥160 compared to those with <160 (9.85 ± 9.07 vs. 4.01 ± 5.15, p = .002).  Those who did not complete the SCL-90 reported lower PASM-UF scores than those  who did (2.33 ± 3.27 vs. 4.67 ± 5.99, p = .006). Patients reported significantly  lower PASM-UF scores postoperatively than preoperatively (2.95 ± 4.18 vs.  3.92 ± 4.90, p = .002).

To overcome this obstacle, one common solution is to catalyze the  conversion of endogenous H(2)O(2) into O(2). However, the effectiveness of this  strategy is limited by the insufficient concentration of H(2)O(2) in the tumor  microenvironment (TME). Herein, we developed a H(2)O(2) economizer for on-demand  O(2) supply and sonosensitizer-mediated reactive oxygen species production during  ultrasound activation, thereby alleviating hypoxia-associated limitations and  augmenting the efficacy of sonodynamic immunotherapy. Methods: The H(2)O(2)  economizer is constructed by electrostatic adsorption and π-π interactions  between the Fe-doped polydiaminopyridine (Fe-PDAP) nanozyme and chlorin e6. By  employing a biomimetic engineering strategy with cancer cell membranes, we  addressed the premature leakage issue and increased tumor-site accumulation of  nanoparticles (membrane-coated Fe-PDAP/Ce6, MFC). Results: The prepared MFC could  significantly attenuate the catalytic activity of Fe-PDAP by reducing their  contact with H(2)O(2). Ultrasound irradiation promoted MFC dissociation and the  exposure of Fe-PDAP for a more robust O(2) supply. Moreover, the combination of  MFC-enhanced sonodynamic therapy with anti-programmed cell death protein-1  antibody (aPD-1) immune checkpoint blockade induced a strong antitumor response  against both primary tumors and distant tumors. Conclusion: This as-prepared  H(2)O(2) economizer significantly alleviates tumor hypoxia via reducing H(2)O(2)  expenditure and that on-demand oxygen-elevated sonodynamic immunotherapy can  effectively combat tumors.","2022","2024-03-06 17:01:15","2024-03-06T17:01:15Z","","59-75","","1","12","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","eng","© The author(s).","","","","","","PMID: 34987634  PMCID: PMC8690934","","","","*Tumor Microenvironment; *cancer cell membrane; *focused ultrasound; *immunotherapy; *nanozyme; *sonodynamic therapy; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide/*therapeutic use; Immunotherapy/*methods; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Nanoparticles; Neoplasms/*therapy; Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism; Tumor Hypoxia; Ultrasonic Therapy/*methods; cancer cell membrane; focused ultrasound; immunotherapy; nanozyme; sonodynamic therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PURPOSE: We have  developed a new type of drug-loaded microbubble complex based on  poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) that targets gambogic acid (GA) to the area  of brain tumors through UTMD. METHODS: GA/PLGA nanoparticles were prepared by the  double emulsification method, and cationic microbubbles (CMBs) were prepared by a  thin film hydration method. The GA/PLGA-CMB microbubble complex was assembled  through electrostatic attractions and was characterized chemically. The  anti-glioblastoma effect of GA/PLGA-CMB combined with focused ultrasound (FUS)  was evaluated by biochemical and imaging assays in cultured cells and model mice.  RESULTS: GA/PLGA-CMB combined with FUS demonstrated a significant inhibitory  effect on glioblastoma cell lines U87 and U251 as compared with controls  (P<0.05).

However,  limited evidence suggests that, although cytokines are influenced by thermal  necrosis, there is still no cytokine threshold for clinical responses. A  prediction model to approximate the postablation immune status on the basis of  circulating cytokine activation is thus needed. IL-6 and IP-10, which are  proinflammatory cytokines, decreased significantly during the acute phase.  Wound-healing cytokines such as VEGF and PDGF increased after ablation, but the  increase was not statistically significant. In this phase, IL-6, IL-13, IP-10,  and eotaxin expression levels diminished the ongoing inflammatory progression in  the treated sites. These cytokine changes also correlated with the response rate  of primary tumor control after acute periods. The few-shot learning algorithm was  applied to test the correlation between cytokine levels and local control (p =  0.036). The best-fitted model included IL-6, IL-13, IP-10, and eotaxin as  cytokine parameters from the few-shot selection, and had an accuracy of 85.2%,  sensitivity of 88.6%, and AUC of 0.95. The acceptable usage of this model may  help predict the acute-phase prognosis of a patient with painful bone metastasis  who underwent local MRgFUS. The application of machine learning in bone  metastasis is equivalent or better than the current logistic regression.","2022-01-17","2024-03-06 17:01:12","2024-03-06T17:01:12Z","","","","2","14","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 35053608  PMCID: PMC8773927","","","","HIFU; bone metastasis; machine learning; magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery; prognosis prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To compare the pain perception during the  MFU-V procedure between two pain reduction methods (topical anesthesia alone  versus combined topical anesthesia with forced air cooling). MATERIALS AND  METHODS: This was a prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. A  square area on the inner side of both arms of healthy volunteers was marked as an  experimental site and randomly assigned to receive each pain reduction method:  topical anesthesia or combined topical anesthesia with forced air cooling.  Thereafter, MFU-V was performed with a 4.5 MHz, 4.5 mm transducer (10 lines,  0.9 J) followed by a 7 MHz, 3.0 mm transducer (10 lines, 0.3 J). The visual  analog scale (VAS) for pain was measured immediately after 4.5 mm transducer  (T1a), immediately after 3.0 mm transducer (T1b), and after the entire procedure  (T2). RESULTS: Twenty-one participants with a mean (SD) age of 34.67 (±6.18)  years were enrolled. The mean (±SD) pain score of combined topical anesthesia  with forced air cooling-treated area was 5.40 (±1.64), 4.80 (±1.63), and 5.40  (±1.56) at T1a, T1b, and T2, respectively. The mean pain score for topical  anesthesia-treated areas was 5.89 (±1.45), 5.00 (±1.72), and 5.76 (±1.67) at T1a,  T1b, and T2, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in  the pain perception between the two methods. CONCLUSION: The addition of forced  air cooling is not beneficial for pain reduction during the MFU-V procedure  because its temperature reduction effect cannot be delivered to the deep parts of  the skin, which is the target site of MFU-V.","2023-04","2024-03-06 17:01:00","2024-03-06T17:01:00Z","","1279-1285","","4","22","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center prospective  study was carried out on 12 patients with symptomatic BM treated with MRI-guided  focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU). The primary endpoint was the effectiveness of  MR-HIFU in reducing current and breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) scores. The main  secondary aims were the evaluation of circulating markers at different  time-points and their relation to pain and procedure efficacy. Other secondary  objectives included temporal evolution of pain response, evaluation of QoL, and  side effects of the treatment. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate  primary and secondary endpoints. Questionnaires on pain and QoL completed at  baseline and at 30 days were compared using appropriate statistical tests with  exploratory intent. RESULTS: MR-HIFU was successfully completed in all 12  patients enrolled between September 2015 and December 2018. On day 30, 6 (50.0%)  patients showed a complete response of current pain and 6 a partial response,  while 5 (41.7%) obtained a complete BTCP response. A partial response of BM  evaluated by MD Anderson criteria was obtained in 9 (81.8%) patients. Only one  patient progressed in the target lesion after MR-HIFU. No treatment-related  adverse events were recorded. Bone turnover markers CTX/RANK-L (P) do not  demonstrate any significant change with the pain or BM response. CONCLUSION: In  our patients, targeted therapy of painful BM with MRI-guided focused ultrasound  ablation was safe and showed encouraging early-onset and functional results.","2022-07","2024-03-06 17:00:55","2024-03-06T17:00:55Z","","5737-5745","","7","30","","Support Care Cancer","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Mechanical ablation  and histotripsy use short and intense acoustic pulses to destroy the tissue via a  purely mechanical effect. Here, we show that coupled with low-frequency excitation,  targeted microbubbles can serve as mechanical therapeutic warheads that trigger  potent mechanical effects in tumors using focused ultrasound. Upon low frequency  excitation (250 kHz and below), high amplitude microbubble oscillations occur at  substantially lower pressures as compared to higher MHz ultrasonic frequencies. For  example, inertial cavitation was initiated at a pressure of 75 kPa for a center  frequency of 80 kHz. Low frequency insonation of targeted microbubbles was then used  to achieve low energy tumor cell fractionation at pressures below a mechanical index  of 1.9, and in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration guidelines. We  demonstrate these capabilities in vitro and in vivo. In cell cultures, cell  viability was reduced to 16% at a peak negative pressure of 800 kPa at the 250 kHz  frequency (mechanical index of 1.6) and to 10% at a peak negative pressure of 250  kPa at a frequency of 80 kHz (mechanical index of 0.9). Following an intratumoral  injection of targeted microbubbles into tumor-bearing mice, and coupled with low  frequency ultrasound application, significant tumor debulking and cancer cell death  was observed. Our findings suggest that reducing the center frequency enhances  microbubble-mediated mechanical ablation; thus, this technology provides a unique  theranostic platform for safe low energy tumor fractionation, while reducing  off-target effects.","2021-07-19","2024-03-06 17:00:06","2024-03-06T17:00:06Z","","","","","","","Bioconjug Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34280311","","","","*Microbubbles; *Neoplasms; Acoustics; Animals; Cell Survival; Mice; Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Radical treatment with curative intent provides good oncological results for  PCa survivors, although definitive therapy is associated with significant number of  serious side-effects. In modern-era of medicine tissue-sparing techniques, such as  focal HIFU, have been proposed for PCa patients in order to provide cancer control  equivalent to the standard-of-care procedures while reducing morbidities and  complications. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise the available  evidence about focal HIFU therapy as a primary treatment for localized PCa. MATERIAL  AND METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review of focal HIFU therapy in  the MEDLINE database (PROSPERO: CRD42021235581). Articles published in the English  language between 2010 and 2020 with more than 50 patients were included. RESULTS:  Clinically significant in-field recurrence and out-of-field progression were  detected to 22% and 29% PCa patients, respectively. Higher ISUP grade group, more  positive cores at biopsy and bilateral disease were identified as the main risk  factors for disease recurrence. The most common strategy for recurrence management  was definitive therapy. Six months after focal HIFU therapy 98% of patients were  totally continent and 80% of patients retained sufficient erections for sexual  intercourse. The majority of complications presented in the early postoperative  period and were classified as low-grade. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights that  focal HIFU therapy appears to be a safe procedure, while short-term cancer control  rate is encouraging. Though, second-line treatment or active surveillance seems to  be necessary in a significant number of patients.","2021-04-20","2024-03-06 17:00:05","2024-03-06T17:00:05Z","","","","","47","","Int Braz J Urol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright® by the International Brazilian Journal of Urology.","","","","","","Place: Brazil PMID: 34003610","","","","*Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology/surgery; *Ultrasound, High-Intensity Focused, Transrectal/methods; High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; Humans; Male; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/surgery; Prostate cancer, familial [Supplementary Concept]; Salvage Therapy/methods; Technology; complications [Subheading]; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bio","","2590-0064","10.1016/j.mtbio.2022.100223","","Inflammatory arthritis is a major cause of disability in the elderly. This condition causes joint pain, loss of function, and deterioration of quality of  life, mainly due to osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Currently,  available treatment options for inflammatory arthritis include anti-inflammatory  medications administered via oral, topical, or intra-articular routes, surgery,  and physical rehabilitation. Novel alternative approaches to managing  inflammatory arthritis, so far, remain the grand challenge owing to catastrophic  financial burden and insignificant therapeutic benefit. In the view of  non-targeted systemic cytotoxicity and limited bioavailability of drug therapies,  a major concern is to establish stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems using  nanomaterials with on-off switching potential for biomedical applications. This  review summarizes the advanced applications of triggerable nanomaterials  dependent on various internal stimuli (including reduction-oxidation (redox), pH,  and enzymes) and external stimuli (including temperature, ultrasound (US),  magnetic, photo, voltage, and mechanical friction). The review also explores the  progress and challenges with the use of stimuli-responsive nanomaterials to  manage inflammatory arthritis based on pathological changes, including cartilage  degeneration, synovitis, and subchondral bone destruction. Exposure to  appropriate stimuli induced by such histopathological alterations can trigger the  release of therapeutic medications, imperative in the joint-targeted treatment of  inflammatory arthritis.","2022-03","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","100223","","","14","","Mater Today Bio","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35243298  PMCID: PMC8881671","","","","ACLT, anterior cruciate ligament transection; ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; AIA, adjuvant-induced arthritis; AMF, alternating magnetic field; APCs, antigen-presenting cells; BBR, berberine; CAT, catalase; CD44, cluster of differentiation 44; CEL, tripterine; CEL-PRNPs, RGD-modified PLGA enzyme-responsive nanoparticles loaded with tripterine; CIA, collagen-induced arthritis; CTSK, cathepsin K; CaP, calcium phosphate; Cartilage degeneration; DCF, diclofenac; DEX-P, dexamethasone sodium phosphate; DMARDs, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs; DMM, destabilization of medial meniscus; Dex/Oxi-α CDNPs, 4-phenylborate-cyclodextrin biomaterial loaded with dexamethasone; ECM, extracellular matrix; ELP, elastin-like peptide; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; FLSS, fibroblast synovial cells; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; GSH, glutathione; HA, hyaluronic acid; HIFU, high intensity focused ultrasound; HM, hollow microsphere; IBU, ibuprofen; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IL, interleukin; IL-1Ra, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist; Inflammatory arthritis; K/BxN, the T cell receptor transgene KRN and the MHC class II molecule; KAFAK, KAFAKLAARLYRKALARQLGVAA; KGN, kartogenin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MFGCN, methotrexate-loaded folate-conjugated glycol chitosan nanoparticles; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; MNPs, multifunctional nanoparticles; MOF, metal-organic framework; MP-HANPs, mineralized nanoparticles; MPEG-PPF, methoxy polyethylene glycol-polypropylene fumarate; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; MTX, methotrexate; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NFATc1, nuclear factor of activated T cell cytoplasmic 1; NGPEGSS, nanoparticles with degradable disulfide crosslinks; NIR, near-infrared; NO, nitric oxide; NP, nanoparticle; NP-gel, nanoparticle-hydrogel hybrid system; NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; OA, osteoarthritis; P-HA, polyethylene glycol hyaluronic acid; PAMAM, poly (Ninylisobutyramide); PCA, protocatechuic acid; PDEPT, pre-enzyme drug therapy; PDT, photodynamic therapy; PEG-PLGA-Au, polyethylene-glycol polylactic-glycolic acid gold-containing nanoparticles; PEOx-PPOy-PEOz, poly (ethylene oxide)-block-poly (Oxypropylene)-block-poly (ethylene oxide); PEVS, platelet-derived extracellular vesicles; PICsomes, polyion complex vesicles; PLCG1, phospholipase C gamma 1; PLGA, polylactic-glycolic acid; PMEOMA, poly [2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethylmethacrylate]; PNC, bisphosphonate-modified nanocellulose; PNIPAM, poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide); PON1, paraoxonase-1; POxs, poly (2-oxazoline); PPS, polyphenylene sulfide; PTH, parathyroid hormone; PTT, photothermal therapy; Q, a tripeptide sequence QAW; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; RANKL, nuclear factor-kappa B ligand; RFA, radiofrequency thermal ablation; RGD, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid; RMTQ, RGD-MMP-TAT-QAW peptide; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Redox, reduction-oxidation; SBC, sodium bicarbonate; SOD, superoxide dismutase; SPION, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles; Stimuli-responsive drug delivery system; Subchondral bone destruction; Synovitis; T cell, thymus cell; T, cell-penetrating peptide; TA, triamcinolone acetonide; TAT, transcription-transactivating; TATQ, TAT-QAW; TG-18, triglycerol monostearate; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TR1, type 1 regulatory; TolDex, tolerogenic dendritic cell-derived exosomes; US, ultrasound; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; fMRI, focusing magnetic resonance imaging; β-TCP, β-tricalcium phosphate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this review  was to analyze the efficacy of uterine-preserving, minimally invasive treatment  modalities in reducing fibroid-related bleeding. A comprehensive search was  conducted of PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, Scopus, and Cochrane  Library databases from inception to July 2020. English-language publications that  evaluated premenopausal women with fibroid-related bleeding symptoms before and  after treatment were considered. Randomized controlled trials were assessed for  bias with the established Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0 and observational  studies were assessed for quality under the New Castle-Ottawa Scale guidelines.  Eighty-four studies were included in the review, including 10 randomized  controlled trials and 74 observational studies. Six studies on myomectomy  demonstrated overall bleeding symptom improvement in up to 95.9% of patients,  though there was no significant difference between mode of myomectomy. Forty-one  studies on uterine artery embolization reported significant reduction of  fibroid-related bleeding, with symptomatic improvement in 79 to 98.5% of  patients. Three studies suggested that embolization may be superior to myomectomy  in reducing fibroid-related bleeding. Six studies reported that laparoscopic  uterine artery occlusion combined with myomectomy led to greater reduction of  bleeding than myomectomy alone. Fifteen studies demonstrated significantly  reduced bleeding severity after radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Additional  research is needed to establish the superiority of these modalities over one  another. Long-term evidence is limited in current literature for magnetic  resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery, cryomyolysis, microwave ablation,  and laser ablation.","2022-10","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2786-2809","","10","29","","Reprod Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

This study aimed to evaluate the  association between focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) and early administration  of diuretics in patients with acute HF admitted to the ED. METHODS: This  retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary academic hospital.  Patients with acute HF patients who were admitted to the ED and receiving  intravenous medication between January 2018 and December 2019 were enrolled. The  main exposure was a FoCUS examination performed within 2 h of ED triage. The  primary outcome was the time to furosemide administration. RESULTS: Of 1154  patients with acute HF, 787 were included in the study, with 116 of them having  undergone FoCUS. The time to furosemide was significantly shorter in the FoCUS  group (median time (q1-q3), 112 min; range, 65-163 min) compared to the non-FoCUS  group (median time, 131 min; range, 71-229 min). In the multivariable logistic  regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, chief complaint, mode of arrival,  triage level, shock status, and desaturation at triage, early administration of  furosemide within 2 h from triage was significantly higher in the FoCUS group  (adjusted odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence intervals, 1.04-2.55) than in the  non-FoCUS group. CONCLUSIONS: Early administration of intravenous furosemide was  associated with FoCUS examination in patients with acute HF admitted to the ED.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the layered anatomy of the forehead soft tissues with  respect to their thicknesses and how they relate to different minimally-invasive  aesthetic treatments. METHODS: A total of n = 85 healthy study participants (69  females and 16 males) with a mean age of 40.84 ± 10.9 years and a mean body mass  index of 22.65 ± 2.6 kg/m(2) were investigated with ultrasound-based imaging to  measure the thickness of different forehead soft tissues.

Recently, the novel designation of ""ET-plus"" was proposed  to reclassify ET patients who demonstrate these non-tremor clinical features, but  the prevalence of ET-plus remains poorly defined. The primary aim of our study  was to estimate the prevalence of ET-plus among presurgical patients with ET by  applying this reclassification scheme. METHODS: We performed a retrospective  review of patients with ET being considered for deep brain stimulation or focused  ultrasound thalamotomy. Patient demographics and data from their clinical workups  were collected. As part of their clinical workup, patients were screened for  preexisting balance and cognitive impairment. Patients with ET were designated as  ET-plus if they had balance impairment, cognitive impairment, or tremor at rest.  We performed a series of Pearson correlations to examine how individual clinical  and demographic variables were related. RESULTS: We identified 92 patients who  met the study criteria. Our results indicate that 87% of the presurgical patients  in our cohort met the criteria for reclassification as ET-plus. In addition, we  observed robust correlations between patient age and balance impairment,  cognitive impairment, history of falls, family history of tremor, and ET-plus  reclassification. CONCLUSION: We propose that balance and gait impairment should  be assessed preoperatively alongside neuropsychological evaluation to improve the  counseling and treatment of patients with ET-plus.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","100134","","","6","","Clin Park Relat Disord","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Author(s).","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35146408  PMCID: PMC8802061","","","","Balance; Cognitive impairment; ET-plus; Essential tremor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The method is applied to focused ultrasound heating experiments  in a gelatin phantom and an ex vivo salt pork sample, without and with simulated  respiratory motion. RESULTS: In each experiment, phase variations due to B(0)  field drift and respiration were readily apparent in the measured phase  difference. With correction, the SD of the temperature over time was reduced from  0.18°C to 0.14°C (no breathing) and from 0.81°C to 0.22°C (with breathing) for  the gelatin phantom, and from 0.68°C to 0.13°C (no breathing) and from 1.06°C to  0.17°C (with breathing) for the pork sample. The accuracy in nonheated regions,  assessed as the RMS error deviation from 0°C, improved from 1.70°C to 1.11°C (no  breathing) and from 4.73°C to 1.47°C (with breathing) for the gelatin phantom,  and from 5.95°C to 0.88°C (no breathing) and from 13.40°C to 1.73°C (with  breathing) for the pork sample. The correction did not affect the temperature  measurement accuracy in the heated regions. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates  that phase changes resulting from variations in B(0) due to drift and  respiration, commonly seen in MR thermometry applications, can be measured  directly from 3D Cartesian acquisition methods. The correction of temporal field  variations using the presented technique improved temperature accuracy, reduced  variability in nonheated regions, and did not reduce accuracy in heated regions.","2022-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1098-1111","","3","88","","Magn Reson Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35576148","","","","*Gelatin; *Thermometry/methods; MRI field drift monitoring; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; PRF temperature phase correction; Phantoms, Imaging; Temperature; respiration monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Triptolide (T(10)) has been  reported as a potential autophagy inducer but limited by hepatotoxicity, low  solubility and rapid metabolism. In this study, a novel AHNAK-targeted  microbubbles integrated with T(10) (T(10)-AHNAK-MBs) was developed to alleviate  motor deficit in rAAV2/5-wild type and A53T mutant αSyn transfected PD mouse  model. AHNAK facilitated the accumulation of microbubbles (MBs) near the cerebral  vessel wall. Furthermore, bubble cavitation caused by focused-ultrasound (FUS)  exposure could simultaneously induce drug release and blood-brain-barrier opening  in the area of interest. The results of western blotting, thioflavin S staining,  immunofluorescence, ELISA and behavior test demonstrated that T(10)-AHNAK-MBs  with FUS exposure (T(10)-AHNAK-MBs-FUS) could significantly delivery more T(10)  into substantia nigra, promote clearance of various forms of αSyn, reduce  tyrosine hydroxylase positive neuron loss, restore dopamine secretion, and  eventually alleviate motor deficits, along with largely reduced adverse effects.  The analyses of autophagic markers suggested that autophagy lysosome pathway  (ALP) might dominate the T(10)-induced αSyn degeneration, including the oligomers  and pre-formed fibrils. Thus, T(10)-AHNAK-MBs-FUS constitutes a promising  strategy against the motor deficits in PD by promoting clearance of pathogenic  αSyn aggregates via inducing ALP.","2022-12-15","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","122351","","","629","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

This 'nanobomb' was rationally designed via the encapsulation of  indocyanine green (ICG) and perfluoropentane (PFP) into cRGD  peptide-functionalized nano-liposome. The resulting Lip-ICG-PFP-cRGD nanoparticle  linked with cRGD peptide could actively targeted ID8 and TC-1 cells and elicits  ROS-mediated apoptosis after triggered by low-intensity focused ultrasound  (LIFU). Moreover, the phase change of PFP (from droplets to microbubbles) under  LIFU irradiation can produce a large number of microbubbles, which act as  intra-tumoral bomber and can detonate explode tumor cells by acoustic cavitation  effect. Instant necrosis of tumor cells further induces the release of  biologically active damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to facilitate  antitumor immunity. More important, the 'nanobomb' in combination with  anti-PD-1checkpoint blockade therapy can significantly improve the antitumor  efficacy in a subcutaneous model. In addition, the liposomes may also be used as  an imaging probe for ultrasound (US) imaging after being irradiated with LIFU. In  summary, the US imaging-guided, LIFU activated ROS production and explosion  'nanobomb' might significantly improve the antitumor efficacy and overcome drug  resistance through combination of SDT and immunotherapy, we believe that this is  a promising approach for targeted therapy of solid tumor including ovarian  cancer.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2177-2189","","1","29","","Drug Deliv","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35815688  PMCID: PMC9291667","","","","*Nanoparticles/chemistry; *Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy; Acoustics; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Humans; Indocyanine Green/chemistry; Liposomes/chemistry; Microbubbles; Reactive Oxygen Species; Sonodynamic; Ultrasonography; cancer therapy; immunogenic cell death; nanobomb; reactive oxygen species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS AND  MATERIALS: The MAUDE database were queried for AEs associated with non-invasive  body contouring devices between January 2011 and June 2021. An extensive list of  keywords and brand and manufacturer names was used. RESULTS: A total of 1,325  reports with 1,590 AEs were identified among 6 modalities. More than 70% were  reported in the past 5 years. Cryolipolysis made up 38.3% reports, which mostly  pertained to paradoxical hyperplasia and hernias. Radiofrequency had the most  reports (41.9%). Like laser devices, most of their reports described burns.  Focused ultrasound was commonly associated with unintentional fat loss and  surface irregularities. Focused electromagnetic field resulted in only 7 reports.  CONCLUSION: The analysis of present study supports previous studies concerning  common local symptoms caused by these devices, but it also reveals complications  not reported in previous device studies. This study highlights the importance of  proper technique and adherence to device guidelines. Practitioners should be  knowledgeable of potential complications from each device to both prevent and  manage them accordingly.","2022-09-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","943-948","","9","48","","Dermatol Surg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, Inc.

Focused ultrasound applied together with  microbubbles (FUS(+MB)) is a novel technique to transiently open the BBB and  increase drug delivery. Evidence suggests that FUS(+MB) is safe, however, the  effects of FUS(+MB) on human BBB cells, especially in the context of AD, remain  sparsely investigated. In addition, there currently are no cell platforms to test  for FUS(+MB)-mediated drug delivery. Methods: Here we generated BBB cells  (induced brain endothelial-like cells (iBECs) and astrocytes (iAstrocytes)) from  apolipoprotein E gene allele E4 (APOE4, high sporadic AD risk) and allele E3  (APOE3, lower AD risk) carrying patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells  (iPSCs). We established mono- and co-culture models of human sporadic AD and  control BBB cells to investigate the effects of FUS(+MB) on BBB cell phenotype  and to screen for the delivery of two potentially therapeutic AD antibodies, an  Aducanumab-analogue (Aduhelm(TM); anti-amyloid-β) and a novel anti-Tau antibody,  RNF5. We then developed a novel hydrogel-based 2.5D BBB model as a step towards a  more physiologically relevant FUS(+MB) drug delivery platform. Results: When  compared to untreated cells, the delivery of Aducanumab-analogue and RNF5 was  significantly increased (up to 1.73 fold), across the Transwell-based BBB models  following FUS(+MB) treatment. Our results also demonstrated the safety of  FUS(+MB) indicated by minimal changes in iBEC transcriptome as well as little or  no changes in iBEC or iAstrocyte viability and inflammatory responses within the  first 24 h post FUS(+MB). Furthermore, we demonstrated successful iBEC barrier  formation in our novel 2.5D hydrogel-based BBB model with significantly increased  delivery (1.4 fold) of Aducanumab-analogue following FUS(+MB). Conclusion: Our  results demonstrate a robust and reproducible approach to utilize patient cells  for FUS(+MB)-mediated drug delivery screening in vitro. With such a cell platform  for FUS(+MB) research previously not reported, it has the potential to identify  novel FUS(+MB)-deliverable drugs as well as screen for cell- and patient-specific  effects of FUS(+MB), accelerating the use of FUS(+MB) as a therapeutic modality  in AD.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","6826-6847","","16","12","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","eng","© The author(s).","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 36276649  PMCID: PMC9576609","","","","*Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy; *Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage; *Blood-Brain Barrier; Aduhelm; Alzheimer's disease; Apolipoprotein E3/metabolism; Apolipoprotein E4/metabolism; Brain/physiology; Drug Delivery Systems/methods; Humans; Hydrogels; Microbubbles; blood-brain barrier; drug delivery; focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Percutaneous  ethanol ablation is now an accepted first-line treatment for recurring cystic  thyroid nodules. Thermal ablation techniques such as high-intensity focused  ultrasound, laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, and microwave ablation have  shown efficacy in producing a nodular volume reduction of greater than 50% that  is maintained for several years with resolution of local compressive symptoms.  There is also increasing evidence that these techniques can effectively treat  papillary thyroid microcarcinomas and recurrent metastatic lymph node disease.  Because these interventional ablation techniques are performed safely in an  outpatient setting, are well tolerated, and the risk for needing thyroid hormone  supplementation is negligible, they are becoming a popular alternative treatment  to surgical resection.

Quantitative tremor evaluation  is well-developed in research, but clinical application has lagged, in part due  to cumbersome mathematical application and lack of established standards.  OBJECTIVES: To develop a novel method for evaluating tremor that integrates a  standardized clinical exam, wrist-watch accelerometers, and a software framework  for data analysis that does not require advanced mathematical or computing  skills. The utility of the method was tested in a sequential cohort of patients  with predominant postural and action tremor presenting to a specialized surgical  clinic with the presumptive diagnosis of Essential Tremor (ET). METHODS:  Wristwatch accelerometry was integrated with a standardized clinical exam. A  MATLAB application was developed for automated data analysis and graphical  representation of tremor. Measures from the power spectrum of acceleration of  tremor in different upper limb postures were derived in 25 consecutive patients.  The linear results from accelerometry were correlated with the commonly used  non-linear Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST). RESULTS: The acceleration  power spectrum was reliably produced in all consecutive patients. Tremor  frequency was stable in different postures and across patients. Both total and  peak power of acceleration during postural conditions correlated well with the  CRST. The standardized clinical examination with integrated accelerometry  measures was therefore effective at characterizing tremor in a population with  predominant postural and action tremor. The protocol is also illustrated on  repeated measures in an ET patient who underwent Magnetic Resonance-Guided  Focused Ultrasound thalamotomy. CONCLUSION: Quantitative assessment of tremor as  a continuous variable using wristwatch accelerometry is readily applicable as a  clinical tool when integrated with a standardized clinical exam and a  user-friendly software framework for analysis. The method is validated for  patients with predominant postural and action tremor, and can be adopted for  characterizing tremor of different etiologies with dissemination in a wide  variety of clinical and research contexts in ageing populations.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","878279","","","16","","Front Neuroinform","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Gauthier-Lafreniere, Aljassar, Rymar, Milton and Sadikot.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35991289  PMCID: PMC9386269","","","","Essential Tremor; Parkinson; accelerometry; clinical rating scale; focused ultrasound (MRgFUS); power spectrum; sensor; thalamotomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The response of tissue to HIFU  ablation differs based on the relative contributions of thermal and mechanical  effects, which can be varied to achieve optimal ablation parameters for a given  tissue type and location. In tumor ablation, similar to surgical resection, it is  desirable to include a safety margin of ablated tissue around the entirety of the  tumor. A factor in optimizing ablative techniques is minimizing the recurrence  rate, which can be due to incomplete ablation of the target tissue. Further,  combining focal ablation with immunotherapy is likely to be key for effective  treatment of metastatic cancer, and therefore characterizing the impact of  ablation on the tumor microenvironment will be important. Thus, visualization and  quantification of the extent of ablation is an integral component of ablative  procedures. The aim of this review article is to describe the radiological  findings after ultrasound ablation across multiple imaging modalities. This  review presents readers with a general overview of the current and emerging  imaging methods to assess the efficacy of ultrasound ablative treatments.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","9758652","","","2022","","BME Front","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35957844  PMCID: PMC9364780","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our earlier work showed that splenic  pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) alters inflammatory cytokines in models of acute  endotoxemia and pneumonia via modulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory  pathway (CAP) (ref below). Based on these earlier results, we hypothesized that  daily splenic exposure to pFUS during wound healing would accelerate closure rate  via altered systemic cytokine titers. In this study, we applied non-invasive  ultrasound directed to the spleen of a rodent model [Zucker Diabetic Sprague  Dawley (ZDSD) rats] of T2DM with full thickness cutaneous excisional wounds in an  attempt to accelerate wound healing via normalization of T2DM-driven aberrant  cytokine expression. Daily (1x/day, Monday-Friday) pFUS pulses were targeted  externally to the spleen area for 3 min over the course of 15 days. Wound  diameter was measured daily, and levels of cytokines were evaluated in spleen and  wound bed lysates. Non-invasive splenic pFUS accelerated wound closure by up to  4.5 days vs. sham controls. The time to heal in all treated groups was comparable  to that of healthy rats from previously published studies (ref below), suggesting  that the pFUS treatment restored a normal wound healing phenotype to the ZDSD  rats. IL-6 was lower in stimulated spleen (-2.24 ± 0.81 Log2FC, p = 0.02) while  L-selectin was higher in the wound bed of stimulated rodents (2.53 ± 0.72 Log2FC,  p = 0.003). In summary, splenic pFUS accelerates healing in a T2DM rat model,  demonstrating the potential of the method to provide a novel, non-invasive  approach for wound care in diabetes.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1039960","","","16","","Front Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Morton, Cotero, Ashe, Ginty and Puleo.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36478877  PMCID: PMC9721138","","","","bioelectronic medicine; excisional wounds; nerve stimulation; neuromodulation; therapy; ultrasound; wound care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most thrombolytic effects of traditional treatments or  nanomedicine are not efficient or safe enough. Therefore, we designed a  nanoparticle (NP) with a combination of a phase transition material and  thrombolytic drugs for efficient and safe thrombolysis. METHODS: A thrombus  fibrin-targeted and phase transition NP was designed and contained  perfluorohexane (PFH) and the thrombolytic drug rtPA core, with CREKA  polypeptides attached to the shell of the PLGA NPs. Characterization of the phase  transition and ultrasound imaging of the NPs was carried out under low-intensity  focused ultrasound (LIFU). LIFU-responsive drug release in vitro was also  explored. Under the synergistic effect of PFH and rtPA, the efficient  thrombolysis ability of the NPs was studied in vitro and in vivo. In vivo  monitoring of thrombosis and biosafety were also verified. RESULTS: The PPrC NPs  had good ultrasound imaging ability under LIFU irradiation and were related to  the phase transition characteristics of the NPs. CREKA polypeptides can  effectively increase the aggregation of the NPs on thrombi. Under static and  dynamic conditions in vitro, the ""liquid to gas"" transformation effect of PFH can  perform the destruction function of the excavator at the thrombus site and  promote the specific release of rtPA, and the subsequent rtPA drug thrombolysis  can further fully dissolve the thrombus. In vivo experiments showed that the NPs  can monitor the formation of thrombi and have good thrombolytic effects, with  significantly reduced bleeding side effects. The biochemical indexes of the rats  were within normal limits after treatment. CONCLUSION: PPrC NPs loaded with PFH  and rtPA combining a mechanical way of blasting with thrombolytic drugs may be a  promising new and reliable approach for thrombus monitoring and treatment.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","5229-5246","","","17","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Hu et al.","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 36388875  PMCID: PMC9662339","","","","*Nanoparticles/chemistry; *Thrombosis/drug therapy; Animals; Fibrinolysis; Fibrinolytic Agents/chemistry; PFH; Rats; Tissue Plasminogen Activator; low-intensity focused ultrasound; phase transition; rtPA; thrombolysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stereotactic neuromodulation is considered when the tremors are  intractable. Targeting the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) is common; however,  the outcome is often unsatisfactory, and the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) is  expected as alternative target. In this study, we report the case of a patient  with intractable Holmes tremor who underwent dual-lead deep brain stimulation  (DBS) to stimulate multiple locations in the PSA and thalamus. The patient was a  77-year-old female who complained of severe tremor in her left upper extremity  that developed one year after her right thalamic infarction. Vim-thalamotomy  using focused ultrasound therapy (FUS) was initially performed but failed to  control tremor. Subsequently, we performed DBS using two leads to stimulate four  different structures. Accordingly, one lead was implanted with the aim of  targeting the ventral oralis nucleus (Vo)/zona incerta (Zi), and the other with  the aim of targeting the Vim/prelemniscal radiation (Raprl). Electrode  stimulation revealed that Raprl and Zi had obvious effects. Postoperatively, the  patient achieved good tremor control without any side effects, which was  maintained for two years. Considering that she demonstrated resting, postural,  and intention/action tremor, and Vim-thalamotomy by FUS was insufficient for  tremor control, complicated pathogenesis was presumed in her symptoms including  both the cerebellothalamic and the pallidothalamic pathways. Using the dual-lead  DBS technique, we have more choices to adjust the stimulation at multiple sites,  where different functional networks are connected. Intractable tremors, such as  Holmes tremor, may have complicated pathology, therefore, modulating multiple  pathological networks is necessary. We suggest that the dual-lead DBS (Vo/Raprl  and Vim/Zi) presented here is safe, technically feasible, and possibly effective  for the control of Holmes tremor.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1065459","","","16","","Front Hum Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Maesawa, Torii, Nakatsubo, Noda, Mutoh, Ito, Ishizaki, Tsuboi, Suzuki, Tanei, Katsuno and Saito.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36590066  PMCID: PMC9798537","","","","Holmes tremor; deep brain stimulation; dual-lead; posterior subthalamic area; thalamus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultrasound beam focusing and steering (through beamforming)  was demonstrated where the array was driven with 14.6 V square unipolar pulses.  The PMUT generated a maximum peak-to-peak focused acoustic pressure output of  0.44 MPa at a focal distance of 20 mm with a 9.2 mm and 1 mm axial and lateral  resolution, respectively.

The current study sought to evaluate the  functional impact of MRgFUS thalamotomy in patients with ET, as well as to  investigate the relationship between neuronal activity changes and tremor  control. METHODS: This study included 30 patients with ET who underwent MRgFUS  thalamotomy with a 6-month follow-up involving MRI and clinical tremor rating.  Additional sex- and age-matched healthy people were recruited for the healthy  control group. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and  regional homogeneity were used to identify functional alteration regions of  interest (ROIs). To investigate changes after treatment, ROI- and seed-based  functional connectivity (FC) analyses were performed. RESULTS: Patients with ET  had significantly increased fALFF in the right postcentral gyrus (PoCG; ROI 1),  regional homogeneity in the left PoCG (ROI 2), and regional homogeneity in the  right PoCG (ROI 3, cluster-level p value family-wise error [pFWE] < 0.05), which  were recovered and normalized at 6 months after MRgFUS thalamotomy. FCs between  ROI 2 and the right supramarginal gyrus, ROI 2 and the right superior parietal  gyrus, and ROI 3 and the left precentral gyrus were also found to be increased  after treatment (cluster-level pFWE < 0.05). Furthermore, changes in fALFF,  regional homogeneity, and FC values were significantly correlated with tremor  relief (p < 0.05). Preoperative FC strengths were found to be inversely related  to the postoperative tremor control ratio (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients  with ET, the VIM lesion of MRgFUS thalamotomy resulted in symptom-related  regional functional recovery associated with sensorimotor and attention networks.  Preoperative FC strengths may reflect the postoperative tremor control ratio,  implying that this metric could be a useful neuroimaging biomarker for predicting  symptom relief in patients with ET following thalamotomy.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","E5","","6","53","","Neurosurg Focus","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36455269","","","","*Essential Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Psychosurgery; Humans; Thalamic Nuclei; Tremor; Ultrasonography; essential tremor; fALFF; fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation; functional connectivity; magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound; regional homogeneity; resting-state functional MRI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pulmonary delivery of nanoscale-based drug delivery systems offered a strategy to  increase antitumor activity with minimal adverse exposure. Herein, we report an  osimertinib-loaded perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (AZD9291-PFCE) nanoemulsion,  through intratracheal and intravenous delivery, synergizes with (19)F magnetic  resonance imaging ((19)F MRI)-guided low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) for  lung cancer therapy. Pulmonary delivery of AZD9291-PFCE nanoemulsion in  orthotopic lung carcinoma models achieves quick distribution of the nanoemulsion  in lung tissues and tumors without short-term and long-term toxic effects.  Furthermore, LIFU can trigger drug release from the AZD9291-PFCE nanoemulsion and  specifically increases tumor vascular and tumor tissue permeability. (19)F MRI  was applied to quantify nanoemulsion accumulation in tumors in real time after  LIFU irradiation. We validate the treatment effect of AZD9291-PFCE nanoemulsion  in resected human lung cancer tissues, proving the translational potential to  enhance clinical outcomes of lung cancer therapy.

ADV-generated bubbles can be  used as contrast agents in acoustic imaging, as drug carriers to deliver drugs to  particular targets, and also in embolotherapy, thermal therapy, and histotripsy.  However, despite much progress, ADV dynamics have still not been well understood  and properly modeled. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of  ultrasound-induced evaporation of a droplet encapsulated by a shell. The main  emphasis of this theoretical study is on a proper description of the  supercritical state occurring after bubble collapse. For this purpose, an  isentropic equation of state for a van der Waals gas is used to describe the  bubble behavior in the supercritical state. Sensitivity of the vaporization  process is investigated for different acoustic and geometrical parameters and  mechanical properties of the shell. Results show that the value of the minimum  pressure required for direct vaporization (without any oscillatory behavior)  depends on shell elasticity and initial size of the droplet, especially at high  frequencies (greater than 2[MHz]). Moreover, it has been shown that applying an  acoustic wave with proper phase such that thermal equilibrium of the bubble  temperature with the surrounding liquid is attained, results in direct  vaporization at lower acoustic pressure.","2022-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","105948","","","83","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

However, insufficient  signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly degrades the applicability of those  applications which require high SNR, e.g. magnetic resonance guided  high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) treatment.

To evaluate the SNR improvement and temperature  accuracy of WICS coil, the ex vivo experiments were performed on the pork  tenderloins (n = 7) and the hind legs of deceased Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 5). To  demonstrate the feasibility, the in vivo experiments were performed on the hind  leg of Sprague-Dawley rat (n = 1).

Since the focal point of  tFUS needs to be fixated precisely to the target brain region during stimulation,  a critical issue is to identify and maintain the accurate position and  orientation of the tFUS transducer relative to the subject's head. This study  aims to propose the entire framework of tFUS stimulation integrating the methods  previously proposed by the authors for tFUS transducer configuration optimization  and a subject-specific 3D-printed helmet, and to validate this complete setup in  a human behavioral neuromodulation study. METHODS: To find the optimal  configuration of the tFUS transducer, a numerical method based on  subject-specific tFUS beamlines simulation was used. Then, the subject-specific  3D-printed helmet has been applied to effectively secure the transducer at the  estimated optimal configuration. To validate this tFUS framework, a common  behavioral neuromodulation paradigm was chosen; the effect of the dorsolateral  prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) stimulation on anti-saccade (AS) behavior. While human  participants (n=2) were performing AS tasks, tFUS stimulations were randomly  applied to the left DLPFC right after the fixation target disappeared. RESULTS:  The neuromodulation result strongly suggests that the cortical stimulation using  the proposed tFUS setup is effective in significantly reducing the error rates of  anti-saccades (about -10 %p for S1 and -16 %p for S2), whereas no significant  effect was observed on their latencies. These observed behavioral effects are  consistent with the previous results based on conventional brain stimulation or  lesion studies. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed subject-specific tFUS framework has  been effectively used in human neuromodulation study. The result suggests that  the tFUS stimulation targeted to the DLPFC can generate a neuromodulatory effect  on AS behavior.","2022-11","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","107127","","","226","","Comput Methods Programs Biomed","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the  outcomes of artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) after HIFU. The aim of this study  was to evaluate the functional outcomes of AUS for post-HIFU urinary  incontinence. METHODS: The charts of all male patients who underwent an AUS  implantation between 2004 and 2020 in 13 centers were reviewed retrospectively.  Only men with a history of HIFU were included. The primary endpoint was social  continence at 3 months defined as wearing 0 to 1 pad per day. RESULTS: Out of  1318 procedures, nine men were implanted with an AUS after HIFU including four  men with an history of pelvic irradiation: 3 pelvic radiation therapy and 1  prostatic brachytherapy. The patients were divided into two groups, 5 in the HIFU  group without a history of pelvic irradiation, 4 patients in the HIRX group with  a history of pelvic irradiation. The median age was 74 years (IQR 71-76). There  was no perioperative complication. The median follow-up was 47.5 (IQR 25-85.5)  months. Social continence at 3 months was 75% in the total cohort: 80% in the  HIFU group and 67% in the HIRX group.

Pediatrics","","1933-0715 1933-0707","10.3171/2022.8.PEDS22144","","OBJECTIVE: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a neurovascular complication due to premature birth that results in blood clots forming within the ventricles.  Magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) has been  investigated as a noninvasive treatment to lyse clots. The authors designed and  constructed a robotic MRgHIFU platform to treat the neonatal brain that  facilitates ergonomic patient positioning. The clot lysis efficacy of the  platform is quantified using a brain phantom and clinical MRI system. METHODS: A  thermosensitive brain-mimicking phantom with ventricular cavities was developed  to test the clot lysis efficacy of the robotic MRgHIFU platform. Whole porcine  blood was clotted within the phantom's cavities. Using the MRgHIFU platform and a  boiling histotripsy treatment procedure (500 W, 10-msec pulse duration, 1.0% duty  cycle, and 40-second duration), the clots were lysed inside the phantom. The  contents of the cavities were vacuum filtered, and the remaining mass of the  solid clot particles was used to quantify the percentage of clot lysis. The  interior of the phantom's cavities was inspected for any collateral damage during  treatment. RESULTS: A total of 9 phantoms were sonicated, yielding an average (±  SD) clot lysis of 97.0% ± 2.57%. Treatment resulted in substantial clot lysis  within the brain-mimicking phantoms that were apparent on postsonication  T2-weighted MR images. No apparent collateral damage was observed within the  phantom after treatment. The results from the study showed the MRgHIFU platform  was successful at lysing more than 90% of a blood clot at a statistically  significant level. CONCLUSIONS: The robotic MRgHIFU platform was shown to lyse a  large percentage of a blood clot with no observable collateral damage. These  results demonstrate the platform's ability to induce clot lysis when targeting  through simulated brain matter and show promise toward the final application in  neonatal patients.","2022-12-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","586-594","","6","30","","J Neurosurg Pediatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36115058","","","","*Robotic Surgical Procedures; *Thrombosis; Animals; Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Cerebral Ventricles; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Swine; Ultrasonography; hydrocephalus; intraventricular hemorrhage; magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound; neurosurgical robotics; thermosensitive brain-mimicking phantoms; vascular disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were  included. The immediate HIFU ablation rate significantly differed between low-,  iso-, and high-enhancement UFs (87.2% ± 1.6%, 83.3% ± 2.1%, and 72.9% ± 3.1%,  respectively; p < 0.05).

Our recent study demonstrates that an ultrasonically actuated medical  needle can create cavitation phenomena inside water. However, the presence and  behavior of cavitation and related bioeffects in diagnostic and therapeutic  applications with ultrasonically actuated needles are not known.

However, there  are limitations with nonuniformity of cancer tissue destruction, heat sink effect  and the risk of thermal ablative injury. The current non-thermal ablative  techniques have high risk of local recurrence and are not widely adopted.  Histotripsy is a treatment technology that destroys targeted tissue under  ultrasound visualization via mechanical destruction through the precise  application of acoustic cavitation and can offer the potential of non-invasive,  non-thermal and non-ionizing radiation cancer treatment. The aim of this  multi-centre non-randomized phase I/II trial is to assess the initial safety and  efficacy of the prototype investigational 'System' in the treatment of primary  and metastatic liver cancers. METHODS/DESIGN: All non-surgical patients with  primary/metastatic liver cancers having had previous liver directed therapy,  radiation therapy or image-guided ablation may be offered image-guided  Histotripsy as per trial protocol. The co-primary endpoints are technical success  and procedural safety. Technical success is determined, at ≤ 36 h post procedure,  by evaluating the histotripsy treatment size and coverage. The procedural safety  is defined by procedure related major complications, defined as Common  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5) grade 3 or higher  toxicities, up to 30 days post procedure. This phase I/II trial has intended to  recruit up to 45 patients to show safety and efficacy of image-guided histotripsy  in liver cancers.

However, little is known on its actual  establishment in health care reality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We defined FT as  high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), hyperthermia ablation, cryotherapy,  transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA) or vascular-targeted photodynamic  therapy (VTP) TOOKAD(®). We analyzed the nationwide German hospital billing  database for a PCa diagnosis in combination with FT. For analyses on the hospital  level, we used the reimbursement.INFO tool based on hospitals' quality reports.  The study period was 2006 to 2019. RESULTS: We identified 23,677 cases of FT from  2006 to 2019. Considering all PCa cases with surgery, radiotherapy or FT, the  share of FT was stable at 4%. The annual caseload of FT increased to a maximum of  2653 cases in 2008 (p < 0.001) and then decreased to 1182 cases in 2014  (p < 0.001). Since 2015, the cases of FT remained on a plateau around 1400 cases  per year. The share of HIFU was stable at 92-96% from 2006 to 2017 and decreased  thereafter to 75% in 2019 (p = 0.015). In 2019, VTP-TOOKAD(®) increased to 11.5%  and TULSA to 6%. In 2006, 21% (62/299) of urological departments performed FT and  20 departments reached > 20 FT procedures. In 2019, 16% (58/368) of urological  departments performed FT and 7 departments reached > 20 FT. In 2019, 25  urological departments offered FT other than HIFU: 5 centers hyperthermia  ablation, 11 centers VTP TOOKAD(®), 3 centers cryotherapy, 6 centers TULSA.

We implemented a novel design of a HIFU phased-array transducer, dedicated  to transcostal hepatic thermo-ablation. Due to its large acoustic window and  strong focusing, the transducer should perform safely for this application.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: The new HIFU transducer is composed of 256 elements  distributed on 5 concentric segments of a specific radius (either 100, 111, or  125 mm). It has been optimally shaped to fit the abdominal wall. The shape and  size of the acoustic elements were optimized for the largest emitting surface and  the lowest symmetry. Calibration tests have been conducted on tissue-mimicking  gels under 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) guidance. In-vivo MR-guided HIFU treatment  was conducted in two pigs, aiming to create thermal ablation deep in the liver  without significant side effects. Imaging follow-up was performed at D0 and D7.  Sacrifice and post-mortem macroscopic examination occurred at D7, with the  ablated tissue being fixed for pathology. RESULTS: The device showed -3-dB  focusing capacities in a volume of 27 × 46 × 50 mm(3) as compared with the  numerical simulation volume of 18 × 48 × 60 mm(3). The shape of the focal area  was in millimeter-range agreement with the numerical simulations. No interference  was detected between the HIFU sonication and the MR acquisition. In vivo, the  temperature elevation in perivascular liver parenchyma reached 28°C above  physiological temperature, within one breath-hold. The lesion was visible on Gd  contrast-enhanced MRI sequences and post-mortem examination. The non-perfused  volume was found in pig #1 and pig #2 of 8/11, 6/8, and 7/7 mm along the LR, AP,  and HF directions, respectively. No rib burns or other near-field side effects  were visually observed on post-mortem gross examination. High-resolution  contrast-enhanced 3D MRI indicated a minor lesion on the sternum. CONCLUSION: The  performance of this new HIFU transducer has been demonstrated in vitro and in  vivo. The transducer meets the requirement to perform thermal lesions in deep  tissues, without the need for rib-sparing means.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","899440","","","12","","Front Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Lorton, Guillemin, M’Rad, Peloso, Boudabbous, Charbonnier, Holman, Crowe, Gui, Poletti, Ricoeur, Terraz and Salomir.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35769711  PMCID: PMC9235567","","","","HIFU; MR thermometry; hepatic ablation; phased-array; thermotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, its penetration depth in the tissue is insufficient for  achieving accurate intraoperative navigation, leading to residual tumor tissue.  Nanomedicine provides a new opportunity for PA imaging to guide HIFU surgery.  Studies have found that the hypoxic heterogeneity of tumor is effectively  reversed by HIFU. Herein, a specific metal-organic framework nanosystem,  constructed by coordination of banoxantrone (AQ4N) and Mn(2+) , is designed based  on HIFU to reverse the hypoxic heterogeneity of tumors. It can provide exogenous  light-absorbing substances, thus improving the penetrability of PA imaging signal  through the deep tissue and achieving clearer PA imaging for guiding HIFU  surgery. In turn, AQ4N, in the hypoxic homogenous environment of the tumor  provided by HIFU, is activated sequentially to specifically treat the residual  hypoxic tumor cells. This combination treatment manifests higher tumor  suppressors activation and lower expression of genes related to tumor  progression. This strategy addresses the dissatisfaction with PA imaging-guided  HIFU therapy and is promising for translation into a clinical combination  regimen.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","e2202348","","2","12","","Adv Healthc Mater","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 36281898","","","","*Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Metal-Organic Frameworks; *Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/therapy; *Photoacoustic Techniques/methods; HIFU; Humans; hypoxia-activated; nanomedicines; photoacoustic imaging; tumor theranostics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A cartridge strip containing  reagents for FFPE sample deparaffinization and NA extraction and purification is  operated by an automation tool consisting of a HIFU module, a liquid handling  robot unit, and accessories including a thermal block and magnets. The HIFU  module is a single concaved piezoelectric ceramic plate driven by a current-mode  class-D power amplifier.

However, better  methods to evaluate response to HIFU ablation are an unmet need.  Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and gastrin-releasing peptide receptors  are both overexpressed in PC. In this study, we evaluated a novel approach of  using both (68)Ga-RM2 and (68)Ga-PSMA11 PET/MRI in each patient before and after  HIFU to assess the accuracy of target tumor localization and response to  treatment. Methods: Fourteen men, 64.5 ± 8.0 y old (range, 48-78 y), with newly  diagnosed PC were prospectively enrolled. Before HIFU, the patients underwent  prostate biopsy, multiparametric MRI, (68)Ga-PSMA11, and (68)Ga-RM2 PET/MRI.  Response to treatment was assessed at a minimum of 6 mo after HIFU with prostate  biopsy (n = 13), as well as (68)Ga-PSMA11 and (68)Ga-RM2 PET/MRI (n = 14). The  SUV(max) and SUV(peak) of known or suspected PC lesions were collected. Results:  Pre-HIFU biopsy revealed 18 cancers, of which 14 were clinically significant  (Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4). Multiparametric MRI identified 18 lesions; 14 of them  were at least score 4 in the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System.  (68)Ga-PSMA11 and (68)Ga-RM2 PET/MRI each showed 23 positive intraprostatic  lesions; 21 were congruent in 13 patients, and 5 were incongruent in 5 patients.  Before HIFU, (68)Ga-PSMA11 identified all target tumors, whereas (68)Ga-RM2  PET/MRI missed 2 tumors. After HIFU, (68)Ga-RM2 and (68)Ga-PSMA11 PET/MRI both  identified clinically significant residual disease in 1 patient. Three  significant ipsilateral recurrent lesions were identified, whereas 1 was missed  by (68)Ga-PSMA11. The pretreatment level of prostate-specific antigen decreased  significantly after HIFU, by 66%. Concordantly, the pretreatment SUV(max)  decreased significantly after HIFU for (68)Ga-PSMA11 (P = 0.001) and (68)Ga-RM2  (P = 0.005). Conclusion: This pilot study showed that (68)Ga-PSMA11 and  (68)Ga-RM2 PET/MRI identified the target tumor for HIFU in 100% and 86% of cases,  respectively, and accurately verified response to treatment. PET may be a useful  tool in the guidance and monitoring of treatment success in patients receiving  focal therapy for PC. These preliminary findings warrant larger studies for  validation.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","592-597","","4","64","","J Nucl Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36328488","","","","*Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy; *Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/therapy/pathology; 68Ga-PSMA11; 68Ga-RM2; Gallium Radioisotopes; HIFU; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; PET; Pilot Projects; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography/methods; Positron-Emission Tomography; prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Non-compressible torso  hemorrhage (NCTH) has high mortality rate and there are currently no broadly  available therapies for NCTH outside of a surgical room environment. Novel  therapies, which include High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) have emerged as  promising methods for hemorrhage control as they can non-invasively cauterize  bleeding tissue deep within the body without injuring uninvolved regions. A major  challenge in the application of HIFU with color Doppler US guidance is the  interpretation and optimization of the blood flow images in real-time to identify  the hemorrhagic focus. Today, this task requires an expert sonographer, limiting  the utility of this therapy in non-clinical environments. In this work, we  investigated the feasibility of an automated hemorrhage detection method using a  Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for anomaly detection that learns a manifold  of normal blood flow variability and subsequently identifies anomalous flow  patterns that fall outside the learned manifold. As an initial feasibility study,  we collected ultrasound color Doppler images of femoral arteries in an animal  model of vascular injury (N = 11 pigs). Velocity information of the blood flow  were extracted from the color Doppler images that were used for training and  testing the anomaly detection network. Normotensive images from 8 pigs were used  for training, and testing was performed on normotensive, immediately after  injury, 10 minutes post-injury and 30 minutes post-injury images from 3 other  pigs. The residual images or the reconstructed error maps show promise in  detecting hemorrhages with an AUC of 0.90, 0.87, 0.62 immediately, 10 minutes  post-injury and 30 minutes post-injury respectively with an overall AUC of 0.83.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1800609","","","10","","IEEE J Transl Eng Health Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36051823  PMCID: PMC9423818","","","","*Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging; *Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color; Animals; Exsanguination; Femoral Artery/diagnostic imaging; Hemorrhage detection; Swine; Ultrasonography; color Doppler ultrasound; deep learning; generative adversarial network; unsupervised anomaly detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This was a dual-arm study in which each animal (n  = 14) received either a single hepatic microwave (n = 6) or histotripsy (n = 6  single treatment; n = 2 double treatment) under ultrasound guidance. The goal was  to create 2.5-3.0 cm short-axis treatments in similar locations across  modalities. Animals were survived for 1 month with contrast-enhanced CT imaging  on days 0, 2, 7, 14, and 28. On day 28, necropsy and histopathology were  performed. RESULTS: All procedures were well-tolerated. MW ablation zones were  longer and more oblong, but equivalent in the short axes to histotripsy zones on  immediate post-procedure CT (p < 0.001 and p = 0.45, respectively). Overall, MW  volumes were larger (21.4 cm(3) vs. 13.4 cm(3); p = 0.001) and histotripsy  treatment zones were more spherical (p = 0.007). Histotripsy zones were close to  the prescribed size (p < 0.001). Over the study period, histotripsy treatment  zones decreased in volume while microwave ablation zones slightly increased (-83%  vs. +17%, p = 0.001). There were several imaging-only findings: Branch portal  vein thrombus with both histotripsy (7/8) and MW (6/6), hematoma in 2/6 MW only,  and a gallbladder injury in 1/6 MW animals. The ablation zones demonstrated  complete cellular destruction for both modalities. CONCLUSION: Histotripsy was  associated with more spherical treatments, fewer biliary complications, and  greater treatment zone involution. Hepatic MW and histotripsy treatment in a  normal porcine model appear at least equally effective for creating treatment  zones with a similar safety profile. KEY POINTS: • Microwave ablation and  histotripsy for liver treatment in a healthy porcine model yield equivalent  procedural tolerance and cellular destruction. • Histotripsy was associated with  more spherical treatments, fewer biliary complications, and greater treatment  zone involution over the 28-day follow-up period. • These findings confirm the  safety and efficacy of hepatic histotripsy and support the pursuit of clinical  trials to further evaluate the translatability of these results.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1050-1062","","2","33","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Among  the patients, 287 cases were treated with HIFU (observation group), and 300 cases  were treated with LM (control group). The progression-free survival (PFS) was  taken as the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints included operation results  (including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and intraoperative fluid  replacement), complications, hemoglobin level one month after surgery and  clinical efficacy. In addition, the fibroid volume of the observation group  before treatment and 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment were also analyzed.  RESULTS: The operative time of observation group was evidently shortened compared  to the control group, and the intraoperative blood loss and intraoperative fluid  replacement of observation group were also considerably reduced (all p < 0.05),  but there was no significant difference in the hemoglobin level between the two  groups one month after surgery (p > 0.05).

The mean PFS of patients in the  observation group and control group was 29.71 months (95% CI 28.24-29.75) and  26.74 months (95% CI 26.49-28.33), respectively (HR 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.76;  Log-rank p = 0.0019). CONCLUSIONS: HIFU could improve the intraoperative efficacy  and reduce the complications of patients with uterine fibroids and has excellent  performance in improving clinical efficacy and prolonging PFS. HIFU can be used  as an alternative to surgical treatment.","2023","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","358-365","","5","94","","Ginekol Pol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Poland PMID: 35894494","","","","*Leiomyoma/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Uterine Myomectomy/adverse effects/methods; *Uterine Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/surgery/etiology; Blood Loss, Surgical; Female; Hemoglobins; Humans; Treatment Outcome; clinical efficacy; high intensity focused ultrasound; laparoscopic myomectomy; safety; uterine fibroids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that low-intensity FUS of  the vagus nerve would regulate autonomic function and thus BP.Approach.17  anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with low-intensity FUS  of the left vagus nerve for 15 min each trial. Continuous BP, heart rate,  respiration rate (RR), and core body temperature were simultaneously recorded to  evaluate the effects on BP and other physiological parameters. Heart rate  variability (HRV), systolic BP variability, and baroreflex sensitivity were  computed to evaluate the autonomic modulation function. A Control-sham group  without stimulation and another Control-FUS group with non-target stimulation  were also examined to exclude the influence of potential confounding factors on  autonomic modulation.Main results.A prolonged significant decrease in BP, pulse  pressure, RR, the normalized low-frequency power of HRV, and the low-to-high  frequency power ratio of HRV were found after the low-intensity FUS of the left  vagus nerve in comparison with the baseline and those of the control groups,  demonstrating that activities of the sympathetic nervous system were inhibited.  The prolonged significant increase of the normalized high-frequency power of HRV  suggested the activation of parasympathetic activity.Significance.Low-intensity  FUS of the left vagus nerve effectively improved the autonomic function by  activating parasympathetic efferent and inhibiting sympathetic efferent, which  contributes to BP reduction. The findings shed light on the hypotensive mechanism  underlying FUS.","2022-12-16","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","6","19","","J Neural Eng","","","","","","","","eng","Creative Commons Attribution license.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36541473","","","","*Autonomic Nervous System; *Vagus Nerve Stimulation/methods; Blood Pressure/physiology; Heart Rate/physiology; Sympathetic Nervous System; Vagus Nerve/physiology; autonomic modulation; blood pressure modulation; heart rate variability; hypertension; low-intensity focused ultrasound stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This systematic  review analyzed available evidence regarding minimally invasive approaches to  fibroid treatment and compared validated QoL and fibroid-associated symptom  scores before and after treatment. A comprehensive search was conducted using  PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus from January 1990 to July 2020.  English-language publications were included if they evaluated associations  between minimally invasive approaches to fibroid treatment and QoL or  fibroid-associated symptoms, and they used validated questionnaires before and  after treatment. QoL or fibroid-associated symptom scores were compared and  summarized for each minimally invasive approach. Thirty-seven studies were  ultimately included in this review: 26 evaluating individual approaches and 11  which were comparative studies of minimally invasive approaches and surgical  interventions. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy  (USGS) significantly improved overall QoL. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) and  ultrasound-guided high-intensity frequency ultrasound (US-HIFU) improved overall  QoL to a similar extent as surgical interventions. Twenty-eight studies assessed  fibroid-associated symptoms with the Uterine Fibroid Symptoms Quality of Life  Questionnaire (UFS-QoL). UAE, magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity  frequency ultrasound (MR-HIFU), US-HIFU, RFA, and percutaneous microwave ablation  (PMWA) significantly decreased Symptom Severity Score by a range of 21 to 39  points (out of 100) at 6 months. Minimally invasive approaches to treat fibroids  were effective alternatives to surgical interventions for improving quality of  life, fibroid-associated symptoms, and pain.

METHODS: In  this retrospective study, data pertaining to women treated for cervical SIL with  FUS therapy or cryotherapy at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical  University between 21 April 2018 and 31 August 2020 were obtained. The patients  were followed up after 3-6 and 6-12 months. The proportions of women with no  evidence of disease, recurrent disease, clearance of the human papillomavirus  (HPV) and adverse effects or complications were determined. RESULTS: Of the 250  women with complete data who were included in the study, 144 and 106 received FUS  therapy and cryotherapy, respectively. Overall, FUS therapy was observed to be  more effective than cryotherapy (91.7 vs. 79.2%, p = 0.005). Statistically  significant differences were noted in the treatment efficacy for patients with  low-grade SIL (LSIL) (92.3 vs. 80.2%, p = 0.011). However, there were no  significant differences in the treatment efficacy for patients with high-grade  SIL (HSIL) (88.9 vs. 75.0%, p = 0.390). The recurrence rates in patients with  LSIL treated with FUS therapy or cryotherapy showed no significant differences at  the 6-12-month follow-up (1.0 vs. 6.0%, p = 0.163). Furthermore, there was no  recurrence in patients with HSIL, either in the FUS or cryotherapy group. FUS  therapy and cryotherapy resulted in similar HPV clearance at the 3-6-month  follow-up (77.1 vs. 64.8%, p = 0.057).

Currently, therapeutic agents targeting amyloid appear promising for AD, however,  delivery to the CNS is limited due to the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Focused  ultrasound (FUS) is a method to induce a temporary opening of the BBB to enhance  the delivery of therapeutic agents to the CNS. In this study, we evaluated the  acute effects of FUS and whether the use of FUS-induced BBB opening enhances the  delivery of 07/2a mAb, an anti-pyroglutamate-3 Aβ antibody, in aged 24 mo-old  APP/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. FUS was performed either unilaterally or bilaterally  with mAb infusion and the short-term effect was analyzed 4 h and 72 h  post-treatment. Quantitative analysis by ELISA showed a 5-6-fold increase in  07/2a mAb levels in the brain at both time points and an increased brain-to-blood  ratio of the antibody. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated an increase in IgG2a mAb  detection particularly in the cortex, enhanced immunoreactivity of resident Iba1+  and phagocytic CD68+ microglial cells, and a transient increase in the  infiltration of Ly6G+ immune cells. Cerebral microbleeds were not altered in the  unilaterally or bilaterally sonicated hemispheres. Overall, this study shows the  potential of FUS therapy for the enhanced delivery of CNS therapeutics.","2022-07-06","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","7","12","","Biomolecules","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35883506  PMCID: PMC9313174","","","","*Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy; *Blood-Brain Barrier; Animals; Brain/physiology; Immunity; Immunoglobulin G/therapeutic use; Mice; Plaque, Amyloid; focused ultrasound; microglia; pyroglutamate-3 Aβ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total of  153 patients with CSP were enrolled and classified according to the type of CSP.  All of them were treated by HIFU combined with ultrasound-guided suction  curettage. When active uterine bleeding was observed after curettage, a Foley  balloon was used for hemostasis by compression. Baseline characteristics,  technical parameters of HIFU, intraoperative blood loss in suction curettage, the  time for serum β-HCG to return to normal levels, reproductive outcomes, and  adverse effects were recorded and analyzed.

Ultrasound imaging has the capability to guide  clinicians toward a lesion in real time, but is not an ideal option, as HIFU  application causes strong interference, thereby substantially distorting the  images used for guidance. Thus, this study introduces singular value  decomposition-based filtering capable of restoring ultrasound harmonic images  from HIFU interference without undesirable spectral distortion.

While histotripsy alone degrades  the cellular content of tissue, recent studies have demonstrated it effectively  disrupts the extracellular structure of pathologic conditions such as venous  thrombosis when combined with a thrombolytic drug. Rather than relying on  standard administration methods, associating thrombolytic drugs with an  ultrasound-triggered echogenic liposome vesicle will enable targeted, systemic  drug delivery. To date, histotripsy has primarily relied on nano-nuclei inherent  to the medium for bubble cloud generation, and microbubbles associated with  echogenic liposomes may alter the histotripsy bubble dynamics. The objective of  this work was to investigate the interaction of histotripsy pulse with echogenic  liposomes.Approach.Bubble clouds were generated using a focused source in anin  vitromodel of venous flow. Acoustic emissions generated during the insonation  were passively acquired to assess the mechanical activity of the bubble cloud.  High frame rate, pulse inversion imaging was used to track the change in  echogenicity of the liposomes following histotripsy exposure.Main results.For  peak negative pressures less than 20 MPa, acoustic emissions indicative of stable  and inertial bubble activity were observed. As the peak negative pressure of the  histotripsy excitation increased, harmonics of the excitation were observed in  OFP t-ELIP solutions and plasma alone. Additional observations with high frame  rate imaging indicated a transition of bubble behavior as the pulse pressure  transitioned to shock wave formation.Significance.These observations suggest that  a complex interaction between histotripsy pulses and echogenic liposomes that may  be exploited for combination treatment approaches.","2022-10-31","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","21","67","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Creative Commons Attribution license.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36220055  PMCID: PMC10712043","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Liposomes; Fibrinolytic Agents; Microbubbles; Ultrasonography/methods; bubble dynamics; echogenic liposomes; exogenous nuclei; focused ultrasound; histotripsy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this, we  developed a fiber Photometry Coupled focused Ultrasound System (PhoCUS) for  simultaneously monitoring FUS effects on neural activity of subcortical  genetically targeted cell types in freely behaving animals. We identified a  parameter set that selectively increases activity of parvalbumin interneurons  while suppressing excitatory neurons in the hippocampus.

A variety of  biomaterials and therapeutic delivery devices have recently been developed that  facilitate drug delivery to the brain. These technologies have addressed many of  the limitations imposed by the BBB by: (1) designing or modifying the  physiochemical properties of therapeutic compounds to allow for transport across  the BBB; (2) bypassing the BBB by administration of drugs via alternative routes;  and (3) transiently disrupting the BBB (BBBD) using biophysical therapies. Here  we specifically review colloidal drug carrier delivery systems, intranasal,  intrathecal, and direct interstitial drug delivery methods, focused ultrasound  BBBD, and pulsed electrical field induced BBBD, as well as the key features of  BBB structure and function that are the mechanistic targets of these approaches.  Each of these drug delivery technologies are illustrated in the context of their  potential clinical applications and limitations in companion animals with  naturally occurring intracranial diseases.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1039745","","","9","","Front Vet Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Partridge, Eardley, Morales, Campelo, Lorenzo, Mehta, Kani, Mora, Campbell, Arena, Platt, Mintz, Shinn, Rylander, Debinski, Davalos and  Rossmeisl.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36330152  PMCID: PMC9623817","","","","blood-brain barrier; brain tumors; convection enhanced delivery; focused ultrasound; interstitial delivery; nanoparticles; pulsed electric fields","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is approved for the treatment of  essential tremors, ablation of prostate, hepatic, breast, and uterine tumors.  Although not approved for use in the treatment of atherosclerotic arterial  disease, there is a growing body of evidence investigating applications of HIFU.  Currently, percutaneous endovascular techniques are predominant for the treatment  of arterial pathology; however, there are no endovascular techniques of HIFU  available. This study aims to review the state of current evidence for the  application of HIFU in atherosclerotic arterial disease. METHODS: All  English-language articles evaluating the effect of HIFU on arterial occlusive and  thrombotic disease until 2021 were reviewed. Both preclinical and human clinical  studies were included. Study parameters such as animal or clinical model and  outcomes were reviewed. In addition, details pertaining to settings on the HIFU  device used were also reviewed. RESULTS: In preclinical models, atherosclerotic  plaque progression was inhibited by HIFU, through decreases in oxidized  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increases in macrophage apoptosis.  Additionally, HIFU promotes angiogenesis in hindlimb ischemic models by the  upregulation of angiogenic and antiapoptotic factors, with increased angiogenesis  at higher line densities of HIFU. HIFU also promotes thrombolysis and conversely  induces platelet activation at low frequencies and higher intensities. Various  clinical studies have attempted to translate some of these properties and  demonstrated positive clinical outcomes for arterial recanalization after  thrombotic stroke, decreased atherosclerotic plaque burden in carotid arteries,  increase in tissue perfusion and a decrease in diameter stenosis in patients with  atherosclerotic arterial disease. CONCLUSIONS: In current preclinical and  clinical data, the safety and efficacy of HIFU shows great promise in the  treatment of atherosclerotic arterial disease. Future focused studies are  warranted to guide the refinement of HIFU settings for more widespread adoption  of this technology.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","292-305","","","3","","JVS Vasc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 by the Society for Vascular Surgery.

The correlation between  anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) expression and adenomyosis is unclear. Few studies  investigated this possible correlation with promising results. The aim of this  mini-review is to illustrate the potential prognostic and therapeutic role of AMH  in adenomyosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A study protocol was completed conforming  to the Preferred Reporting Items for Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)  guidelines for systematic reviews. We performed an electronic databases search  from each database's inception from August 2017 to August 2022 for full-text  articles and published abstracts. For database searches, the following main  keywords were the following text words: ""adenomyosis"" or ""uterine endometriosis""  [Mesh] AND ""AMH"" or ""anti-mullerian hormone"". RESULTS: From the literature  search, 8 abstracts of studies were retrieved and independently screened for  inclusion by three authors. It was found that the most common therapeutic  strategies (such as adenomyomectomy and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)  do not alter AMH levels. Moreover, a higher expression of the AMH receptor II was  observed in adenomyotic tissue, hence a possible therapeutic use of AMH was  hypothesized. CONCLUSION: The available evidence shows an unclear relationship  between adenomyosis and AMH. Probably, women with adenomyosis have lower levels  of AMH and the surgical treatment (adenomyomectomy, HIFU) does not alter this  characteristic, therefore in all of them, ovarian function is not influenced.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1014519","","","13","","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Gulino, Dilisi, Capriglione, Cannone, Catania, Martire, Tuscano, Gulisano, D’Urso, Di Stefano, Cimino, Filippini, Latella, Sammarini, Musmeci and  Palumbo.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36120472  PMCID: PMC9471373","","","","*Adenomyosis/therapy; *Endometriosis/therapy; *Peptide Hormones; Anti-Mullerian Hormone; Female; Humans; Prognosis; adenomyomectomy; adenomyosis; amh; fertility; hifu (high intensity focus ultrasound)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because compelling studies have shown that focused ultrasound can  modulate neuronal activity non-invasively, especially in deep brain structures  with high spatial specificity, there has been a renewed interest in attempting to  understand the specific bioeffects of focused ultrasound at the cellular level.  Such information is needed to facilitate the safe and effective use of focused  ultrasound to treat a number of brain and nervous system disorders in humans.  Unfortunately, to date, there appears to be no singular biological mechanism to  account for the actions of focused ultrasound, and it is becoming increasingly  clear that different types of nerve cells will respond to focused ultrasound  differentially based on the complement of their ion channels, other membrane  biophysical properties, and arrangement of synaptic connections. Furthermore,  neurons are apparently not equally susceptible to the mechanical, thermal and  cavitation-related consequences of focused ultrasound application-to complicate  matters further, many studies often use distinctly different focused ultrasound  stimulus parameters to achieve a reliable response in neural activity. In this  review, we consider the benefits of studying more experimentally tractable  invertebrate preparations, with an emphasis on the medicinal leech, where neurons  can be studied as unique individual cells and be synaptically isolated from the  indirect effects of focused ultrasound stimulation on mechanosensitive afferents.  In the leech, we have concluded that heat is the primary effector of focused  ultrasound neuromodulation, especially on motoneurons in which we observed a  focused ultrasound-mediated blockade of action potentials. We discuss that the  mechanical bioeffects of focused ultrasound, which are frequently described in  the literature, are less reliably achieved as compared to thermal ones, and that  observations ascribed to mechanical responses may be confounded by activation of  synaptically-coupled sensory structures or artifacts associated with electrode  resonance. Ultimately, both the mechanical and thermal components of focused  ultrasound have significant potential to contribute to the sculpting of specific  neural outcomes. Because focused ultrasound can generate significant modulation  at a temperature <5°C, which is believed to be safe for moderate durations, we  support the idea that focused ultrasound should be considered as a thermal  neuromodulation technology for clinical use, especially targeting neural pathways  in the peripheral nervous system.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1047324","","","13","","Front Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Collins and Mesce.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36439246  PMCID: PMC9685663","","","","leech; low-intensity focused ultrasound; mechanotransduction; model organisms; neuromodulation; non-invasive brain stimulation; thermal modulation; transcranial focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatment for GBM primarily consists of maximal safe surgical  resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy using temozolomide. Nonetheless,  recurrence and tumor progression is the norm, driven by tumor stem cell activity  and a high mutational burden. Focused ultrasound (FUS) has shown promising  results in preclinical and clinical trials for treatment of GBM and has received  regulatory approval for the treatment of other neoplasms. Here, we review the  range of applications for FUS in the treatment of GBM, which depend on  parameters, including frequency, power, pulse duration, and duty cycle.  Low-intensity FUS can be used to transiently open the blood-brain barrier (BBB),  which restricts diffusion of most macromolecules and therapeutic agents into the  brain. Under guidance from magnetic resonance imaging, the BBB can be targeted in  a precise location to permit diffusion of molecules only at the vicinity of the  tumor, preventing side effects to healthy tissue. BBB opening can also be used to  improve detection of cell-free tumor DNA with liquid biopsies, allowing  non-invasive diagnosis and identification of molecular mutations. High-intensity  FUS can cause tumor ablation via a hyperthermic effect. Additionally, FUS can  stimulate immunological attack of tumor cells, can activate sonosensitizers to  exert cytotoxic effects on tumor tissue, and can sensitize tumors to radiation  therapy. Finally, another mechanism under investigation, known as histotripsy,  produces tumor ablation via acoustic cavitation rather than thermal effects.","2022-10-08","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","19","14","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36230843  PMCID: PMC9563027","","","","FUS; blood–brain barrier; focused ultrasound; glioblastoma; targeted therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A previous systematic review indicated that  there is growing evidence for favorable functional outcomes, but that oncological  effectiveness was yet to be defined. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of  focal therapy in patients with localized prostate cancer in terms of functional  and oncological outcomes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane  Library were searched for studies between October 2015 and December 31, 2020. In  addition, the research stages were acquired according to the Idea, Development,  Exploration, Assessment, Long-term study (IDEAL) recommendations. Ongoing studies  were identified through clinical trial registries. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS:  Seventy-two studies were identified exploring eight different sources of energy  to deliver focal therapy in 5827 patients. Twenty-seven studies reported on  high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), nine studies on irreversible  electroporation, 11 on cryoablation, eight on focal laser ablation and focal  brachytherapy, seven on photodynamic therapy (PDT), two on radiofrequency  ablation, and one on prostatic artery embolization. The majority of studies were  prospective development stage 2a studies (n = 357). PDT and HIFU, both in stage  3, showed promising results. Overall, HIFU studies reported a median of 95%  pad-free patients and a median of 85% patients with no clinically significant  cancer (CSC) in the treated area. For PDT, no changes in continence were reported  and a median of 90% of patients were without CSC. Both treatments were well  tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 5 yr, focal therapy has been studied for  eight different energy sources, mostly in single-arm stage 2 studies. Although a  first randomized controlled trial in focal therapy has been performed, more  high-quality evaluations are needed, preferably via multicenter randomized  controlled trials with long-term follow-up and predefined assessment of  oncological and functional outcomes and health-related quality-of-life measures.  PATIENT SUMMARY: Focal treatment (FT) of prostate cancer has potential,  considering that it has less impact on continence and potency than radical  treatment. Our systematic review indicates that despite the method being studied  extensively over the past half decade, the majority of studies remain in an early  research stage. The techniques high-intensity focused ultrasound and photodynamic  therapy have shown most progression toward advanced research stages and show  favorable results. However, more high-quality evidence is required before FT can  become available as a standard treatment.","2022-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","5-33","","1","81","","Eur Urol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 The Authors.
