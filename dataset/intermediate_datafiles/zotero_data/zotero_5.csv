Unlike high-intensity focused ultrasound directly killing tumor,  low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), a new noninvasive physical device,  promotes pluripotent stem cell differentiation and is primarily applied in tissue  engineering but rarely in oncotherapy. We explored the effect and mechanism of  LIPUS on glioma stem cell (GSC) expulsion from quiescence. Here, we observed that  LIPUS led to attenuated expression of GSC biomarkers, promoted GSC escape from G0  quiescence, and significantly weakened the Wnt and Hh pathways. Of note, LIPUS  transferred sonomechanical energy into cytochrome c and B5 proteins, which  converted oxygen molecules into singlet oxygen, triggering telomere crisis. The  in vivo and in vitro results confirmed that LIPUS enhanced the GSC sensitivity to  temozolomide. These results demonstrated that LIPUS ""waked up"" GSCs to improve  their sensitivity to chemotherapy, and importantly, we confirmed the direct  targeted proteins of LIPUS in GSCs.","2022-01-21","2024-03-06 17:12:21","2024-03-06T17:12:21Z","","103558","","1","25","","iScience","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.","","","","","","PMID: 34988401  PMCID: PMC8693467","","","","Cancer; Cell biology; Medical device; Stem cells research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, many thrombus-targeted nanoparticles (NPs) have been constructed for detecting  thrombi or monitoring thrombolysis, but their thrombus-targeting performance is  limited. Considering this drawback, we designed a specific bionic system with  enhanced thrombus-targeting ability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the bionic system,  gelatin was chosen as a carrier, and Fe(3)O(4) served as a magnetic navigation  medium and a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging agent. The CREKA peptide, which  targets fibrin, was conjugated to the surface of gelatin to prepare targeted NPs  (TNPs), which were then engulfed by macrophages to construct the bionic system.  At the targeted site, the bionic system released its interior TNPs under  low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) irradiation. Moreover, the targeting  performance was further improved by the conjugated CREKA peptide. RESULTS: In  this study, we successfully constructed a bionic system and demonstrated its  targeting ability in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that most TNPs were  released from macrophages under LIFU irradiation at 2 W/cm(2) for 10 min in  vitro. Additionally, the enhanced thrombus-targeting ability, based on the  natural tropism of macrophages toward inflammatory thrombi, magnetic navigation  and the CREKA peptide, was verified ex vivo and in vivo. Moreover, compared with  the bionic system group, the group treated with TNPs had significantly decreased  liver and spleen signals in MR images and significantly enhanced liver and spleen  signals in fluorescence images, indicating that the bionic system is less likely  to be cleared by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) than TNPs, which may  promote the accumulation of the bionic system at the site of the thrombus.  CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the magnet-guided bionic system with LIFU  responsiveness is an excellent candidate for targeting thrombi and holds promise  as an innovative drug delivery system for thrombolytic therapy.","2022","2024-03-06 17:12:20","2024-03-06T17:12:20Z","","2019-2039","","","17","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Fang et al.","","","","","","PMID: 35558339  PMCID: PMC9087377","","","","*Nanoparticles; *Thrombosis/drug therapy; Bionics; Gelatin; Humans; Magnets; Tropism; bionic system; low-intensity focused ultrasound; macrophage; magnetic navigation; thrombus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present our initial clinical experience with 160  consecutive cases of MRgFUS thalamotomy and describe the clinical outcomes with  long term follow-up. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all patients who  underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy at our institution was performed. CRST Part A tremor  scores were obtained pre-operatively and at each follow-up visit along with an  assessment of side effects (SE). All patients had a post-operative MRI within 24  h to determine the location, size, and extent of the MRgFUS lesion. RESULTS: One  hundred and sixty unilateral MRgFUS Thalamotomies (Left, n = 128; Right, n = 32)  were performed for medically refractory essential Tremor (n = 150) or tremor  predominant Parkinson's disease (n = 10). Mean age at surgery was 75 Years  (range: 48-93) and the mean skull density ratio (SDR) was 0.48 (range: 0.32-0.75;  median: 0.46). In ET patients, both rest and postural tremor was abolished  acutely and remained so at follow-up whereas intention tremor was reduced acutely  by 93% below baseline, 87% at 3 months, 83.0% at 1-year, and 78% at 2 years. On  post-operative day 1, the most common SE's included imbalance (57%), sensory  disturbances (25%), and dysmetria (11%). All adverse events were rated as mild on  the Clavien-Dindo Scale and improved over time. At 2-years follow-up, imbalance  was seen in 18%, sensory disturbance in 10% and dysmetria in 8% patients. Mean  clinical follow-up for all patients was 14 months (range: 1-48 months).  CONCLUSION: MRgFUS thalamotomy is a safe and effective procedure for long term  improvement of unilateral tremor symptoms, with the most common side-effects  being imbalance and sensory disturbance.","2022","2024-03-06 17:12:18","2024-03-06T17:12:18Z","","743649","","","13","","Front Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Lak, Segar, McDannold, White and Cosgrove.","","","","","","PMID: 35250802  PMCID: PMC8894664","","","","Parkinson's disease (PD); essential tremor (ET); focused ultrasound (FUS); thalamotomy; tremor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past 2 decades, the number of scientific  publications on SDT has increased rapidly. However, there is still a lack of one  comprehensive report that summarizes the global research trends and knowledge  landscapes in the field of SDT in detail. Thus, we performed a bibliometric  analysis on SDT from 2000 to 2021 to track the current hotspots and highlight  future directions. Methods: We collected publications on SDT research from the  Web of Science Core Collection database. The annual number of publications and  citations, major contributors, popular journals, international collaborations,  co-cited references and co-occurrence keywords were analyzed and visualized with  CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and R-bibliometrix. Results: A total of 701 publications  were included. The annual publication output increased from 5 in 2000 to 175 in  2021, and the average growth rate was 18.4%. China was the most productive  country with 463 documents (66.05%), and Harbin Medical University was the most  prolific institution (N = 73). Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology published the  most papers related to SDT. Materials Science, and Chemistry were the research  areas receiving the most interest. All the keywords were divided into four  different clusters including studies on mechanisms, studies on drug delivery and  nanoparticles, studies on cancer therapy, as well as studies on ultrasound and  sonosensitizers. In addition to nanomaterials-related studies including  nanoparticles, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, nanosheets, liposomes,  microbubble and TiO(2) nanoparticle, the following research directions such as  immunogenic cell death, metal-organic framework, photothermal therapy, hypoxia,  tumor microenvironment, chemodynamic therapy, combination therapy, tumor  resistance, intensity focused ultrasound, drug delivery, and Staphylococcus  aureus also deserve further attention and may continue to explode in the future.  Conclusion: SDT has a bright future in the field of cancer treatment, and  nanomaterials have increasingly influenced the SDT field with the development of  nano-technology. Overall, this comprehensive bibliometric study was the first  attempt to analyze the field of SDT, which could provide valuable references for  later researchers to better understand the global research trends, hotspots and  frontiers in this domain.","2022","2024-03-06 17:12:06","2024-03-06T17:12:06Z","","1048211","","","13","","Front Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Wu, Cheng, Shen, Lu, Wang, Wang, Wang, Yang, Sun, Guo and Wu.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36699067  PMCID: PMC9868186","","","","bibliometric; cancer; data visualization; nanoparticle; sonodynamic therapy; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We designed a system capable of applying  ultrasound with minimal reflections to neuronal cultures. Synaptic transmission  was pharmacologically controlled, eliminating network effects, enabling  examination of single-cell processes. Short single pulses of low-intensity  ultrasound were applied, and time-locked responses were examined using calcium  imaging. Low-pressure (0.35 MPa) ultrasound directly stimulated ∼20% of  pharmacologically disconnected neurons, regardless of membrane poration.  Stimulation was resistant to the blockade of several purinergic receptor and  mechanosensitive ion channel types. Stimulation was blocked, however, by  suppression of action potentials. Surprisingly, even extremely short (4 μs)  pulses were effective, stimulating ∼8% of the neurons. Lower-pressure pulses  (0.35 MPa) were less effective than higher-pressure ones (0.65 MPa). Attrition  effects dominated, with no indication of compromised viability. Our results  detract from theories implicating cavitation, heating, non-transient membrane  pores >1.5 nm, pre-synaptic release, or gradual effects.

Both bariatric surgery and surgical fat removal have been shown to improve  metabolic health, but the metabolic benefits of nonsurgical fat removal remain  uncertain. The aim of this paper is to establish whether nonsurgical fat removal  exerts measurable, lasting metabolic benefits by way of changes to serum lipid  profiles. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, and clinical trials  registers were searched using the Polyglot Search Translator to find studies  examining quantitative changes in metabolic markers after nonsurgical body  contouring procedures. The MethodologicAl STandard for Epidemiological Research  (MASTER) scale was adopted for the quality assessment of the included studies.  The robust-error meta-regression (REMR) model was employed. RESULTS: Twenty-two  studies and 676 participants were included. Peak body compositions measures  manifest as a reduction of 2 units in body mass index (BMI), 1 kg of body weight  (BW), 5 cm in waist circumference (WC) and 1.5 cm in abdominal fat thickness  (FT), sustained up to 60 days postprocedure. Transient increases of 15 mg/dL in  low-density lipoprotein (LDL), 10 mg/dl in triglycerides (TG), and 15 mg/dl in  total cholesterol (TC) were observed at 2 weeks postprocedure. CONCLUSION: While  nonsurgical fat removal exerts sustained effects on body anthropometrics, changes  to serum lipid profiles were transient. There is no compelling evidence at  present to support the conclusion that nonsurgical fat removal is metabolically  beneficial.","2023-02","2024-03-06 17:11:57","2024-03-06T17:11:57Z","","68-77","","","77","","J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

MR guided focused ultrasound (MR-g-FUS) and  microbubbles have demonstrated safe, temporary, targeted BBB permeabilization  clinically. METHODS: We developed clinically scalable, microbubble drug  conjugates (MDCs) for the viral gene therapy, AAV.SIRT3-myc [adeno-associated  virus expressing myc-tagged SIRT3], which has previously been shown to have  disease modifying effects in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). The lipid  shells of the perfluorocarbon gas MDCs were covalently conjugated to antibodies  with binding specificity to AAVs. Following systemic (iv) delivery of  AAV.SIRT3-myc MDCs, MR-g-FUS was used to deliver SIRT3-myc to brain regions  affected in PD. SIRT3-myc expression was determined post mortem, using  immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: An in vitro, SH-SY5Y cell culture model was used  to show that the localized destruction of MDCs using ultrasound exposures within  biological safety limits dissociated AAV2-GFP (green fluorescent protein) from  the MDCs in the targeted area while maintaining their transduction capacity. In  rats, MR-g-FUS resulted in BBB permeabilization in the striatum and substantia  nigra (SNc). SIRT3-myc was expressed in the striatum, but not the SNc.  CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that MDCs combined with MR-g-FUS are an  effective method for delivery of viral vector gene therapies, such as AAV.SIRT3,  to brain regions affected in PD. This technology may prove useful as a  disease-modifying strategy in PD and other neurodegenerative disorders.","2022-12","2024-03-06 17:11:56","2024-03-06T17:11:56Z","","1176-1183","","1","29","","Drug Deliv","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 35393905  PMCID: PMC9004516","","","","*Drug Delivery Systems; *Parkinson Disease/therapy; *Sirtuin 3/metabolism/pharmacology; Animals; BBB drug delivery; Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism; Brain/metabolism; Dependovirus/genetics; Focused ultrasound; Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Microbubbles; Parkinson’s; Rats; SIRT3; Sirtuin3; microbubbles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior  studies have focused pharmacokinetic analysis on indirect techniques, such as  ultrasound imaging of the blood pool and gas chromatography of exhaled gases. The  goal of this work was to measure the MB concentration directly in blood and  correlate the pharmacokinetic parameters with the MB size and dose. MB volume  dose (MVD) was chosen to combine the size distribution and number into a  single-dose parameter. Different MB sizes (2, 3, and 5 μm diameter) at 5-40 μL/kg  MVD were intravenously injected. Blood samples were withdrawn at different times  (1-10 min) and analyzed by image processing. We found that for an MVD threshold <  40 μL/kg for 2 and 3 μm and <10 μL/kg for 5 μm, MB clearance followed first-order  kinetics. When matching MVD, MBs of different sizes had comparable half-lives,  indicating that gas dissolution and elimination by the lungs are the primary  mechanisms for elimination. Above the MVD threshold, MB clearance followed  biexponential kinetics, suggesting a second elimination mechanism mediated by  organ retention, possibly in the lung, liver, and spleen. In conclusion, we  present the first direct MB pharmacokinetic study, demonstrate the utility of MVD  as a unified dose metric, and provide insights into the mechanisms of MB  clearance from circulation.","2022-04-11","2024-03-06 17:11:55","2024-03-06T17:11:55Z","","1686-1695","","4","8","","ACS Biomater Sci Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 35357814  PMCID: PMC9175185","","","","*Gases; *Microbubbles; *biexponential kinetics; *direct blood measurements; *first-order kinetics; *microbubble pharmacokinetics; *microbubble volume dose; Ultrasonography/methods; biexponential kinetics; direct blood measurements; first-order kinetics; microbubble pharmacokinetics; microbubble volume dose","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Systemic treatment of glioblastoma  remains the most challenging aspect due to the low permeability of the  blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-tumor barrier (BTB), limiting therapeutics  extravasation mainly in the core tumor as well as in its surrounding invading  areas. It is now possible to overcome these barriers by using low-intensity  focused ultrasound (LIFU) together with intravenously administered oscillating  microbubbles (MBs). LIFU is a non-invasive technique using converging ultrasound  waves which can alter the permeability of BBB/BTB to drug delivery in a specific  brain/tumor region. This emerging technique has proven to be both safe and  repeatable without causing injury to the brain parenchyma including neurons and  other structures. Furthermore, LIFU is also approved by the FDA to treat  essential tremors and Parkinson's disease. It is currently under clinical trial  in patients suffering from glioblastoma as a drug delivery strategy and liquid  biopsy for glioblastoma biomarkers. The use of LIFU+MBs is a step-up in the world  of drug delivery, where onco-therapeutics of different molecular sizes and  weights can be delivered directly into the brain/tumor parenchyma. Initially,  several potent drugs targeting glioblastoma were limited to cross the BBB/BTB;  however, using LIFU+MBs, diverse therapeutics showed significantly higher uptake,  improved tumor control, and overall survival among different species. Here, we  highlight the therapeutic approach of LIFU+MBs mediated drug-delivery in the  treatment of glioblastoma.","2022","2024-03-06 17:07:06","2024-03-06T17:07:06Z","","903059","","","12","","Front Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Mungur, Zheng, Wang, Chen, Zhan and Tong.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35677164  PMCID: PMC9169875","","","","blood-brain barrier; blood-tumor barrier (BTB); drug-delivery; glioblastoma; low-intensity focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatment of  LIFU+MB combined with PTX can notably inhibit proliferation as well as increase  apoptosis (p < 0.01) in drug-resistant cells. We proposed that LIFU+MB might  affect the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to PTX by modulating autophagy. To  verify the hypothesis, we analyzed the autophagy level of drug-resistant cells  after the treatment of LIFU+MB and found that autophagy was significantly  inhibited. Altogether, our findings demonstrated that LIFU+MB could reverse PTX  resistance in ovarian cancer via inhibiting autophagy, which provides a novel  strategy to improve chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer.","2022","2024-03-06 17:07:04","2024-03-06T17:07:04Z","","823956","","","12","","Front Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Fan, Qin, Fu, Si, Li, Yang, Wang, Lou and Zhu.","","","","","","PMID: 35574313  PMCID: PMC9098947","","","","autophagy; low-intensity focused ultrasound; microbubble; ovarian cancer; paclitaxel; resistance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about how the neural activity is altered during  social avoidance, and whether it could act as a target of low-intensity focused  ultrasound stimulation (LIFUS) to rescue social deficits. The present study aimed  to investigate the mechanisms of neuronal activities and inflammatory responses  underlying the effect of LIFUS on social avoidance. We found that chronic LIFUS  stimulation can effectively improve social avoidance in the defeated mice.  Calcium imaging recordings by fiber photometry in the defeated mice showed  inhibited ensemble activity during social behaviors. LIFUS instantaneously  triggered the mPFC neuronal activities, and chronic LIFUS significantly enhanced  their neuronal excitation related to social interactions. We further found that  the excessive activation of microglial cells and the overexpression of the  inflammation signaling, i.e. Toll-like receptors(TLR4)/nuclear  factor-kappaB(NF-КB), in mPFC were significantly inhibited by LIFUS. These  results suggest that the LIFUS may inhibit social avoidance behavior by reducing  activation of the inflammatory response, increasing neuronal excitation, and  protecting the integrity of the neuronal structure in the mPFC. Our findings  raised the possibility of LIFUS being applied as novel neuromodulation for social  avoidance treatment in neuropsychiatric diseases.","2022-02-21","2024-03-06 17:07:03","2024-03-06T17:07:03Z","","bhac037","","","","","Cereb Cortex","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2022.

Recently, low-intensity focused ultrasound stimulation (LIFUS) has been found  notable neuroprotective effects on some neurological diseases, including VD.  However, whether it could ameliorate VD-induced working memory impairment was  still not been clarified. The purpose of this study was to address this issue and  the underlying mechanism. We established VD rat model using the bilateral common  carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) and applied the LIFUS (center frequency = 0.5  MHz; I(spta) = 500 mW/cm(2), 10 mins/day) to bilateral medial prefrontal cortex  (mPFC) for 2 weeks since 2 weeks after the surgery. The main results showed that  the LIFUS could significantly improve the performance of VD rats in the specific  working memory tasks (delayed nonmatch-to-sample task and step-down task), which  might be associated with the improved synaptic function. We also found the  improvement in the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and reduced neuroinflammation in  mPFC after LIFUS treatment indicated by the inhibition of Toll-like receptor  (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and the decrease of proinflammatory  cytokines. The amelioration of CBF and neuroinflammation may promote the living  environment of the neurons in VD which then contribute to the survival of neurons  and the improvement in synaptic function. Taken together, our findings indicate  that LIFUS targeted mPFC can effectively ameliorate reward-based spatial working  memory and fear working memory dysfunctions induced by VD via restoring the  living environment, survivability, and synaptic functions of the neurons in mPFC  of VD rats. This study adds to the evidence that LIFUS could become a promising  and non-invasive treatment strategy for the clinical treatment of central nervous  system diseases related to cognitive impairments in the future.","2022","2024-03-06 17:07:01","2024-03-06T17:07:01Z","","814560","","","14","","Front Aging Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Wang, Wang, Wang, Ren, Song, Tian, Zheng, Yang and Ming.","","","","","","PMID: 35264943  PMCID: PMC8899543","","","","cerebral blood flow; low intensity focused ultrasound; neuroinflammation; synaptic function; vascular dementia; working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to  investigate the effects of LIFU in order to alleviate spasticity following spinal  cord injury (SCI) by activating the spinal neurocircuits and increasing the  expression of the neuronal K-Cl cotransporter KCC(2). Adult male Sprague Dawley  (SD) rats (220-300 g) were randomly divided into a sham control group, a LIFU(-)  group, and a LIFU(+) group. The mechanical threshold hold (g) was used to  evaluate the behavioral characteristics of spasm. Electromyography (EMG) was used  to assess activation of the spinal cord neurocircuits and muscle spontaneous  contraction. Spasticity was assessed by frequency-dependent depression (FDD). The  expression of KCC(2) of the lumbar spinal cord was determined via western blot  (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. The spinal cord neurocircuits were  activated by LIFU simulation, which significantly reduced the mechanical  threshold (g), FDD, and EMG recordings (s) after 4 weeks of treatment. WB and IF  staining both demonstrated that the expression of KCC(2) was reduced in the  LIFU(-) group (P < 0.05). After 4 weeks of LIFU stimulation, expression of KCC(2)  had significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the LIFU(+) group compared with the  LIFU(-) group.

Preclinical models addressing sex-specific treatment  differences in the treatment of chronic pain have been limited. Here we examine  the sex-specific effects of low intensity focused ultrasound (liFUS) in a  modified sciatic nerve injury (SNI) model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A modified SNI  performed by ligating the common peroneal nerve (CPN) was used to measure  sensory, behavioral pain responses, and nerve conduction studies in female and  male rats, following liFUS of the L5 dorsal root ganglion. RESULTS: Using the  same dose of liFUS in females and males of the same weight, CPN latency  immediately after treatment was increased for 50 min in females compared to  25 min in males (p < 0.001). Improvements in mechanical pain thresholds after  liFUS lasted significantly longer in females (seven days; p < 0.05) compared to  males (three days; p < 0.05). In females, there was a significant improvement in  depression-like behavior as a result of liFUS (N = 5; p < 0.01); however, because  males never developed depression-like behavior there was no change after liFUS  treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Neuromodulation with liFUS has a greater effect in female  rats on CPN latency, mechanical allodynia duration, and depression-like behavior.  In order to customize neuromodulatory techniques for different patient  phenotypes, it is essential to understand how they may alter sex-specific  pathophysiologies.","2022-06","2024-03-06 17:06:45","2024-03-06T17:06:45Z","","504-510","","4","25","","Neuromodulation","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 International Neuromodulation Society.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were retrospectively included between January 2005  and July 2018 from a prospectively maintained database at a single academic  institution. No patient underwent androgen deprivation therapy prior to HIFU.  Primary endpoint was biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS). Secondary  oncological endpoints included salvage treatment-free survival (STFS),  cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 97  patients met our inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis.

To develop  this technology, it is necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FUS  neuromodulation for specific brain targets and cognitive functions. It is also  important to test whether repeated long-term application of FUS to deep brain  targets improves or degrades behavioral and cognitive function. To this end, we  investigated the effects of FUS in the dorsal striatum of nonhuman primates (NHP)  performing a visual-motor decision-making task for small or large rewards. Over  the course of 2 years, we performed 129 and 147 FUS applications, respectively,  in two NHP. FUS (0.5 MHz @ 0.2-0.8 MPa) was applied to the putamen and caudate in  both hemispheres to evaluate the effects on movement accuracy, motivation,  decision accuracy, and response time. Sonicating the caudate or the putamen  unilaterally resulted in modest but statistically significant improvements in  motivation and decision accuracy, but at the cost of slower reaction times. The  effects were dose (i.e., FUS pressure) and reward dependent. There was no effect  on reaching accuracy, nor was there long-term behavioral impairment or  neurological trauma evident on T1-weighted, T2-weighted, or  susceptibility-weighted MRI scans. Sonication also resulted in significant  changes in resting state functional connectivity between the caudate and multiple  cortical regions. The results indicate that applying FUS to the dorsal striatum  can positively impact the motivational and cognitive aspects of decision making.  The capability of FUS to improve motivation and cognition in NHPs points to its  therapeutic potential in treating a wide variety of human neural diseases, and  warrants further development as a novel technique for non-invasive deep brain  stimulation.","2022-04","2024-03-06 17:06:41","2024-03-06T17:06:41Z","","360-372","","2","15","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

For monitoring the therapy, the  amplitude-modulated (AM) localized motion imaging (LMI) method had been proposed.  This paper compares the performance of AM-LMI while using different sine  modulating wave frequencies and proposes the utilization of square modulating  waves to gain the advantages of both high and low modulating frequencies. A  single element therapy transducer with a 2 MHz central frequency was driven by  sine modulating waves with different frequencies (approximate 34, 67, 102, 168,  and 201 Hz) and by square modulating waves with two frequencies (34 and 67 Hz).  An imaging probe with a 5 MHz central frequency and a 20 MHz sampling frequency  was mounted in the center hole of the therapy transducer to acquire pulse-echo  data, which were used to estimate the tissue oscillation amplitude induced by the  acoustic radiation force of the HIFU beam. The decrease ratio of the oscillation  amount was then utilized to estimate the coagulated lesion length during the  therapy. The comparison of modulating frequencies demonstrated that a higher  frequency could bring higher sensitivity to small lesions, while a lower  frequency not only gives greater noise robustness but also promotes the ability  to estimate lengths of larger lesions. The utilization of a square modulating  wave demonstrated its utility to produce tissue oscillation with multiple  frequencies and gain the advantages of both high and low modulating frequencies.","2022-03","2024-03-06 17:06:39","2024-03-06T17:06:39Z","","106658","","","120","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021.

However,  liposomes are unable to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the brain,  mostly due to their large size (ca. 100 nm). A noninvasive and localised method  of delivering liposomes across the BBB is to intravenously inject microbubbles  and apply long pulses of ultrasound (pulse length: >1 ms) to a targeted brain  region. Recently, we have shown that applying rapid short pulses (RaSP) (pulse  length: 5 μs) can deliver drugs with an improved efficacy and safety profile.  However, this was tested with a relatively smaller 3-kDa molecule (dextran). In  this study, we examine whether RaSP can deliver liposomes to the murine brain in  vivo. Fluorescent DiD-PEGylated liposomes were synthesized and injected  intravenously alongside microbubbles. The left hippocampus of mice was then  sonicated with either a RaSP sequence (5 μs at 1.25 kHz in groups of 10 ms at  0.5 Hz) or a long pulse sequence (10 ms at 0.5 Hz), with each pulse having a  1-MHz centre frequency (0.35 and 0.53 MPa). The delivery and distribution of the  fluorescently-labelled liposomes were assessed by fluorescence imaging of the  brain sections. The safety profile of the sonicated brains was assessed by  histological staining. RaSP was shown to locally deliver liposomes across the BBB  at 0.53 MPa with a more diffused and safer profile compared to the long pulse  ultrasound sequence. Cellular uptake of liposomes was observed in neurons and  microglia, while no uptake within astrocytes was observed in both RaSP and long  pulse-treated brains. This study shows that RaSP allows a targeted and safe  delivery of liposomal drugs into the murine brain with potential to deliver drugs  into neuronal and glial targets.","2022-01","2024-03-06 17:06:37","2024-03-06T17:06:37Z","","605-615","","","341","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Novel treatment modalities able to  release cancer-specific antigens, render immunologically ""cold"" pancreatic  tumours ""hot"" and disrupt or reprogram the pancreatic tumour microenvironment are  thus urgently needed. Therapeutic focused ultrasound exerts thermal and  mechanical effects on tissue, killing cancer cells and inducing an anti-cancer  immune response. The most important advances in therapeutic focused ultrasound  use for initiation and augmentation of the cancer immunity cycle against  pancreatic cancer are described. We provide a comprehensive review of the use of  therapeutic focused ultrasound for the treatment of pancreatic cancer patients  and describe recent studies that have shown an ultrasound-induced anti-cancer  immune response in several tumour models. Published studies that have  investigated the immunological effects of therapeutic focused ultrasound in  pancreatic cancer are described. This article shows that therapeutic focused  ultrasound has been deemed to be a safe technique for treating pancreatic cancer  patients, providing pain relief and improving survival rates in pancreatic cancer  patients. Promotion of an immune response in the clinic and sensitisation of  tumours to the effects of immunotherapy in preclinical models of pancreatic  cancer is shown, making it a promising candidate for use in the clinic.","2022-01-27","2024-03-06 17:06:35","2024-03-06T17:06:35Z","","","","3","14","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 35158903  PMCID: PMC8833696","","","","HIFU; Review; histotripsy; immunotherapy; pancreatic cancer; pancreaticCancer; therapeutic focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spectral changes in the hydrophone sensor signal are currently used to  distinguish stable cavitation from inertial cavitation that can damage theBBB.  Gibbs' ringing, peak intensity loss and peak width increase are well-known  distortions evident when using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to transform  data containing a few hundred points. We investigate overcoming the fact  thatFUStime signals (10 ms providing 312,500 points sampled at 32 ns intervals)  can generate such sharp spectral peaks that variations in theirDFT-related  distortions can significantly impact the values of the key metrics used for  cavitation characterization.Approach:We introduce low-pass filter hardware to  improve how the analogue to digital convertor handles high-frequency noise  components and the orders of magnitude differences betweenFUSharmonic  intensities. We investigate the enhancedFUSspectral stability and resolution  obtained from a new technique, physical sparsification (PH-SP), customized to  thea-prioriinformation that all keyFUScomponents are harmonically related.  Results are compared with standard DFT optimizations involving time data  windowing and Fourier interpolation.Main results:A new simulation model showed  peak intensity, widths and metrics modified by small changes in the transformed  signal's length when removing the noisy starting transient of theFUShydrophone  signal or following minor excitation frequency or sampling rate adjustments. 25%  to 60% area-under-the-curve (AUC) changes occurred in phantom studies across  different pressure levels Spectral peak sharpness was best optimized and  stabilized withPH-SP.Significance:SpecialFUScharacteristics mean starting  transients and minor variations in experimental procedures lead to significant  changes in the spectral metrics used to monitor cavitation levels.  CustomizingPH-SPto these characteristics led to sharper, more stable spectra with  the potential to track the impact of microbubble environment changes.","2022-05-25","2024-03-06 17:06:29","2024-03-06T17:06:29Z","","","","","","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Creative Commons Attribution license.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35613564","","","","*Blood-Brain Barrier; *Microbubbles; Blood-brain barrier (&lt;i&gt;BBB&lt;/i&gt;); Computers; Focused ultrasound (&lt;i&gt;FUS&lt;/i&gt;); Gibbs’ artefact suppression; Phantoms, Imaging; Physical sparsification (&lt;i&gt;PH-SP&lt;/i&gt;); Software; Spectral resolution enhancement; Therapeutic drug passage; blood-brain barrier (BBB); focused ultrasound (FUS); physical sparsification (PH-SP); spectral resolution enhancement; therapeutic drug passage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although MRgFUS is currently approved for the treatment of tremor  in adults, its safety and feasibility profile for intracranial lesions in the  pediatric and young adult population remains unknown. METHODS: The long-term  outcomes of a prospective single-center, single-arm trial of MRgFUS at Nicklaus  Children's Hospital in Miami, Florida, are presented. Patients 15-22 years of age  with centrally located lesions were recruited, clinically consistent with WHO  grade I tumors that require surgical intervention. This cohort consisted of 4  patients with hypothalamic hamartoma (HH), and 1 patient with tuberous sclerosis  complex harboring a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). RESULTS: In each  case, high-intensity FUS was used to target the intracranial lesion. Real-time  MRI was used to monitor the thermoablations. Primary outcomes of interest were  tolerability, feasibility, and safety of FUS. The radiographic ablation volume on  intra- and postoperative MRI was also assessed. All 5 patients tolerated the  procedure without any complications. Successful thermoablation was achieved in 4  of the 5 cases; the calcified SEGA was undertreated due to intratumor  calcification, which prevented attainment of the target ablation temperature. The  HHs underwent target tissue thermoablations that led to MR signal changes at the  treatment site. For the patients harboring HHs, FUS thermoablations occurred  without procedure-related complications and led to improvement in seizure control  or hypothalamic hyperphagia. All 5 patients were discharged home on postoperative  day 1 or 2, without any readmissions. There were no cases of hemorrhage,  electrolyte derangement, endocrinopathy, or new neurological deficit in this  cohort. CONCLUSIONS: This experience demonstrates that FUS thermoablation of  centrally located brain lesions in adolescents and young adults can be performed  safely and that it provides therapeutic benefit for associated symptoms.","2022-01-14","2024-03-06 17:06:24","2024-03-06T17:06:24Z","","1-8","","","","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35171812","","","","ablation; brain tumor; epilepsy; focused ultrasound; functional neurosurgery; hypothalamic hamartoma; pediatric","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A dual-mode conversion technique based on Lamb waves is proposed to  achieve high transmission efficiency. This concept was validated using the finite  element analysis (FEA) and experiments based on changes in the incident angle.  Aluminum, plexiglass, and a human skull were used as materials with different  attenuations. The transmission loss was calculated for each material, and the  results were compared with the reflectance function of the Lamb waves. Oblique  incidence based on dual-mode conversion exhibited a better transmission  efficiency than that of a normal incidence for all of the specimens. The total  transmission losses for the materials were 13.7, 15.46, and 3.91 dB less than  those associated with the normal incidence. A wedge transducer was designed and  fabricated to implement the proposed method.

These nanoprobes varied in size from  58 nm to 321 nm. The bioimaging profiles demonstrated that the proposed  nanoparticles can efficiently eliminate the background light from normal tissue  and show a tumor-specific fluorescence enhancement in the BxPC-3 tumor-bearing  mice models possibly via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. In vivo  tumor USF imaging further proved that these nanoprobes can effectively be  switched 'ON' with enhanced fluorescence in response to a focused ultrasound  stimulation in the tumor microenvironment, contributing to the high-resolution  USF images.

In this paper, we present the analysis of the  dynamics of cavitation bubbles in a viscoelastic medium subjected to a  histotripsy pulse using different fidelities in depicting compressibility and  viscoelasticity effects. The mathematical formulation is described based on the  Keller-Miksis equation in two models for cavitation bubbles in viscoelastic  tissue through histotripsy process; the first model is in neo-Hookean, and the  second is in quadratic law Kelvin-Voigt model. The governing model is solved  analytically based on the modified Plesset-Zwick method. Analysis of the results  reveals that the parameters of Young modulus, viscosity effects and stiffening  parameter reduce the growth of cavitation microbubbles through the histotripsy  process. The cavitation bubble growth increases when the gel concentration  decreases during the histotripsy process.","2022-05-27","2024-03-06 17:00:38","2024-03-06T17:00:38Z","","","","30","34","","J Phys Condens Matter","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35533648","","","","*Keller–Miksis equation; *Microbubbles; *Ultrasonics; *bubble dynamics; *histotripsy; *neo-Hookean model; *quadratic law Kelvin–Voigt; *ultrasonic ablation; *viscoelastic cavitation; Elastic Modulus; Keller–Miksis equation; Viscosity; bubble dynamics; histotripsy; neo-Hookean model; quadratic law Kelvin–Voigt; ultrasonic ablation; viscoelastic cavitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the influence of head tissue, especially the skull, its  attenuation is a key issue affecting precise focusing. The objective of the  present study was to construct a mathematical model of ultrasound attenuation  inclusive of skull thickness. First, combined with real skull phantom experiments  and simulation experiments, tFUS attenuation of different head tissues was  investigated. Furthermore, based on the system identification method, a  mathematical model of ultrasound attenuation was constructed taking skull  thickness into account. Finally, the performance of the mathematical model was  tested, and its potential applications were investigated. For different head  tissues, including scalp, skull, and brain tissue, the skull was found to be the  biggest influencing factor for ultrasound attenuation, the attenuation caused by  it being 4.70 times and 7.06 times that of attenuation caused by the brain and  scalp, respectively. Consistent with the results of both the simulation and  phantom experiments, the attenuation of the mathematical model increased as the  skull thickness increased. The average error of the mathematical model was 1.87%  in the phantom experiment. In addition, the experimental results show that the  devised mathematical model is suitable for different initial pressures and  different skulls with correlation coefficients higher than 0.99. Both simulation  and phantom experiments validated the effectiveness of the proposed mathematical  model. It can be concluded from this experiment that the proposed mathematical  model can accurately calculate the tFUS attenuation and can significantly  contribute to further research and application of tFUS.","2021","2024-03-06 17:00:12","2024-03-06T17:00:12Z","","778616","","","15","","Front Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Guo, Song, Chen, Xu and Ming.","","","","","","PMID: 35250434  PMCID: PMC8891811","","","","attenuation; mathematical model; neuroimaging; neuromodulation; transcranial focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The efficacy of prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in recurrent  cancer has not been established. Furthermore, high-quality data on new minimally  invasive salvage focal ablative treatments are needed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the  role of prostate MRI in detection of prostate cancer recurring after radiotherapy  and the role of salvage focal ablation in treating recurrent disease. DESIGN,  SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The FORECAST trial was both a paired-cohort diagnostic  study evaluating prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and MRI-targeted biopsies  in the detection of recurrent cancer and a cohort study evaluating focal ablation  at six UK centres. A total of 181 patients were recruited, with 155 included in  the MRI analysis and 93 in the focal ablation analysis. INTERVENTION: Patients  underwent choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography and a bone  scan, followed by prostate mpMRI and MRI-targeted and transperineal  template-mapping (TTPM) biopsies. MRI was reported blind to other tests. Those  eligible underwent subsequent focal ablation. An amendment in December 2014  permitted focal ablation in patients with metastases. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Primary outcomes were the sensitivity of MRI and  MRI-targeted biopsies for cancer detection, and urinary incontinence after focal  ablation. A key secondary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS  AND LIMITATIONS: Staging whole-body imaging revealed localised cancer in 128  patients (71%), with involvement of pelvic nodes only in 13 (7%) and metastases  in 38 (21%). The sensitivity of MRI-targeted biopsy was 92% (95% confidence  interval [CI] 83-97%). The specificity and positive and negative predictive  values were 75% (95% CI 45-92%), 94% (95% CI 86-98%), and 65% (95% CI 38-86%),  respectively. Four cancer (6%) were missed by TTPM biopsy and six (8%) were  missed by MRI-targeted biopsy. The overall MRI sensitivity for detection of any  cancer was 94% (95% CI 88-98%). The specificity and positive and negative  predictive values were 18% (95% CI 7-35%), 80% (95% CI 73-87%), and 46% (95% CI  19-75%), respectively. Among 93 patients undergoing focal ablation, urinary  incontinence occurred in 15 (16%) and five (5%) had a grade ≥3 adverse event,  with no rectal injuries. Median follow-up was 27 mo (interquartile range 18-36);  overall PFS was 66% (interquartile range 54-75%) at 24 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Patients  should undergo prostate MRI with both systematic and targeted biopsies to  optimise cancer detection. Focal ablation for areas of intraprostatic recurrence  preserves continence in the majority, with good early cancer control. PATIENT  SUMMARY: We investigated the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of  the prostate and MRI-targeted biopsies in outcomes after cancer-targeted  high-intensity ultrasound or cryotherapy in patients with recurrent cancer after  radiotherapy. Our findings show that these patients should undergo prostate MRI  with both systematic and targeted biopsies and then ablative treatment focused on  areas of recurrent cancer to preserve their quality of life.

METHODS: A  Health Technology Assessment was conducted, assuming the payer's perspective  (Italian National Healthcare Service). The nine EUnetHTA Core Model dimensions  were deeply investigated, by means of i) a literature review; ii) the  implementation of health economics tools (useful for uterine fibroids patients'  clinical pathway economic evaluation, and budget impact analysis), to define  MRgFUS economic and organizational sustainability, and iii) administration of  specific questionnaires filled by uterine fibroids' experts, to gather their  perceptions on the three possible conservative approaches (MRgFUS, UAE and  myomectomy). RESULTS: Literature revealed that MRgFUS would generate several  benefits, from a safety and an efficacy profile, with significant improvement in  symptoms relief. Advantages emerged concerning the patients' perspective, thus  leading to a decrease both in the length of hospital stay (p-value< 0.001), and  in patients' productivity loss (p-value = 0.024). From an economic point of view,  the Italian NHS would present an economic saving of - 6.42%. A positive  organizational and equity impact emerged regarding the capability to treat a  larger number of women, thus performing, on average, 131.852 additional DRGs.

Ablation modalities include high intensity  focused ultrasound, radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and laser  interstitial thermal therapy which are all capable of generating confined zones  of tissue destruction, resulting in fewer complications than conventional cancer  therapies. Oncologic control is contingent upon achieving predefined coagulation  zones; therefore, intraoperative assessment of treatment progress is highly  desirable. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of  ablation monitoring modalities. The first section of this review presents the  mechanism of action and common applications of the primary ablation modalities.  The following section outlines the state-of-the-art in thermal dosimetry which  includes interstitial thermal probes and radiologic imaging. Both the physical  mechanism of measurement and clinical or pre-clinical performance are discussed  for each ablation modality. Thermal dosimetry must be coupled with a thermal  damage model as outlined in Section 4. These models estimate cell death based on  temperature-time history and are inherently tissue specific. In the absence of a  reliable thermal model, the utility of thermal monitoring is greatly reduced. The  final section of this review paper covers technologies that have been developed  to directly assess tissue conditions. These approaches include visualization of  non-perfused tissue with contrast-enhanced imaging, assessment of tissue  mechanical properties using ultrasound and magnetic resonance elastography, and  finally interrogation of tissue optical properties with interstitial probes. In  summary, monitoring thermal ablation is critical for consistent clinical success  and many promising technologies are under development but an optimal solution has  yet to achieve widespread adoption.","2022-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","769-791","","2","49","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34965307","","","","*Catheter Ablation; *Elasticity Imaging Techniques; *Hyperthermia, Induced; *Radiofrequency Ablation; *Soft Tissue Neoplasms; Humans; laser; microwave; monitoring; radiofrequency; thermal ablation; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed  method can be used in the future for treating atherosclerotic plaques in human  arteries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The flat rectangular transducer was firstly  assessed in agar/silica evaporated milk phantom, polyacrylamide phantom and  freshly excised turkeytissue phantom. Then, the same transducer was assessed in  an arterial atherosclerotic plaque phantom which was created in the laboratory  with a very low cost. The recipe of the atherosclerotic plaque phantom was 4% w/v  agar, 1% w/v gypsum, 2% w/v butter and 93% water. The amount of plaque removal  was evaluated visually and using an X-Ray system. RESULTS: It was shown that the  flat rectangular transducer can create thermal lesions on the agar/silica  evaporated milk phantom, polyacrylamide phantom and in excised tissue. The size  of the lesions matches the geometry of the transducer. Moreover, this transducer  destroyed 27.1% of the atherosclerotic plaque phantom with 8 W acoustical power  and 30 s duration. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study demonstrated that  atherosclerotic plaque can be destroyed using a very small flat rectangular  (2 × 10 mm(2)) transducer in a very small time interval of 30 s. In future  clinical trials the transducer will be incorporated in a catheter which will be  inserted intravascular (1-3 mm) wide and can be used to treat atherosclerotic  plaques in the coronary arteries.","2022-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","709-720","","3","25","","J Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Furthermore, multiple clinical trials  have documented the increased loco-regional control in the brain when  radiosurgery is interdigitated with immune check point inhibitors for treatment  of melanoma brain metastases. Mild hyperthermia has been used for decades as an  adjuvant to radiotherapy in the treatment of radiation resistant cancers; lately,  however, thermal therapies, such as hyperthermia, cryoablation, radiofrequency  ablation and high intensity focused ultrasound are being investigated to provide  a new ablative approach to cancer while thermoacoustic imaging and thermometry  have recently been proposed as new techniques for monitoring tissue temperature  in the breast during ablation treatment.

This capacity relies on the ability to  focus acoustic energy through the in-tact skull, a feat that requires accurate  estimates of the acoustic velocity in individual patient skulls. In current  practice, these estimates are generated using a pretreatment computed tomography  (CT) scan and then registered to a magnetic resonance (MR) dataset on the day of  the treatment. Treatment safety and efficacy can be improved by eliminating the  need to register the CT data to the MR images and by improving the accuracy of  acoustic velocity measurements. In this study, we examine the capacity of MR to  supplement or replace CT as a means of estimating velocity in the skull. We find  that MR can predict velocity with less but comparable accuracy to CT. We then use  micro-CT imaging to better understand the limitations of Hounsfield unit  (HU)-based estimates of velocity, demonstrating that the macrostructure of pores  in the skull contributes to the acoustic velocity of the bone. We find evidence  that detailed T2 measurements provide information about pore macrostructure  similar to the information obtained with micro-CT, offering a potential clinical  mechanism for improving patient-specific estimates of acoustic velocity in the  human skull.","2022-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2630-2637","","9","69","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35853046  PMCID: PMC9519088","","","","*Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Acoustics; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Skull","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Notably, clinical trials are underway for treating epilepsy using focused  ultrasound to elicit an organized local electrical response. A key limitation to  this approach is the formation of standing waves within the skull. In standing  acoustic waves, the maximum ultrasound intensity spatially varies from near zero  to double the mean in one half a wavelength, and has lead to localized tissue  damage and disruption of normal brain function while attempting to evoke a  broader response. This phenomenon also produces a large spatial variation in the  actual ultrasound exposure in tissue, leading to heterogeneous results and  challenges with interpreting these effects. One approach to overcome this  limitation is presented herein: transducer-mounted diffusers that result in  spatiotemporally incoherent ultrasound. Herein, we numerically and experimentally  quantified the effect of a diffuser in an enclosed domain, and show that adding  the diffuser leads to a two-fold increase in ultrasound responsiveness of hsTRPA1  transfected HEK cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the diffuser allow us to  produce an uniform spatial distribution of pressure in the rodent skull.

More specifically, this study tests the hypotheses that the  use of the IBCM will (a) not adversely affect image quality, (b) remove aliasing  from small field-of-view scans, and (c) decouple image quality from the motion  state of the coupling fluid. METHODS: An IBCM, whose chemical synthesis and  characterization are reported elsewhere, was used as a coupling medium during  tMRgFUS procedures on gel phantoms. Guidance magnetization-prepared  rapid-gradient-echo (MP-RAGE), TSE, and GRE scans were acquired with fields of  view of 28 and 18 cm. Experiments were repeated with the IBCM in several distinct  flow states. GRE scans were used to estimate temperature time courses as a gel  target was insonated. IBCM performance was measured by computing (i) the root  mean square difference (RMSD) of TSE and GRE pixel values acquired using water  and the IBCM, relative to the use of water; (ii) through-time temperature  uncertainty for GRE scans; and (iii) Bland-Altman analysis of the temperature  time courses. Finally, guidance TSE and GRE scans of a human volunteer were  acquired during a separate sham tMRgFUS procedure. As a control, all experiments  were repeated using a water coupling medium. RESULTS: Use of the IBCM reduced  RMSD in TSE scans by a factor of 4 or more for all fields of view and  nonstationary motion states, but did not reduce RMSD estimates in MP-RAGE scans.  With the coupling media in a stationary state, the IBCM altered estimates of  temperature uncertainty relative to the use of water by less than 0.2°C. However,  with a high flow state, the IBCM reduced temperature uncertainties by the  statistically significant amounts (at the 0.01 level) of 0.5°C (28 cm field of  view) and 5°C (18 cm field of view). Bland-Altman analyses found a 0.1°C ± 0.5°C  difference between temperature estimates acquired using water and the IBCM as  coupling media. Finally, scans of a human volunteer using the IBCM indicate more  conspicuous grey/white matter contrast, a reduction in aliasing, and a less than  0.2°C change in temperature uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an IBCM during  tMRgFUS procedures does not adversely affect image quality for TSE and GRE scans,  can decouple image quality from the motion state of the coupling fluid, and can  remove aliasing from scans where the field of view is set to be much smaller than  the spatial extent of the coupling fluid.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","7373-7383","","12","49","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36156266  PMCID: PMC9946126","","","","*Iron; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Contrast Media; Humans; IBCM; MRI; MRgFUS; MRgHIFU; Phantoms, Imaging; Temperature; Water; coupling medium; focused ultrasound; iron oxide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Values used in the simulations are in  accordance with the non-dimensional physiological numbers. It is found out that  inlet pressure plays a decisive role in bubble lodging; the lower the value, the  higher the possibility of bubble sticking. On the other hand, gravity has a  counteracting effect on bubble lodging in arteries, but not on arterioles. The  initial length of the bubble is not a determining factor in sticking behavior,  even though it affects the flow rate behavior. Surface tension, another critical  factor, has a semi-linear impact on bubble resisting power; lowering the surface  tension will reduce bubble resistance to the flow, diminishing the possibility of  bubble lodging. Finally, it is shown that lower values for the static contact  angle impose higher resistance to the flow.","2022-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","599-618","","2","60","","Med Biol Eng Comput","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

It is helpful in investigating the mid-term grading  efficacy and safety of MRgFUS, and possible risk factors in participants with  painful bone metastases. METHODS: This four-center prospective study enrolled 96  participants between June 2016 and May 2019 with painful bone metastases. The  Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Brief Pain Inventory-Quality of Life (BPI-QoL)  score, morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD), and the adverse events (AEs) were  recorded before and at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after MRgFUS. The  repeated ANOVA tests were used to analyze the change in NRS and BPI-QoL, and  logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the possible risk factors.  RESULTS: A total of 82 participants completed the 3-month follow-up period. And  16 (19.5%) participants were complete responders (CR), 46 (56.1%) participants  were effective responders (ER), and the other 20 (24.4%) participants were  non-responders (NR). The NRS (2.67 ± 2.47 at 3 months compared to 6.38 ± 1.70  before treatment) and BPI-QoL score (3.11 ± 2.51 at 3 months compared to 5.40 ±  1.85 before treatment) significantly decreased after the treatment at all time  points (p < 0.001). Eleven adverse events were recorded and they were all cured  within 1 to 52 days after treatment. The non-perfused volume (NPV) ratio (p =  0.001) and the bone metastases lesion type (p = 0.025) were the key risk factors.  CONCLUSIONS: MRgFUS can be used as a non-invasive, effective, and safe modality  to treat painful bone metastases. NPV ratio and the lesion type may be used as  affecting factors to predict the mid-term efficacy of MRgFUS. KEY POINTS: •  MRgFUS can be considered a non-invasive, effective, and safe modality to treat  painful bone metastases. • The NRS and BPI-QoL score at 1 week, 1 month, 2  months, and 3 months all decreased significantly (p < 0.001) after receiving  MRgFUS. Among 82 participants, 16 (19.5%) were complete responders, 46 (56.1%)  were effective responders, and the other 20 (24.4%) were non-responders. •  According to logistic regression analysis, non-perfused volume ratio and the bone  metastases lesion type were the affecting factors to predict the mid-term  efficacy of MRgFUS. The adjusted OR of non-perfused volume ratio was 0.86 (p =  0.001), and osteoblastic lesion type was 0.06 (p = 0.025).","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1465-1474","","2","33","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Ultrasound examinations performed by trained nurses in the  intensive care unit (ICU) enable more patients to receive these assessments. This  case series evaluates the use of nurse-led focused cardiac and lung ultrasound  for clinical management of ICU patients with COVID-19. We describe common  pathophysiological findings and how findings were used to inform clinical  decision-making. An ultrasound trained ICU nurse performed Focused Ultrasound in  Intensive Care (FUSIC) cardiac and lung scans enabling calculation of a lung  severity score on adult ICU patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in a  single-centre setting. Fifteen scans were performed on 15 patients. Thirteen  (87%) patients had normal left ventricular function; 12 (80%) normal right  ventricular function. All 15 (100%) scans identified abnormal lung findings  including irregular thickened pleura, B-lines, sub-pleural consolidation and  hepatization. Worse lung severity scores were correlated with higher Acute  Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores (r = 0.70; p = .003).  Of the 15 scans, 10 (67%) identified abnormal pathology contributing to a change  in clinical management. This included targeted fluid removal (4, 27%), change in  respiratory management (3, 20%) and need for formal echocardiographic assessment  (3, 20%). Findings from five (33%) scans required no intervention. This case  series demonstrates nurse-led ultrasound could be a useful adjunct in the  management of the COVID-19 patient.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","781-788","","5","28","","Nurs Crit Care","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 British Association of Critical Care Nurses.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36575807  PMCID: PMC9880746","","","","*COVID-19/complications; Adult; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Critical Care/methods; Critical Illness; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Nurse's Role; Point-of-Care Systems; cardiac; lung; nurse-led; point-of-care ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the expanding clinical applications, the major obstacles associated with  MRgFUS still lie in low magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sensitivity and safety  issues. High ultrasound power is required to resist the energy attenuation during  the delivery to the tumor site and may cause damage to the surrounding healthy  tissues. Herein, a surface modification strategy is developed to simultaneously  strengthen MRI and ultrasound ablation of MRgFUS by prolonging Fe(3)O(4)  nanoparticles' blood circulation and tumor-environment-triggered accumulation and  retention at the tumor site. Specifically, reactive oxygen species-labile methoxy  polyethylene glycol and pH-responsive DNA cross-linkers are modified on the  surface of Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles, which can transform nanoparticles into  aggregations through the cascade responsive reactions at the tumor site. Notably,  DNA is selected as the pH-responsive cross-linker because of its superior  biocompatibility as well as the fast and sensitive response to the weak acidity  of 6.5-6.8, corresponding to the extracellular pH of tumor tissues. Due to the  significantly enhanced delivery and retention amount of Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles  at the tumor site, the MRI sensitivity was enhanced by 1.7-fold. In addition, the  ultrasound power was lowered by 35% to reach a sufficient thermal ablation  effect. Overall, this investigation demonstrates a feasible resolution to promote  the MRgFUS treatment by enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and reducing the side  effects, which will be helpful to guide the clinical practice in the future.","2022-07-20","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","31677-31688","","28","14","","ACS Appl Mater Interfaces","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35786850","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Magnetite Nanoparticles; DNA; Fe3O4 nanoparticles; MRgFUS; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; cascade activation; i-motif DNA; tumor accumulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This necessitates early stage diagnosis, which requires  quantitative assessment with a small volume, for effective therapy with low risk  to unwanted development of various diseases. We propose a micro-ultrasonic  diagnosis using an all-optical ultrasound-based spectral sensing (AOUSS)  technique for sensitive and quantitative characterization of early stage and  whole blood coagulation. The AOUSS technique detects and analyzes minute  viscoelastic variations of blood at a micro-ultrasonic spot (<100 μm) defined by  laser-generated focused ultrasound (LGFU). This utilizes (1) a uniquely designed  optical transducer configuration for frequency-spectral matching and wideband  operation (6 dB widths: 7-32 MHz and d.c. ∼ 46 MHz, respectively) and (2) an  empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based signal process particularly adapted to  nonstationary LGFU signals backscattered from the spot. An EMD-derived spectral  analysis enables one to assess viscoelastic variations during the initiation of  fibrin formation, which occurs at a very early stage of blood coagulation (1 min)  with high sensitivity (frequency transition per storage modulus increment = 8.81  MHz/MPa). Our results exhibit strong agreement with those obtained by  conventional rheometry (Pearson's R > 0.95), which are also confirmed by optical  microscopy. The micro-ultrasonic and high-sensitivity detection of AOUSS poses a  potential clinical significance, serving as a screening modality to diagnose  early stage clot formation (e.g., as an indicator for hypercoagulation of blood)  and stages of blood-to-clot transition to check a potential risk for development  into thrombotic diseases.","2022-10-28","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2940-2950","","10","7","","ACS Sens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36107765","","","","*Blood Coagulation; *Ultrasonics; Algorithms; Blood Coagulation Tests/methods; Transducers; all-optical ultrasound; blood coagulation; empirical mode decomposition; laser-generated focused ultrasound; viscoelasticity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the  underlying analgesic mechanisms remain unexplored. Here, we assessed how LIFU at  the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) affects behavior response and central  plasticity resulting from chronic constrictive injury (CCI). The safety of LIFU  stimulation was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Fluoro-Jade C (FJC)  staining. A 21-day ultrasound exposure therapy was conducted from day 91 after  CCI surgery in mice. We assessed the 50% mechanical withdrawal threshold  (MWT(50)) using Von Frey filaments (VFFs). The expression levels of  microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43),  and tau were determined via western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF)  staining to evaluate the central plasticity in ACC. The regions of ACC were  activated effectively and safely by LIFU stimulation, which significantly  increased the number of c-fos-positive cells (P < 0.05) with no bleeding,  coagulative necrosis, and neuronal loss. Under chronic neuropathic pain- (CNP-)  induced allodynia, MWT(50) decreased significantly (P < 0.05), and overexpression  of MAP2, GAP43, and tau was also observed. After 3 weeks of treatment,  significant increases in MWT(50) were found in the CCI+LIFU group compared with  the CCI group (P < 0.05). WB and IF staining both demonstrated a significant  reduction in the expression levels of MAP2, GAP43, and tau (P < 0.05).

However, it remains unclear which patients  would benefit most from an initial conservative rather than interventional  approach. To answer this question, we retrospectively analyzed adult and  pediatric patients with DTs treated at a tertiary academic cancer center between  1992 and 2022. Outcomes measured were progression-free survival (PFS) and time to  next treatment (TTNT) after first-line therapy. A total of 262 treatment-naïve  patients were eligible for analysis with a median age of 36.5 years (range, 0−87  years). The 5-year PFS and the median TTNT (months) after first-line treatment  were, respectively: 50.6% and 69.1 mo for surgery; 64.9% and 149.5 mo for surgery  plus adjuvant radiotherapy; 57.1% and 44.7 mo for surgery plus adjuvant systemic  therapy; 24.9% and 4.4 mo for chemotherapy; 26.7% and 5.3 mo for hormonal  therapy; 41.3% and 29.6 mo for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); 44.4% and 8.9  mo for cryoablation and high intensity focused ultrasound; and 43.1% and 32.7 mo  for active surveillance. Age ≤ 40 years (p < 0.001), DTs involving the  extremities (p < 0.001), a maximum tumor diameter > 60 mm (p = 0.04), and  hormonal therapy (p = 0.03) predicted a higher risk of progression. Overall, our  results suggest that active surveillance should be considered initially for  patients with smaller asymptomatic DTs, while upfront TKIs, local ablation, and  surgery achieve similar outcomes in those with more aggressive disease.","2022-08-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","16","14","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36010900  PMCID: PMC9405618","","","","active surveillance; chemotherapy; cryoablation; desmoid tumor; high intensity focused ultrasound; hormonal therapy; surgery; tyrosine kinase inhibitors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technological advances of the last decades have made it possible to use  new treatments on a larger scale, with good results in terms of safety and  effectiveness. In musculoskeletal field, painful bone metastases are the most  common target of IR palliative treatments; however, in selected cases of bone  metastases, IR may play a curative role, also in combination with other  techniques (surgery, radiation and oncology therapies, etc.). Primary malignant  bone tumors are extremely rare compared with secondary bone lesions:  osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma are the most common; however, the  role of interventional radiology in this fiels is marginal. In this review, the  main techniques used in interventional radiology were examined, and advantages  and limitations illustrated. Techniques of ablation (Radiofrequency, Microwaves,  Cryoablation as also magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity focused  ultrasound), embolization, and Cementoplasty will be described. The techniques of  ablation work by destruction of pathological tissue by thermal energy (by an  increase of temperature up to 90 °C with the exception of the Cryoablation that  works by freezing the tissue up to -40 °C). Embolization creates an ischemic  necrosis by the occlusion of the arterial vessels that feed the tumor. Finally,  cementoplasty has the aim of strengthening bone segment weakened by the growth of  pathological tissue through the injection of cement. The results of the  treatments performed so far were also assessed and presented focused the  attention on the management of bone metastasis.","2022-06-07","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","12","11","","J Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35743336  PMCID: PMC9225477","","","","bone metastases; electrochemotherapy; interventional radiology; magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound; thermal ablation; tumour embolization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To  investigate the effects of MRgFUS in patients with ET with an emphasis on  ipsilateral-hand and axial tremor subscores. METHODS: Tremor scores and adverse  effects of 100 patients treated between 2012 and 2018 were assessed at 1 week, 3,  12, and 24 months. A subgroup analysis of ipsilateral-hand tremor responders  (defined as patients with ≥30% improvement at any time point) and non-responders  was performed. Correlations and predictive factors for improvement were analysed.  Weighted probabilistic maps of improvement were generated. RESULTS: Significant  improvement in axial, contralateral-hand and total tremor scores was observed at  all study visits from baseline (p<0.0001). There was no significant improvement  in ipsilateral subscores. A subset of patients (n=20) exhibited group-level  ipsilateral-hand improvement that remained significant through all follow-ups  (p<0.001).

CONCLUSION: MRgFUS  significantly improved axial, contralateral-hand and total tremor scores. In a  subset of patients, a consistent group-level treatment effect was observed for  ipsilateral-hand tremor.

Despite intensive research in the field of  therapeutics, the 5-year overall survival is approximately 8%, with only 20% of  patients eligible for surgery at the time of diagnosis. The tumoral  microenvironment (TME) of the PDAC is one of the main causes for resistance to  antitumoral treatments due to the presence of tumor vasculature, stroma, and a  modified immune response. The TME of PDAC is characterized by high stiffness due  to fibrosis, with hypo microvascular perfusion, along with an immunosuppressive  environment that constitutes a barrier to effective antitumoral treatment. While  systemic therapies often produce severe side effects that can alter patients'  quality of life, locoregional therapies have gained attention since their action  is localized to the pancreas and can thus alleviate some of the barriers to  effective antitumoral treatment due to their physical effects. Local hyperthermia  using radiofrequency ablation and radiation therapy - most commonly using a local  high single dose - are the two main modalities holding promise for clinical  efficacy. Recently, irreversible electroporation and focused ultrasound-derived  cavitation have gained increasing attention. To date, most of the data are  limited to preclinical studies, but ongoing clinical trials may help better  define the role of these locoregional therapies in the management of PDAC  patients.","2022-04-07","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1288-1303","","13","28","","World J Gastroenterol","","","","","","","","eng","©The Author(s) 2022.

How this treatment  affects canonical brain networks has not been elucidated. The purpose of this  study was to clarify changes of brain networks after MRgFUS thalamotomy in ET  patients by analyzing resting-state networks (RSNs). METHODS: Fifteen patients  with ET were included in this study. Left MRgFUS thalamotomy was performed in all  cases, and MR images, including resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), were taken  before and after surgery. MR images of 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls  (HCs) were also used for analysis. Using rsfMRI data, canonical RSNs were  extracted by performing dual regression analysis, and the functional connectivity  (FC) within respective networks was compared among pre-MRgFUS patients,  post-MRgFUS patients, and HCs. The severity of tremor was evaluated using the  Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) score pre- and postoperatively, and its  correlation with RSNs was examined. RESULTS: Preoperatively, ET patients showed a  significant decrease in FC in the sensorimotor network (SMN), primary visual  network (VN), and visuospatial network (VSN) compared with HCs. The decrease in  FC in the SMN correlated with the severity of tremor. After MRgFUS thalamotomy,  ET patients still exhibited a significant decrease in FC in a small area of the  SMN, but they exhibited an increase in the cerebellar network (CN). In comparison  between pre- and post-MRgFUS patients, the FC in the SMN and the VSN  significantly increased after treatment. Quantitative evaluation of the FCs in  these three groups showed that the SMN and VSN increased postoperatively and  demonstrated a trend toward those of HCs. CONCLUSIONS: The SMN and CN, which are  considered to be associated with the cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop, exhibited  increased connectivity after MRgFUS thalamotomy. In addition, the FC of the  visual network, which declined in ET patients compared with HCs, tended to  normalize postoperatively. This could be related to the hypothesis that visual  feedback is involved in tremor severity in ET patients. Overall, the analysis of  the RSNs by rsfMRI reflected the pathophysiology with the intervention of MRgFUS  thalamotomy in ET patients and demonstrated a possibility of a biomarker for  successful treatment.","2023-02-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","306-317","","2","138","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35901706","","","","*Essential Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Thalamus/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Tremor; essential tremor; functional neurosurgery; magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy; resting-state networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to ultrasound  (US) with specific parameters, and electrocardiograms were recorded to analyze  the effect of LIFU and/or vagal denervation on heart rate. Thereafter, myocardial  infarction (MI) was induced by left anterior artery ligation, and LIFU was  performed three times a day for 25 days after MI. Echocardiography, Masson  staining, and ELISA were used to evaluate the effect of LIFU on the structure and  function of the heart. Finally, ELISA, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and Western blot  analysis were performed to determine the effect of LIFU on the inflammation and  the expression of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP)-related  mediators. RESULTS: LIFU reduced heart rate in rats (control vs LIFU, P < .01),  and vagotomy (VT) eliminated this effect of LIFU on heart rate (VT vs LIFU + VT,  P > .01). LIFU-ameliorated IHF in terms of cardiac structure and function (MI vs  MI + LIFU, P < .01), but VT abrogated the beneficial effect of LIFU (MI + VT vs  MI + LIFU + VT, P > .01). After the treatment of LIFU, decreased levels of  inflammatory cytokines, increased proportion of anti-inflammatory macrophages,  and increased expression of CAP-related mediators (MI vs MI + LIFU, P < .01).  CONCLUSIONS: LIFU ameliorates IHF whereas the CAP plays a promising role. LIFU  has the potential to be a novel nonpharmacological and noninvasive therapy for  the treatment of coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular diseases.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","463-475","","2","42","","J Ultrasound Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36444908","","","","*Heart Failure/diagnostic imaging/therapy; *Myocardial Infarction/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/metabolism; AchRα7; Animals; HMGB1; Heart; Neuroimmunomodulation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; TNF-α; cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway; ischemic heart failure; low-intensity focused ultrasound; vagus nerve","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, 14  Sprague Dawley rats underwent the BH treatment and were sacrificed on days 0, 3,  7, 14, and 28 for morphological, histological, serological and qPCR analyses. The  area of the treated region was 1.44 cm(2) (1.2 cm × 1.2 cm). A well-defined BH  lesion filled with coagulated blood formed on day 0. A week after the treatment,  fibroblast activation was induced at the treatment site, leading to the formation  of extracellular matrix structure (ECM). The ECM was then disrupted for 7 to  28 days. Regenerated normal hepatocytes and newly formed blood vessels were found  within the BH region with the absence of hepatic fibrosis. No significant  morphological, histological and genetic changes around the BH lesion occurred.  These results suggest that BH could be a safe and promising therapeutic tool for  treating solid tumours without inducing any significant adverse effect such as  the formation of liver fibrosis.","2022-08-24","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","14462","","1","12","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

However, the hypoxic tumor microenvironment,  especially deep-seated tumors distant from blood vessels, severely restricts  therapeutic efficacy due to the oxygen-dependent manner of SDT. METHODS: Herein,  we report a novel ultrasonic cavitation effect-based therapeutic modality that is  able to facilitate the hypoxia-tolerant SDT for inducing hypoxic tumor death. A  tLyP-1 functionalized liposomes is fabricated, composed of hematoporphyrin  monomethyl ether gadolinium as the sonosentizer and perfluoropentane (PFP) as the  acoustic environment regulator. Moreover, the tLyP-1 functioned liposomes could  achieve active tumor homing and effective deep-penetrating into hypoxic tumors.  Upon low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) irradiation, the acoustic droplet  vaporization effect of PFP induced fast liquid-to-gas transition and quick  bubbles explosion to generate hydroxyl radicals, efficiently promoting cell death  in both normoxic and hypoxic microenvironment (acting as deep-penetration  nanobomb, DPNB). RESULTS: The loading of PFP is proved to significantly enhance  the therapeutic efficacy of hypoxic tumors. In particular, these DPNB can also  act as ultrasound, photoacoustic, magnetic resonance, and near-infrared  fluorescence tetramodal imaging agents for guiding the therapeutic process.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred and fifty consecutive patients with  intermediate-risk PCa, treated between 2009 and 2018 at a single center were  included. Primary study outcome was failure-free survival (FFS), defined as  absence of additional treatment, systemic progression or prostate cancer related  death. RESULTS: Thirty-seven (25%) patients underwent cryotherapy and 113 (75%)  HIFU. Median age was 69 (IQR 62-72) years, with 36 (24%) presenting palpable  disease on rectal examination, and median total PSA of 7.85 (IQR 5.75-10.62)  ng/mL.

Here, a methodology to execute aberration  correction in vivo is proposed. A custom BH system consisting of a 1.5-MHz phased  array of 256 elements connected to a Verasonics V1 system is used in pulse/echo  mode on a porcine model under general anesthesia. Estimation of the time shifts  needed to correct for aberration in the liver and kidney is done by maximizing  the value of the coherence factor on the acquired backscattered signals. As this  process requires multiple pulse/echo sequences on a moving target to converge to  a solution, tracking is also implemented to ensure that the same target is used  between each iteration. The method was validated by comparing the acoustic power  needed to generate a boiling bubble at one target with aberration correction and  at another target within a 5-mm radius without aberration correction. Results  show that the aberration correction effectively lowers the acoustic power  required to reach boiling by up to 45%, confirming that it indeed restored  formation of the nonlinear shock front at the focus.","2022-10","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2955-2964","","10","69","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35981067  PMCID: PMC9714798","","","","*Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; Abdomen; Animals; Kidney; Liver/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Swine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pulsing scheme and mechanisms of BH differ from those of cavitation cloud  histotripsy, which was previously developed for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The  goal of the work described here was to evaluate the feasibility of using BH to  ablate fresh ex vivo human prostate tissue as a proof of principle for developing  BH for prostate applications. Fresh human prostate samples (N = 24) were obtained  via rapid autopsy (<24 h after death, institutional review board exempt). Samples  were analyzed using shear wave elastography to ensure that mechanical properties  of autopsy tissue were clinically representative. Samples were exposed to BH  using 10- or 1-ms pulses with 1% duty cycle under real-time B-mode and Doppler  imaging. Volumetric lesions were created by sonicating 1-4 rectangular planes  spaced 1 mm apart, containing a grid of foci spaced 1-2 mm apart. Tissue then was  evaluated grossly and histologically, and the lesion content was analyzed using  transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Observed shear  wave elastography characterization of ex vivo prostate tissue (37.9 ± 22.2 kPa)  was within the typical range observed clinically. During BH, hyperechoic regions  were visualized at the focus on B-mode, and BH-induced bubbles were also detected  using power Doppler. As treatment progressed, hypoechoic regions of tissue  appeared, suggesting successful tissue fractionation. BH treatment was twofold  faster using shorter pulses (1 ms vs. 10 ms). Histological analysis revealed  lesions containing completely homogenized cell debris, consistent with  histotripsy-induced mechanical ablation. It was therefore determined that BH is  feasible in fresh ex vivo human prostate tissue producing desired mechanical  ablation. The study supports further work aimed at translating BH technology as a  clinical option for prostate ablation.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","62-71","","1","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Boiling histotripsy (BH) is a novel high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) application currently being developed for non-invasive mechanical  fractionation of soft tissues and large hematomas. In the context of development  of BH treatment planning approaches for ablating targets adjacent to  gas-containing organs, this study aimed at investigation of the ultrasound  pressure thresholds of atomization-induced damage to the tissue-air interface and  correlation of the danger zone dimensions with spatial structure of nonlinear  HIFU field parameters.Approach. A flat interface with air of freshly clotted  bovine blood was used as anex vivomodel due to its homogenous structure and  higher susceptibility to ultrasound-induced mechanical damage compared to soft  tissues. Three 1.5 MHz transducers of differentF-numbers (0.77, 1 and 1.5) were  focused at various distances before or beyond a flat clot surface, and a BH  exposure was delivered either at constant, high-amplitude output level, or at  gradually increasing level until a visible damage to the clot surface occurred.  The HIFU pressure field parameters at the clot surface were determined through a  combination of hydrophone measurements in water, forward wave propagation  simulation using 'HIFU beam' software and an image source method to account for  the wave reflection from the clot surface and formation of a standing wave. The  iso-levels of peak negative pressure in the resulting HIFU field were correlated  to the outlines of surface erosion to identify the danger zone around the BH  focus.Main results. The outline of the danger zone was shown to differ from that  of a typical BH lesion produced in a volume of clot material. In the prefocal  area, the zone was confined within the 4 MPa contour of the incident peak-to-peak  pressure; within the main focal lobe it was determined by the maximum BH lesion  width, and in the postfocal area-by the transverse size of the focal lobe and  position of the first postfocal pressure axial null.Significance. The incident  HIFU pressure-based danger zone boundaries were outlined around the BH focus and  can be superimposed onto in-treatment ultrasound image to avoid damage to  adjacent gas-containing bodies.","2022-10-20","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","21","67","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36179703  PMCID: PMC9645587","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/adverse effects/methods; Animals; Cattle; HIFU; Hematoma/diagnostic imaging/etiology; Transducers; Ultrasonography; Water; boiling histotripsy; hematoma liquefaction; mechanical tissue ablation; non-invasive surgery; ultrasonic atomization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methylene blue (MB), an antioxidant, has emerged as a  potential drug for the treatment of AD owing to its cognitive improvement and  neuroprotective functions. Despite the small molecular size of MB, which can  cross the BBB, the therapeutic effective dosage using a BBB-permeable delivery  system in a specific brain localization remains unclear. In this study, we  presented magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) as a delivery  system to enhance BBB permeability for the effective treatment of AD. MRgFUS  using two ultrasound intensities (0.25 and 0.32 MPa) was used to intravenously  deliver MB to the hippocampal region. Compared with treatment with 0.25 MPa FUS,  treatment with 0.32 MPa FUS significantly enhanced MB brain accumulation.  Deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neural cell damage was significantly  reduced in 0.32 MPa FUS/MB-treated APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, aquaporin-4  expression increased significantly in the 0.32 MPa FUS and 0.32 MPa FUS/MB groups  without glial fibrillary acidic protein activation.

This study  aims to investigate the potential of focused ultrasound-mediated intranasal  delivery (FUSIN) in AAV delivery to brain. METHODS: Mice were intranasally  administered with AAV5 encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (AAV5-EGFP)  followed by FUS sonication in the presence of systemically injected microbubbles.  Mouse brains and other major organs were harvested for immunohistological  staining, PCR quantification, and in situ hybridization. The AAV delivery  outcomes were compared with those of DI, FUS-BBBD, and IN delivery. FINDINGS:  FUSIN achieved safe and efficient delivery of AAV5-EGFP to spatially targeted  brain locations, including a superficial brain site (cortex) and a deep brain  region (brainstem). FUSIN achieved comparable delivery outcomes as the  established DI, and displayed 414.9-fold and 2073.7-fold higher delivery  efficiency than FUS-BBBD and IN. FUSIN was associated with minimal  biodistribution in peripheral organs, which was comparable to that of DI.  INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that FUSIN is a promising technique for  non-invasive, efficient, safe, and spatially targeted AAV delivery to the brain.

Early and effective recovery of coronary  microcirculation perfusion for the management of AMI would be crucial for better  prognosis. Ultrasound assisted thrombolysis in the in-vitro experiments have  great potential for the elimination of acute coronary microthromboembolism,  especially with stable cavitation using low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)  and dodecafluoropentane-loaded acoustic phase-change nanoparticles (DDFP@NPs).  Therefore, our study sought to perform animal experiments using this novel  treatment method in a porcine model with acute coronary microthromboembolism for  further investigation of potential therapeutic values. METHODS: Porcine model  with acute coronary thromboembolism was established using percutaneous coronary  intervention and autologous thrombus injection. For ultrasound assisted  thrombolysis, DDFP@NPs were prepared by rotary evaporation and sonication  process, and LIFU was optimized. Echocardiography and TTC staining were performed  for the evaluation of porcine model establishment and treatment effect. RESULTS:  The treatment using LIFU guided DDFP@NPs had almost completely recanalized  culprit coronary branch after treatment procedure, and smaller infarcted size  (5.4 ± 1.0%), better LVEF (52.5 ± 1.8%) and better coronary microcirculation  after 28 days of treatment, which outperformed treatments using LIFU+SonoVue  microbubbles (infarcted size: 26.4 ± 3.5% and LVEF: 37.2 ± 3.1%) and LIFU only  (infarcted size: 32.2 ± 3.1% and LVEF: 32.2 ± 0.4%) (all P < 0.05), while the  treatment effect were similar to treatment using intravenous tissue-plasminogen  activator (infarcted size: 4.9 ± 0.9% and LVEF: 53.1 ± 1.1%) (all P > 0.05).  CONCLUSIONS: Our study has innovatively established a treatment method using  DDFP@NPs combined with LIFU irradiation for coronary thrombolysis and verified  its treatment effect with high-efficient thrombolysis in the in-vivo experiments,  which can be considered as powerful experimental evident of the novel method for  potential clinical use of acute coronary thrombolysis. Multidimensional  experimental investigations and cautious verification may need before the method  could be used as treatment before preliminary clinical trials.","2023-01-15","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1-9","","","371","","Int J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

We employ  Zeldovich's hydrodynamic approach to obtain a description of bubble nuclei that  grow simultaneously via hydrodynamic excitation by the acoustic field and vapour  transport. By quantifying the relative dominance of both mechanisms, it is then  possible to discern the extent to which viscosity, inertia, surface tension and  vapour transport shape the growth of bubble nuclei through non-dimensional  numbers that naturally arise within the theory. The first non-dimensional number  Φ(1)(2)/Φ(2) is analogous to the Laplace number, representing the balance between  surface tension and inertial constraints to viscous effects. The second  non-dimensional number δ represents how enthalpy transport into the bubble can  reduce nucleation rates by cooling the surrounding liquid. This formulation adds  to the current understanding of ultrasound bubble nucleation by accounting for  bubble dynamics during nucleation, quantifying the physical distinctions between  ""boiling"" and ""cavitation"" bubbles through non-dimensional parameters, and  outlining the characteristic timescales of nucleation according to the growth  mechanism of bubbles throughout the histotripsy temperature range. We observed in  our simulations that viscous effects control the process of ultrasound nucleation  in water-like media throughout the 0-120 °C temperature range, although this  dominance decreases with increasing temperatures. Enthalpy transport was found to  reduce nucleation rates for increasing temperatures. This effect becomes  significant at temperatures above 30 °C and favours the creation of fewer nuclei  that are larger in size. Conversely, negligible enthalpy transport at lower  temperatures can enable the nucleation of dense clusters of small nuclei, such as  cavitation clouds. We find that nuclei growth as modelled by the Rayleigh-Plesset  equation occurs over shorter timescales than as modelled by vapour-dominated  growth. This suggests that the first stage of bubble nuclei growth is  hydrodynamic, and vapour transport effects can only be observed over longer  timescales. Finally, we propose that this framework can be used for comparison  between different experiments in bubble nucleation, towards standardisation and  dosimetry of protocols.","2022-08","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","106091","","","88","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

However, a clinical  transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) system does not provide this modality yet.  The study aimed at the development of the transcranial FUS technique dedicated  for large-volume mild hyperthermia in the brain. Acoustic pressure,  multiple-foci, temperature and thermal dose induced by FUS were simulated in the  brain through the skull. A 1-MHz, 114-element, spherical helmet transducer was  fabricated to verify large-volume hyperthermia in the phantom. The simulated  results showed that two foci were simultaneously formed at (2, 0, 0) and (-2, 0,  0) and at (0, 2, 0) and (0, -2, 0), using the phases of focusing pattern 1 and  the phases of focusing pattern 2, respectively. Switching two focusing patterns  at 5 Hz produced a hyperthermic zone with an ellipsoid of 7 mm × 6 mm × 11 mm in  the brain and the temperature was 41-45 °C in the ellipsoid as the maximum  intensity was 150 W/cm(2) and sonication time was 3 min. The phased array driven  by switching two mode phases generated a 41 °C-contour region of 10 ± 1 mm × 8 ±  2 mm × 13 ± 2 mm in the phantom after 3-min sonication.

GTN in the cesarean scar is a rare  entity, but most cases need to be treated with hysterectomy or localized uterine  lesion resection because of chemoresistant lesions and/or massive bleeding. We  present a patient with post-molar GTN in the cesarean scar who was non-invasively  treated with ultrasound-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to  preserve the uterus and fertility. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old woman was  diagnosed with low-risk GTN (FIGO Stage I: 2 prognostic score) after partial  hydatidiform mole. The 5th cycle of chemotherapy was interrupted because of  persistent hepatic toxicity and impaired ovarian reserve function. However, the  uterine lesion persisted (diameter of residual uterine lesion in the cesarean  scar: 2.0 cm). Therefore, ultrasound-guided HIFU treatment was performed. A  significant gray-scale change was observed during the HIFU treatment. Color  Doppler ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was performed to  evaluate the ablation effectiveness. Color Doppler ultrasonography showed  disappearance of the signal of vascularity and CEUS showed no perfusion in the  lesion located in the cesarean scar. The uterine lesion was obviously shrunken  one month after HIFU treatment. Menstrual cycle resumed 48 days after HIFU. HIFU  treatment decreased the number of chemotherapy cycles and there was complete  disappearance of the GTN lesion at 4-month follow-up. The patient has shown no  signs of recurrence as of 58-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided HIFU  may be a useful alternative to lesion resection for GTN in the cesarean scar in  patients who show chemoresistance or are not suitable for chemotherapy. It has  the potential to ablate the residual uterine lesion noninvasively to preserve the  uterus and fertility, avoiding perioperative risks of lesion resection,  especially acute bleeding.","2022-12-15","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","522","","1","22","","BMC Womens Health","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

METHODS: We collected patients with single uterine fibroid receiving  HIFU ablation from January 2018 to April 2021. All enrolled patients were  classified into three group: group A (no pre-HIFU medication use), group B  (Pre-HIFU letrozole use), group C (pre-HIFU gonadotrophin releasing hormone  analog, GnRHa). Further associated clinical data and treatment response after  HIFU treatment were reviewed and evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients  including 21, 7, and 11 in group A, B, and C were collected respectively. After  pre-HIFU medication, no difference of fibroid volume was found (A: 251.4, B:  360.6, C: 409.4 cm(3), p = 0.250), and GnRHa group had significantly larger  volume reduction than Letrozole users (38.6% vs. 16.4%, p = 0.007). The incidence  of hypoestrogenic symptoms was higher in GnRHa group than in letrozole users  (27.3% vs. 0, p = 0.170). GnRHa group had more sonication time (p = 0.001),  treatment duration (p = 0.002), and ablated energy (p = 0.001) than group A and  B.

Despite its great potential, several aspects of UNM are still  unknown. An important question pertains to the off-target sensory effects of UNM  and their dependence on stimulation frequency. To understand these effects, we  have developed a finite-element model of a mouse, including elasticity and  viscoelasticity, and used it to interrogate the response of mouse models to  focused ultrasound (FUS). We find that, while some degree of focusing and  magnification of the signal is achieved within the brain, the induced  pressure-wave pattern is complex and delocalized. In addition, we find that the  brain is largely insulated, or 'cloaked', from shear waves by the cranium and  that the shear waves are largely carried away from the skull by the vertebral  column, which acts as a waveguide. We find that, as expected, this waveguide  mechanism is strongly frequency dependent, which may contribute to the frequency  dependence of UNM effects. Our calculations further suggest that off-target skin  locations experience displacements and stresses at levels that, while greatly  attenuated from the source, could nevertheless induce sensory responses in the  subject.","2022-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","101539","","","50","","Extreme Mech Lett","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38170107  PMCID: PMC10760995","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are published studies to  discuss the efficacy and safety of the different ultrasound parameters,  microbubble dosages and sizes, and sonication schemes on BBB disruption, but  optimal the paradigm is still under investigation. Our study is aimed to  investigate how different sonication parameters, time, and microbubble dose can  affect BBB disruption, the dynamics of BBB disruption, and the efficacy of  different sonication schemes on BBB disruption. Method: We used pulsed weakly  focused ultrasound to open the BBB of C57/B6 mice. Evans blue dye (EBD) was used  to determine the degree of BBB disruption. With a given acoustic pressure of 0.56  MPa and pulse repetitive frequency of 1 Hz, burst lengths of 10 ms to 50 ms,  microbubbles of 100 μL/kg to 300 μL/kg, and sonication times of 60 s to 150 s  were used to open the BBB for parameter study. Brain EBD accumulation was  measured at 1, 4, and 24 h after sonication for the time-response relationship  study; EBD of 100 mg/kg to 200 mg/kg was administered for the dose-response  relationship study; EBD injection 0 to 6 h after sonication was performed for the  BBB disruption dynamic study; brain EBD accumulation induced by one sonication  and two sonications was investigated to study the effectiveness on BBB  disruption; and a histology study was performed for brain tissue damage  evaluation. Results: Pulsed weakly focused ultrasound opens the BBB extensively.  Longer burst lengths and a larger microbubble dose result in a higher degree of  BBB disruption; a sonication time longer than 60 s did not increase BBB  disruption; brain EBD accumulation peaks 1 h after sonication and remains 81% of  the peak level 24 h after sonication; the EBD dose administered correlates with  brain EBD accumulation; BBB disruption decreases as time goes on after sonication  and lasts for 6 h at least; and brain EBD accumulation induced by two sonication  increases 74.8% of that induced by one sonication. There was limited adverse  effects associated with sonication, including petechial hemorrhages and mild  neuronal degeneration. Conclusions: BBB can be opened extensively and reversibly  by pulsed weakly focused ultrasound with limited brain tissue damage. Since EBD  combines with albumin in plasma to form a conjugate of 83 kDa, these results may  simulate ultrasound-induced brain delivery of therapeutic molecules of this size  scale. The result of our study may contribute to finding the optimal paradigm of  focused ultrasound-induced BBB disruption.","2022-06-06","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","6","14","","Pharmaceutics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35745780  PMCID: PMC9227051","","","","Evans blue dye; blood–brain barrier; brain drug delivery; brain tumors; focused ultrasound; microbubbles; neurodegenerative diseases; pulsed-wave low-dose ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among all  patients, 19 (38%) underwent salvage treatments (median [95% confidence interval]  STFS 53 [44.3-61.7] mo). MFS and OS were 100% and 98%, respectively. The Expanded  Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 sexual domain decreased by 20.8 points (p =  0.372). CONCLUSIONS: MRI/TRUS-guided focal HIFU therapy results in complete  cancer ablation in only half of the treated patients after 1 yr, with further  recurrences at medium-term follow-up. A decline of potency occurs in a subset of  patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: Focal image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound  therapy controls cancer in one of two patients. Its impact on urinary continence  and erectile function is low.","2023-03","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","283-290","","2","9","","Eur Urol Focus","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 European Association of Urology.

From June 2014 to March 2020, 15 patients with  consecutive unresectable and recurrent diseases that pathologically proven to be  intra-abdominal desmoid tumors had undergone the treatment of US-guided HIFU  ablation. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging  before and after HIFU treatment. Nonperfused volume ratio was used to evaluate  the effect of HIFU therapy. Intraprocedural and postprocedural adverse effects  and complications are recorded to assess the safety of the therapy. Outcome of  HIFU ablation has been investigated through serial contrast-enhanced imaging  examinations during follow up. Out of 15 patients 14 of them have successfully  completed the whole therapy, 1 patient is ineffective and gives up further  treatment. The mean nonperfused volume ratio is 71.1% (95% confidence interval,  3% to 88.2%). During a mean follow up of 29 months (range from 8 to 61 months),  the mean tumor volume was reduced by 59% (95% confidence interval, +49% to  -100%). No tumor spreads along the treated area in all patients except one.  Complications have occurred in 5 patients (33.3%), including bowel rupture (1  case), intra-abdominal abscess (1 case), slight injury to the femoral nerve (1  case), and bone injury (2 cases), the bowel rupture patient underwent surgery;  the others have been cured during the follow up.

METHODS: A total of 12 physicians and 720 cases  were equally assigned to the learning group and the control group, with 6  physicians and 360 cases per group. The learning group was treated by physicians  without HIFU experience and the control group was treated by experienced  physicians. Nonperfused volume (NPV) ratio was assessed by contrast-enhanced  magnetic resonance imaging. Technical failure was defined as NPV ratio of uterine  fibroids <70% and/or major complication, while <80% was set as a stricter  standard of training qualification. LC-CUSUM was used to analyze the learning  curve. RESULTS: Physicians with or without HIFU experience in both groups  achieved matchable NPV ratios, where a NPV ratio of 92.52% (16.06) was achieved  by experienced physicians and 93.82% (16.95) by inexperienced physicians. No  major complication was observed. The results of LC-CUSUM analysis showed that,  with the standards of the NPV ratio of 70% or 80%, the learning group mastered  the technique on the 11th case and the 16th case, respectively, while the control  group was stable. CONCLUSIONS: HIFU technology stayed stable in operation, with  good safety and sound effectiveness, and was easy to learn.

High-intensity focused ultrasound  (HIFU) is a completely noninvasive ablation therapy that can be used to ablate  tumors either by heating (thermal (T)-HIFU) or by mechanical disruption  (mechanical (M)-HIFU). How different HIFU ablation techniques compare with  respect to their antigen release profile, their activation of responder T cells,  and their ability to synergize with immune stimuli remains to be elucidated.  METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we compare the immunomodulatory effects of T-HIFU and  M-HIFU ablation with or without the TLR9 agonist CpG in the ovalbumin-expressing  lymphoma model EG7. M-HIFU ablation alone, but much less so T-HIFU, significantly  increased dendritic cell (DC) activation in draining lymph nodes (LNs).  Administration of CpG following T- or M-HIFU ablation increased DC activation in  draining LNs to a similar extend. Interestingly, ex vivo co-cultures of draining  LN suspensions from HIFU plus CpG treated mice with CD8(+) OT-I T cells  demonstrate that LN cells from M-HIFU treated mice most potently induced OT-I  proliferation. To delineate the mechanism for the enhanced anti-tumor immune  response induced by M-HIFU, we characterized the RNA, DNA and protein content of  tumor debris generated by both HIFU methods. M-HIFU induced a uniquely altered  RNA, DNA and protein profile, all showing clear signs of fragmentation, whereas  T-HIFU did not. Moreover, western blot analysis showed decreased levels of the  immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β in M-HIFU generated tumor debris  compared to untreated tumor tissue or T-HIFU. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these  results imply that M-HIFU induces a unique context of the ablated tumor material,  enhancing DC-mediated T cell responses when combined with CpG.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1038347","","","13","","Front Immunol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 van den Bijgaart, Mekers, Schuurmans, Raaijmakers, Wassink, Veltien, Dumont, Heerschap, Fütterer and Adema.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36569907  PMCID: PMC9768443","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Neoplasms; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Animals; Dendritic Cells; Lymphocyte Activation; Mice; TLR9 agonist CpG; cancer immunotherapy; dendritic cells; high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU); tumor antigens","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Outcomes per the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST), including  postural tremor scores (CRST Part A), combined hand tremor/motor scores (CRST  Parts A and B), and functional disability scores (CRST Part C), were measured by  a qualified neurologist. The Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire  (QUEST) was used to assess quality of life. CRST and QUEST scores at 48 and 60  months post-MRgFUS were compared to those at baseline to assess treatment  efficacy and durability. All adverse events (AEs) were reported. RESULTS:  Forty-five and 40 patients completed the 4- and 5-year follow-ups, respectively.  CRST scores for postural tremor (Part A) for the treated hand remained  significantly improved by 73.3% and 73.1% from baseline at both 48 and 60 months  posttreatment, respectively (both p < 0.0001). Combined hand tremor/motor scores  (Parts A and B) also improved by 49.5% and 40.4% (p < 0.0001) at each respective  time point. Functional disability scores (Part C) increased slightly over time  but remained significantly improved through the 5 years (p < 0.0001). Similarly,  QUEST scores remained significantly improved from baseline at year 4 (p < 0.0001)  and year 5 (p < 0.0003).

English abstracts relevant to the topic were selected. Full-text  articles were carefully analyzed. RESULTS: Uterine artery embolization is a  proven, widely accepted method that is effective in appropriately qualified  cases. Although high focused ultrasound is still an experimental procedure,  preliminary studies seem to be promising.

It is necessary to  explore new effective treatment methods to reduce the impact of TBI on  individuals and society. As an emerging neuromodulation technique, ultrasound is  used to treat some neurological diseases, but the neuroprotective mechanism of  low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFUS) in TBI remains unclear. We aimed to  investigate the protective effects and potential mechanisms of LIFUS in TBI.  METHODS: A rat model of TBI was established using the free-fall method. After  establishing the TBI model, the hypothalamus region was covered with LIFUS  radiation, and an orexin receptor 1 (OXR1) antagonist (SB334867) was injected  intraperitoneally. Neurobehavioral examination, Nissl staining, hematoxylin and  eosin staining of the brain tissue, and brain water content, were performed 3  days later. Western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction,  immunofluorescence staining, and immunohistochemical staining, were used to  evaluate the neuroprotective mechanisms of LIFUS. RESULTS: LIFUS improved tissue  damage, neurological deficits, and brain edema. LIFUS can increase the expression  of orexin-A (OX-A) and OXR1, significantly inhibit the activation of nuclear  factor-κB (NF-κB) protein and nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 3  (NLRP3) inflammasome after TBI, and reduce the release of pro-inflammatory  factors after TBI; however, SB334867 can reverse this effect. CONCLUSIONS: This  study suggests that LIFUS may play a neuroprotective role by promoting the  release of OX-A from the hypothalamus and inhibiting the inflammatory response  after TBI through the OX-A /NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway.","2022-09-16","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","7455-7469","","18","14","","Aging (Albany NY)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36126193  PMCID: PMC9550253","","","","*Brain Injuries, Traumatic/metabolism/therapy; *NF-kappa B/metabolism; Animals; Eosine Yellowish-(YS)/pharmacology; Hematoxylin/pharmacology; Humans; Inflammasomes/metabolism; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/metabolism; Nucleotides; Orexin Receptors; Orexins/pharmacology; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Signal Transduction; Water; low-intensity focused ultrasound; orexin-A/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway; traumatic brain injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we  conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pregnancy  outcomes of HIFU groups versus UAE groups with CSP. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed,  EMBASE, Cochrane, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases  were systematically searched to find studies that compared the therapeutic  effects of HIFU groups versus UAE groups. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Our primary  end points were blood loss, adverse events, success rate, and repregnancy. We  implemented random-effects models or fixed-effects models to evaluate the pooled  data. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Thirty-four eligible items were  included in studies. The blood loss was significantly reduced in HIFU groups  compared with UAE groups (standardized mean difference = -1.45, 95% confidence  interval [CI], 2.21 to -0.68; p <.001). Significantly fewer adverse events  occurred in the HIFU groups than in UAE groups (odds ratio [OR] = 0.36, 95% CI,  0.23-0.57; p <.001). The success rate of HIFU groups was higher than that of UAE  groups (OR = 1.56, 95% CI, 1.05-2.32; p = .03). There were more pregnancies in  HIFU groups than in UAE groups (OR = 1.64, 95% CI, 1.28-2.11; p <.001).

Benefits of implanted electrostimulatory  devices are still largely palliative, and many patients are not eligible to  receive them. A new form of neuromodulation, low intensity focused ultrasound  (LIFUS), is rapidly emerging, and has many potential intracranial applications.  LIFUS can noninvasively target tissue with a spatial distribution of highly  focused acoustic energy that ensures a therapeutic effect only at the geometric  focus of the transducer. A growing literature over the past several decades  supports the safety of LIFUS and its ability to noninvasively modulate neural  tissue in animals and humans by positioning the beam over various brain regions  to target motor, sensory, and visual cortices as well as frontal eye fields and  even hippocampus. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated the ability of  LIFUS to suppress seizures in epilepsy animal models without damaging tissue.  Resection after sonication to the antero-mesial lobe showed no pathologic changes  in epilepsy patients, and this is currently being trialed in serial treatments to  the hippocampus in DRE. Low intensity focused ultrasound is a promising, novel,  incisionless, and radiation-free alternative form of neuromodulation being  investigated for epilepsy. If proven safe and effective, it could be used to  target lateral cortex as well as deep structures without causing damage, and is  being studied extensively to treat a wide variety of neurologic and psychiatric  disorders including epilepsy.","2022-06","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","156-160","","3","22","","Epilepsy Curr","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2022.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36474831  PMCID: PMC9684587","","","","drug-resistant epilepsy; focused; low intensity focused ultrasound; neuromodulation; novel treatments; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Radical, whole-gland  therapies, such as prostatectomy or radiotherapy, are definitive treatments for  PCa, but they are associated with significant morbidity, including erectile  dysfunction and urinary incontinence. Focal therapies for PCa, whereby the part  of gland harboring disease is selectively treated, spares the normal surrounding  structures, and minimizes the morbidity associated with whole gland treatment.  The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance provides advantages over  ultrasound guidance, such as better localization and targeting of clinically  significant PCa (csPCa), as well as MRI thermometry which optimizes tissue  ablation temperatures. This review will discuss two MRI-guided high-intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU) techniques - transrectal MR-guided focused ultrasound  (MRgFUS) and TULSA (transurethral ultrasound ablation) ablation for localized  PCa. Overall, recent major trials for MRgFUS and TULSA have shown promising  oncological and functional results in the treatment of low- to intermediate-risk  PCa. Recent Phase II MRgFUS trials have shown better oncologic outcomes than the  published results for focal ultrasound guided HIFU and may justify the additional  costs associated with MRI guidance. While initial studies on TULSA have focused  on subtotal gland ablation, recent trials assessing oncological outcomes for  focal treatment of angular sectors have shown promise.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1069518","","","12","","Front Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Alabousi and Ghai.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36686753  PMCID: PMC9846805","","","","Focal Therapy; HIFU; MRI; MRI-guided intervention; Prostate MRI; prostate ablation; prostate cancer; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We  aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of micro-focused ultrasound (MFU)  therapy performed twice in the vaginal canal in a patients with VL and GSM. A  total of 20 women with GSM and VL were treated with MFU Ultravera by Hironic. The  treatment course consisted of two vaginal applications of MFU at an interval of 6  weeks. The clinical effects of the protocol were evaluated using the Vaginal  Laxity Questionnaire (VLQ), the Vaginal Health Index (VHI), and the Female Sexual  Function Index (FSFI). The overall values of the vaginal laxity evaluation for  the total subject population showed a statistically significant improvement  between the baseline and the findings at 3 and 6 months after treatment. The  effect of therapy was consistent across all domains of FSFI. It peaked at the 6  week follow-up visit (from 26.5 to 32) and plateaued at 12 weeks and 6 months.  There was a significant VHI improvement over time, with the greatest and most  significant change between the study entry and 21 days after treatment; the VHI  score leveled off up to 3 months after the procedures. MFU therapy, performed  twice in the vaginal canal, showed promising efficacy and safety profiles,  meriting further investigation.","2022-11-26","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","23","11","","J Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36498554  PMCID: PMC9739894","","","","aesthetic gynecology; genitourinary syndromes of menopause; micro-focused ultrasound (MFU); micro-focused ultrasound therapy; urogenital atrophy; vaginal laxity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An incisionless  therapy, it is becoming increasingly common worldwide. However, given MRgFUS'  relative novelty, there remain limited data on its benefits and adverse effects.  AREAS COVERED: We review the current state of evidence of MRgFUS for tremor,  highlight its challenges, and discuss future perspectives. EXPERT OPINION:  Essential tremor (ET) has been the major indication for MRgFUS since a milestone  randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 2016, with substantial evidence attesting to  the efficacy and acceptable safety profile of this treatment. Patients with other  tremor etiologies are also being treated with MRgFUS, with studies - including an  RCT - suggesting parkinsonian tremor in particular responds well to this  intervention. Additionally, targets other than the ventral intermediate nucleus,  such as the subthalamic nucleus and internal segment of the globus pallidus, have  been reported to improve parkinsonian symptoms beyond tremor, including rigidity  and bradykinesia. Although MRgFUS is encumbered by certain unique technical  challenges, it nevertheless offers significant advantages compared to alternative  neurosurgical interventions for tremor. The fast-growing interest in this  treatment modality will likely lead to further scientific and technological  advancements that could optimize and expand its therapeutic potential.","2022-10","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","849-861","","10","22","","Expert Rev Neurother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36469578","","","","*Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Basal ganglia; Humans; Parkinson’s disease; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; essential tremor; magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound; pallidotomy; subthalamotomy; thalamotomy; ventral intermediate nucleus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, the piezoelectric material (Pz12X) is evaluated from the  standpoint of transducer design and its important characteristics, including  temperature dependance of several parameters such as dielectric and mechanical  coefficients. Then, the performance of six transducers of the same design is  evaluated in terms of electro-acoustic efficiency and its dependency on the  operating acoustic power level up to 30 W. Overall, the initial electro-acoustic  efficiency of three independent transducers is approximately 50% at low acoustic  power levels and slightly drops down to 42% as the input electric power reaches  10 W. This process is stable and fully reversible. Moreover, the stability of  electro-acoustic efficiency over extended power burst cycling is studied using  another two transducers up to 95 × 10(3) power bursts of 250-ms duration and  acoustic power of 10 W. This protocol is beyond the typical clinical use of  similar devices in practice. No significant changes in electro-acoustic  performance are noted. Additionally, the input electric power and the output  acoustic power, together with the temperature of the piezoelectric component, are  evaluated simultaneously over the period of one power burst. It is found that the  maximum operating temperature over a high-input electric power burst of 600 J is  below 60°C, which defines the operational limit for such devices, as the  de-poling temperature of the lead-free material is around 85°C. It is found that  the lead-free material from the NBT family is also a promising alternative to  lead-based PZT-type materials in high-power therapeutic ultrasound.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2530-2543","","12","48","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Several other energy-based  devices are in use in countries outside the USA where they are marketed for  indications similar to those of MFU-V, although published studies supporting  these indications are limited and none of the other devices provides  visualization or verification they reach the superficial musculoaponeurotic  system. METHODS: Due to the evolving landscape of ultrasound technology as more  devices enter the market, seven global thought leaders who are qualified experts  on the use of various high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)/MFU-V technologies  convened to review data from an independent evaluation of the software, thermal  characteristics, transducer acoustics and ultrasound therapy of MFU-V and three  other ultrasound-based devices. RESULTS: The independent testing demonstrated the  devices have key differences in several parameters that play a role in safety and  effectiveness. Specifically, MFU-V has visualization capability but the other  devices lack that feature. Other differences include the retention of patient  history, consistent size and uniformity of thermal coagulation points (TCPs),  precise localization of energy concentration at the focal point, and reliable  thermal regulation during use. The expert panel established a consensus on the  types of preventable complications associated with ultrasound-based energy  devices and techniques for preventing and treating complications. CONCLUSIONS:  The independent test results of MFU-V/HIFU devices and the consensus panel  conclusions provide strong support that real-time visualization and the  capability to detect coupling, features found only in MFU-V, help prevent  complications and enhance the safety and effectiveness of energy-based devices.  The independent evaluation also revealed that MFU-V has several additional  features that play key roles in safety and clinical effectiveness, including  uniformity of TCPs, tight thermal regulation, large focal gain, and short beam  length, that were not found collectively in any of the HIFU devices.","2022-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","636-647","","2","21","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 The Authors.
