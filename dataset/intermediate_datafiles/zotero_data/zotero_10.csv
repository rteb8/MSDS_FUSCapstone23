Treatment of cancer is complex and  challenging and therefore often multifaceted, as in the case of osteosarcoma (OS)  and soft tissue sarcoma (STS). OS predominantly involves the appendicular  skeleton and STS commonly develops in the extremities, resulting in treatment  challenges due to the need to balance wide-margin resections to achieve local  oncological control against the functional outcomes for the patient. To achieve  wide tumor resection, invasive limb salvage surgery is often required, and the  patient is at risk for numerous complications which can ultimately lead to  impaired limb function and mobility. The advent of tumor ablation techniques  offers the exciting potential of developing noninvasive or minimally invasive  treatment options for extremity tumors. One promising innovative tumor ablation  technique with strong potential to serve as a noninvasive limb salvage treatment  for extremity tumor patients is histotripsy. Histotripsy is a novel, noninvasive,  non-thermal, and non-ionizing focused ultrasound technique which uses controlled  acoustic cavitation to mechanically disintegrate tissue with high precision. In  this review, we present the ongoing development of histotripsy as a non-surgical  alternative for extremity tumors and highlight the value of spontaneously  occurring OS and STS in the pet dog as a comparative oncology research model to  advance this field of histotripsy research.","2023","2024-03-18 17:30:18","2024-03-18T17:30:18Z","","2274802","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37994796  PMCID: PMC10669778","","","","*Ablation Techniques/methods; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Sarcoma/pathology; Animals; Dogs; Extremities/pathology; Histotripsy; Humans; canine comparative oncology model; extremity tumors; osteosarcoma; soft tissue sarcoma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

None of these are cancer-specific and are  commonly accompanied by side effects, including urinary incontinence and erectile  dysfunction. Moreover, subsequent surgical treatments following biochemical  recurrence after these interventions are either limited or affected by the  scarring present in the surrounding tissue. Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a  histidine-containing naturally occurring dipeptide which has been shown to have  an anti-tumorigenic role without any detrimental effect on healthy cells;  however, its effect on prostate cancer cells has never been investigated. In this  study, we investigated the effect of carnosine on cell proliferation and  metabolism in both a primary cultured androgen-resistant human prostate cancer  cell line, PC346Flu1 and murine TRAMP-C1 cells. Our results show that carnosine  has a significant dose-dependent inhibitory effect in vitro on the proliferation  of both human (PC346Flu1) and murine (TRAMP-C1) prostate cancer cells, which was  confirmed in 3D-models of the same cells. Carnosine was also shown to decrease  adenosine triphosphate content and reactive species which might have been caused  in part by the increase in SIRT3 also shown after carnosine treatment. These  encouraging results support the need for further human in vivo work to determine  the potential use of carnosine, either alone or, most likely, as an adjunct  therapy to surgical or other conventional treatments.","2024-01","2024-03-06 17:02:19","2024-03-06T17:02:19Z","","e18061","","2","28","","J Cell Mol Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

The aim of the study was to develop  an in vitro model to observe how the effects of sonothrombolysis change in the  case where a tissue-mimicking material (TMM) is placed in the path of the US beam  before the clot. METHODS: Fully retracted blood clots were prepared and pulse  sonicated for 1 h under various conditions. The system was in a state of real  circulating flow with a branch of an open bypass and an occluded tube containing  a blood clot, thus mimicking the case of ischemic stroke. The effectiveness of  thrombolysis was quantified in milligrams of clots removed. An agar-based TMM was  developed around the occluded tube. RESULTS: The clot breakdown in a TMM was  found to be more pronounced than in water, presumably due to the retention of the  acoustic field. A higher level of acoustic power was required to initiate clot  lysis (>76 W acoustic power) using only focused US (FUS). The greatest  thrombolysis enhancement was observed with the largest chosen pulse duration (PD)  and the use of MBs (150 mg clot mass lysis). The synergistic effect of FUS in  combination with MBs on the enzymatic fibrinolysis enhanced thrombolysis efficacy  by 260% compared to thrombolysis induced using only FUS. A reduction in the  degree of clot lysis was detected due to the attenuation factor of the  intervening material (30 mg at 1 and 4 ms PD). CONCLUSION: In vitro thrombolytic  models including a TMM can provide a more realistic evaluation of new  thrombolytic protocols. However, higher acoustic power should be considered to  compensate for the attenuation factor. The rate of clot lysis is slow and the  clinical use of this method will be challenging.","2023-09","2024-03-06 17:02:13","2024-03-06T17:02:13Z","","211-217","","3","31","","J Med Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright: © 2022 Journal of Medical Ultrasound.","","","","","","Place: India PMID: 38025011  PMCID: PMC10668898","","","","Focused ultrasound; microbubbles; stroke; thrombolytic agent; tissue-mimicking material","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PURPOSE: To devise and investigate a  deployable applicator suitable for minimally-invasive delivery of therapeutic  ultrasound, consisting of a 2D cylindrical sectored-ring ultrasound phased array,  integrated within an expandable paraboloid-shaped balloon-based reflector. The  balloon can be collapsed for compact delivery and expanded close to the target  position to mimic a larger-diameter concentric-ring sector-vortex array for  enhanced dynamic control of focal depth and volume. METHODS: Acoustic and  biothermal simulations were employed in 3D generalized homogeneous and  patient-specific heterogeneous models, for three-phased array transducers with  32, 64, and 128 elements, composed of sectored 4, 8, and 16 tubular ring  transducers, respectively. The applicator performance was characterized as a  function of array configuration, focal depth, phasing modes, and balloon  reflector geometry. A 16-element proof-of-concept phased array applicator  assembly, consisting of four tubular transducers each divided into four sectors,  was fabricated, and characterized with hydrophone measurements along and across  the axis, and ablations in ex vivo tissue. RESULTS: Simulation results indicated  that transducer arrays (1.5 MHz, 9 mm OD × 20 mm long), balloon sizes (41-50 mm  expanded diameter, 20-60 mm focal depth), phasing mode (0-4) and sonication  duration (30 s) can produce spatially localized acoustic intensity focal patterns  (focal length: 3-22 mm, focal width: 0.7-8.7 mm) and ablative thermal lesions  (width: 2.7-16 mm, length: 6-46 mm) in pancreatic tissue across a 10-90 mm focal  depth range. Patient-specific studies indicated that 0.1, 0.46, and 1.2 cm(3)  volume of tumor can be ablated in the body of the pancreas for 120 s sonications  using a single axial focus (Mode 0), or four, and eight simultaneous foci in a  toroidal pattern (Mode 2 and 4, respectively). Hydrophone measurements  demonstrated good agreement with simulation. Experiments in which chicken meat  was thermally ablated indicated that volumetric ablation can be produced using  single or multiple foci. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated the  feasibility of a novel compact ultrasound applicator design capable of focusing,  deep penetration, electronic steering, and volumetric thermal ablation. The  proposed applicator can be used for compact endoluminal or laparoscopic delivery  of localized ultrasound energy to deep-seated targets.","2023-01","2024-03-06 17:02:11","2024-03-06T17:02:11Z","","1-19","","1","50","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

OBJECTIVES: This scoping review aimed to describe the current state of knowledge  about the diagnosis and treatment of XDP, to provide clinicians with a concise  and up-to-date overview. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of pertinent  literature on the diagnosis and treatment of XDP using Preferred Reporting Items  for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews  guidelines. RESULTS: There were 24 articles on diagnostic methods and 20 articles  on therapeutic interventions for XDP, with 7 review articles describing both. The  detection of the SVA retrotransposon insertion within the TAF1 gene is  confirmatory for XDP. Oral medications are marginally effective. Chemodenervation  with botulinum toxin is an effective treatment. Pallidal deep brain stimulation  (DBS) has been shown to provide significant improvement in the dystonia and  quality of life of patients with XDP for a longer time. A less invasive surgical  option is the transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound  (tcMRgFUS), which has shown promising effects with the limited number of case  reports available. CONCLUSION: XDP is a geneti disorder characterized by striatal  symptoms and pathology on neuroimaging. No effective oral medications are  available for the management of XDP. The use of botulinum toxin is limited by its  cost and duration of effects. As of now, pallidal DBS is deemed to be the best  option. Another promising option is the tcMRgFUS but still has limited studies on  its safety and efficacy in XDP.","2024-02","2024-03-06 17:01:37","2024-03-06T17:01:37Z","","105949","","","119","","Parkinsonism Relat Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the pain perception during the  MFU-V procedure between two pain reduction methods (topical anesthesia alone  versus combined topical anesthesia with forced air cooling). MATERIALS AND  METHODS: This was a prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. A  square area on the inner side of both arms of healthy volunteers was marked as an  experimental site and randomly assigned to receive each pain reduction method:  topical anesthesia or combined topical anesthesia with forced air cooling.  Thereafter, MFU-V was performed with a 4.5 MHz, 4.5 mm transducer (10 lines,  0.9 J) followed by a 7 MHz, 3.0 mm transducer (10 lines, 0.3 J). The visual  analog scale (VAS) for pain was measured immediately after 4.5 mm transducer  (T1a), immediately after 3.0 mm transducer (T1b), and after the entire procedure  (T2). RESULTS: Twenty-one participants with a mean (SD) age of 34.67 (±6.18)  years were enrolled. The mean (±SD) pain score of combined topical anesthesia  with forced air cooling-treated area was 5.40 (±1.64), 4.80 (±1.63), and 5.40  (±1.56) at T1a, T1b, and T2, respectively. The mean pain score for topical  anesthesia-treated areas was 5.89 (±1.45), 5.00 (±1.72), and 5.76 (±1.67) at T1a,  T1b, and T2, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in  the pain perception between the two methods. CONCLUSION: The addition of forced  air cooling is not beneficial for pain reduction during the MFU-V procedure  because its temperature reduction effect cannot be delivered to the deep parts of  the skin, which is the target site of MFU-V.","2023-04","2024-03-06 17:01:00","2024-03-06T17:01:00Z","","1279-1285","","4","22","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

We have developed a fibrin-based smart hydrogel, termed an acoustically  responsive scaffold (ARS), which responds to focused ultrasound in a  spatiotemporally controlled, user-defined manner. ARSs are highly flexible  platforms due to the inclusion of phase-shift droplets and their tunable response  to ultrasound through a mechanism termed acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV).  Here, we demonstrated that ADV enabled consistent generation of micropores in  ARSs, throughout the entire thickness (∼5.5 mm), utilizing perfluorooctane  phase-shift droplets. Size characteristics of the generated micropores were  quantified in response to critical parameters including acoustic properties,  droplet size, and shear elastic modulus of fibrin using confocal microscopy. The  findings showed that the length of the generated micropores correlated directly  with excitation frequency, peak rarefactional pressure, pulse duration, droplet  size, and indirectly with the shear elastic modulus of the fibrin matrix. The  ADV-generated micropores in ARSs were further compared with cavitation-mediated  micropores in fibrin gels without droplets. Additionally, the Keller-Miksis  equation was used to predict an upper bound for micropore formation in ARSs at  varying driving frequencies and droplet sizes. Finally, our in vivo studies  showed that host cell migration following ADV-induced micropore formation was  frequency-dependent, with up to 2.6 times higher cell migration at lower  frequencies. Overall, these findings demonstrate a new potential application of  ADV in hydrogels. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Interconnected micropores within a  hydrogel can facilitate many cell-mediated processes. Most techniques for  generating micropores are typically not biocompatible or do not enable  controlled, in situ micropore formation. We used an ultrasound-based technique,  termed acoustic droplet vaporization, to generate microporosity in smart  hydrogels termed acoustically responsive scaffolds (ARSs). ARSs contain a fibrin  matrix doped with a phase-shift droplet. We demonstrate that unique acoustic  properties of phase-shift droplets can be tailored to yield spatiotemporally  controlled, on-demand micropore formation. Additionally, the size characteristics  of the ultrasound-generated micropores can be modulated by tuning ultrasound  parameters, droplet properties, and bulk elastic properties of fibrin. Finally,  we demonstrate significant, frequency-dependent host cell migration in  subcutaneously implanted ARSs in mice following ultrasound-induced micropore  formation in situ.","2023-07-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","195-208","","","164","","Acta Biomater","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Acta Materialia Inc.

Multiple studies have proved its effectiveness in the  treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)  and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) are non-invasive and safe  physical therapy methods for KOA. This study is the first to propose the  treatment of KOA with physical stimulation after PRP treatment, and to observe  the clinical efficacy of the treatment method. METHODS: This is a protocol paper  that outlines a randomized controlled trial, patients will be assigned randomly  to the PRP group, PRP+LIFU group, PRP+TENS group, and PRP+LIFU combined TENS  group. The patients will be followed at 12-week and 24-week time points to  evaluate the primary and secondary outcomes of the study. The primary outcome is  the VAS pain score. Secondary outcomes include Western Ontario and McMaster  Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and International Knee Documentation  Committee scores (IKDC). After baseline examination, all patients will sign a  written informed consent for study participation after a full explanation of the  treatment protocol.

Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances on the inner walls of arteries. It can affect arteries of heart,  brain, arms, legs, pelvis and kidney, resulting in ischemic heart disease,  carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease and chronic kidney disease.  Laser-based treatment techniques like laser atherectomy can be used to treat many  common atherosclerostic diseases. However, the use of laser-based treatment  remains limited due to the high risk of complications and low efficiency in  removing atherosclerostic plaques as compared with other treatment methods. In  this study, we developed a technology that used high intensity focused ultrasound  to assist laser treatment in the removal of the lipid core of atherosclerotic  plaques.Approach. The fundamental mechanism to disrupt atherosclerostic plaque  was to enhance the mechanical effect of cavitation during laser/ultrasound  therapy. To promote cavitation, spatiotemporally synchronized ultrasound bursts  of 2% duty cycle at 0.5 MHz and nanosecond laser pulses at 532 nm wavelength were  used. Experiments were first performed on pig belly fat samples to titrate  ultrasound and laser parameters. Then, experiments were conducted on human plaque  samples, where the lipid depositions of the plaques were targeted.Main results.  Our results showed that fat tissue could be removed with an ultrasound peak  negative pressure (PNP) of 2.45 MPa and a laser radiant exposure as low as 3.2 mJ  mm(-2). The lipid depositions on the atherosclerostic plaques were removed with  laser radiant exposure of 16 mJ mm(-2)in synchronizing with an ultrasound PNP of  5.4 MPa. During all the experiments, laser-only and ultrasound-only control  treatments at the same energy levels were not effective in removing the  lipid.Significance. The results demonstrated that the addition of ultrasound  could effectively reduce the needed laser power for atherosclerotic plaque  removal, which will potentially improve treatment safety and efficiency of  current laser therapies.","2023-02-21","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","5","68","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36804803","","","","*Laser Therapy; *Plaque, Atherosclerotic/diagnostic imaging; Animals; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Lasers; Lipids; Swine; atherosclerosis; cavitation; excimer laser coronary angioplasty; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To review and  compare the effectiveness of all current ablative and non-surgical therapies for  patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (≤ 3 cm). DESIGN: Systematic review  and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Nine databases (March 2021), two trial  registries (April 2021) and reference lists of relevant systematic reviews.  REVIEW METHODS: Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of ablative  and non-surgical therapies, versus any comparator, for small hepatocellular  carcinoma. Randomised controlled trials were quality assessed using the Cochrane  Risk of Bias 2 tool and mapped. The comparative effectiveness of therapies was  assessed using network meta-analysis. A threshold analysis was used to identify  which comparisons were sensitive to potential changes in the evidence. Where  comparisons based on randomised controlled trial evidence were not robust or no  randomised controlled trials were identified, a targeted systematic review of  non-randomised, prospective comparative studies provided additional data for  repeat network meta-analysis and threshold analysis. The feasibility of  undertaking economic modelling was explored. A workshop with patients and  clinicians was held to discuss the findings and identify key priorities for  future research. RESULTS: Thirty-seven randomised controlled trials (with over  3700 relevant patients) were included in the review. The majority were conducted  in China or Japan and most had a high risk of bias or some risk of bias concerns.  The results of the network meta-analysis were uncertain for most comparisons.  There was evidence that percutaneous ethanol injection is inferior to  radiofrequency ablation for overall survival (hazard ratio 1.45, 95% credible  interval 1.16 to 1.82), progression-free survival (hazard ratio 1.36, 95%  credible interval 1.11 to 1.67), overall recurrence (relative risk 1.19, 95%  credible interval 1.02 to 1.39) and local recurrence (relative risk 1.80, 95%  credible interval 1.19 to 2.71). Percutaneous acid injection was also inferior to  radiofrequency ablation for progression-free survival (hazard ratio 1.63, 95%  credible interval 1.05 to 2.51). Threshold analysis showed that further evidence  could plausibly change the result for some comparisons. Fourteen eligible  non-randomised studies were identified (n ≥ 2316); twelve had a high risk of bias  so were not included in updated network meta-analyses. Additional non-randomised  data, made available by a clinical advisor, were also included (n = 303). There  remained a high level of uncertainty in treatment rankings after the network  meta-analyses were updated. However, the updated analyses suggested that  microwave ablation and resection are superior to percutaneous ethanol injection  and percutaneous acid injection for some outcomes. Further research on  stereotactic ablative radiotherapy was recommended at the workshop, although it  is only appropriate for certain patient subgroups, limiting opportunities for  adequately powered trials. LIMITATIONS: Many studies were small and of poor  quality. No comparative studies were found for some therapies. CONCLUSIONS: The  existing evidence base has limitations; the uptake of specific ablative therapies  in the United Kingdom appears to be based more on technological advancements and  ease of use than strong evidence of clinical effectiveness. However, there is  evidence that percutaneous ethanol injection and percutaneous acid injection are  inferior to radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation and resection.

In this study, passive cavitation imaging/mapping  (PCI/PAM), which is used to map cavitation sources based on the correlation of  signals across an array of receivers, is evaluated. Traditional reconstruction  techniques in PCI, such as delay-and-sum, yield high spatial resolution at the  cost of a substantial computational time. This results from the  resource-intensive process of determining sensor weights for individual pixels in  these methodologies. Consequently, the use of conventional algorithms for image  reconstruction does not meet the speed requirements that are essential for  real-time monitoring. Here, we show that a three-dimensional (3D) convolutional  network can learn the image reconstruction algorithm for a 16×16 element matrix  probe with a receive frequency ranging from 256 kHz up to 1.0 MHz. The network  was trained and evaluated using simulated data representing point sources,  resulting in the successful reconstruction of volumetric images with high  sensitivity, especially for single isolated sources (100% in the test set). As  the number of simultaneous sources increased, the network's ability to detect  weaker intensity sources diminished, although it always correctly identified the  main lobe. Notably, however, network inference was remarkably fast, completing  the task in approximately 178 s for a dataset comprising 650 frames of 413 volume  images with signal duration of 20μs. This processing speed is roughly thirty  times faster than a parallelized implementation of the traditional time exposure  acoustics algorithm on the same GPU device. This would open a new door for PCI  application in the real-time monitoring of ultrasound ablation.","2023-10-27","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","21","23","","Sensors (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37960460  PMCID: PMC10650508","","","","*Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Algorithms; Diagnostic Imaging; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Neural Networks, Computer; Ultrasonography/methods; beamforming; convolutional neural network; deep learning; focused ultrasound; passive cavitation imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

B, Biointerfaces","","1873-4367 0927-7765","10.1016/j.colsurfb.2023.113468","","Thrombus is one of the culprits for global health problems. However, most current antithrombotic drugs are limited by restricted targeting ability and a high risk  of systemic bleeding. A hybrid cell membrane-coated biomimetic nanosystem  (PM/RM@PLGA@P/R) was constructed in this paper to fulfil the targeted delivery of  ginsenoside (Rg1) and perfluorohexane (PFH). Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)  is used as carriers to coat Rg1 and PFH. Thanks to the camouflage of erythrocyte  membrane (RM) and platelet membrane (PM), the nanosystem in question possesses  remarkable features including immune escape and self-targeting. Therefore, a  compact nano-core with PLGA@P/R was formed, with a hybrid membrane covering the  surface of the core, forming a ""core-shell"" structure. With its ""core-shell""  structure, this nanoparticle fancifully combines the advantages of both PFH (the  low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)-responsive phase-change thrombolysis) and  Rg1(the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant abilities). Meanwhile,  PM/RM@PLGA@P/R nanoparticles exhibits superior in-vitro performance in terms of  ROS scavenging, anticoagulant activity and immune escape compared with those  without cell membranes (PLGA@P/R). Furthermore, in the animal experiment in which  the tail vein thrombosis model was established by injecting k-carrageenan, the  combined treatment of LIFU and PM/RM@PLGA@P/R showed a satisfactory  antithrombotic efficiency (88.20 %) and a relatively higher biological safety  level. This strategy provides new insights into the development of more effective  and safer targeted biomimetic nanomedicines for antithrombotic treatments,  possessing potential application in synergistic therapy field.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","113468","","","229","","Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023.

Methods: A systematic search was performed (Pubmed,  Embase) to assess the efficacy of single MFU treatments for facial skin  tightening. Eligible studies included randomised controlled trials, controlled  trials, cohort studies and case series (n ≥ 10). Objective and subjective  outcomes were assessed. Results: A total of 693 studies were identified of which  16 studies were eligible. All the studies involved female patients. MFU is  capable of tightening the skin, as observed in studies measuring the results of  brow lifts (0.47−1.7 mm) and submental lifts (measured as a 26−45 mm2 reduction  in the submental area on lateral photographs). Data from the Global Aesthetic  Improvement Scale (GAIS) were pooled, and the day 90 pooled subjective  investigator reported scores (IGAIS) (n = 337) showed that 92% of the patients  demonstrated an improvement in skin tightening and/or in wrinkle reduction which  continued up to one year. Longer-term follow-up data are not available. The  patient-reported pooled scores (SGAIS) (n = 81) showed that the skin improvements  were mild and continued to increase from 42% (90 days) to 53% (360 days)  post-treatment. The MFU treatment was moderately painful and caused transient  erythema with or without oedema. Other adverse effects were rare (2%), including  dysesthesia (numbness or hypersensitivity), bruising and stinging, mandibular  burns, striations and contact dermatitis. Various device settings, treatment  protocols and energies were applied. Excessive skin laxity and a BMI > 30 were  posed as relative contraindications for MFU treatment because positive results  declined with an increase in laxity and BMI. Conclusions: MFU treatment is  effective in tightening female patients’ mildly to moderately lax facial skin.  Future studies should focus on objective treatment outcomes, optimising treatment  regimens and male patients.","2023-01-13","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","2","20","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36674277  PMCID: PMC9861614","","","","*Cosmetic Techniques/adverse effects; *Rhytidoplasty/adverse effects/methods; *Skin Aging; *Ultrasonic Therapy/adverse effects/methods; Face; Female; HIFU; Humans; Male; Pain/etiology; Patient Satisfaction; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography; cosmetic; laxity; microfocused ultrasound; rejuvenation; skin; wrinkle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this study aims to develop a  power amplifier scheme to increase power efficiency while maintaining appropriate  echo signal quality. In communication systems, the Doherty power amplifier has  shown relatively good power efficiency while producing high signal distortion.  The same design scheme cannot be directly applied to ultrasound instrumentation.  Therefore, the Doherty power amplifier needs to be re-designed. To verify the  feasibility of the instrumentation, a Doherty power amplifier was designed to  obtain high power efficiency. The measured gain, output 1-dB compression point,  and power-added efficiency of the designed Doherty power amplifier were 33.71 dB,  35.71 dB(m), and 57.24% at 25 MHz, respectively. In addition, the performance of  the developed amplifier was measured and tested using the ultrasound transducer  through the pulse-echo responses. The output power with 25 MHz, 5-cycle, and  43.06 dB(m) generated from the Doherty power amplifier was sent through the  expander to the focused ultrasound transducer with 25 MHz and 0.5″ diameter. The  detected signal was sent via a limiter. Afterwards, the signal was amplified by a  36.8 dB gain preamplifier, and then displayed in the oscilloscope. The measured  peak-to-peak amplitude in the pulse-echo response with an ultrasound transducer  was 0.9698 V. The data showed a comparable echo signal amplitude. Therefore, the  designed Doherty power amplifier can improve the power efficiency used for  medical ultrasound instrumentation.","2023-02-21","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","5","23","","Sensors (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36904610  PMCID: PMC10007245","","","","Doherty power amplifier; ultrasound instrumentation; ultrasound transducer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Techniques such as quasi-static ultrasound elastography have been  developed to assess the strain distribution in soft tissues in two dimensions  using a quasi-static compression. However, as abnormalities can exhibit very  heterogeneous shapes, a three dimensional approach would be necessary to  accurately measure their volume and remove operator dependency. Acquisition of  volumes at high rates is also critical to performing real-time imaging with a  simple freehand compression. In this study, we developed for the first time a 3D  quasi-static ultrasound elastography method with plane waves that estimates axial  strain distribution in vivo in entire volumes at high volume rate. Acquisitions  were performed with a 2D matrix array probe of 2.5MHz frequency and 256 elements.  Plane waves were emitted at a volume rate of 100 volumes/s during a continuous  motorized and freehand compression. 3D B-mode volumes and 3D cumulative axial  strain volumes were successfully estimated in inclusion phantoms and in ex vivo  canine liver before and after a high intensity focused ultrasound ablation. We  also demonstrated the in vivo feasibility of the method using freehand  compression on the calf muscle of a human volunteer and were able to retrieve 3D  axial strain volume at a high volume rate depicting the differences in stiffness  of the two muscles which compose the calf muscle. 3D ultrasound quasi-static  elastography with plane waves could become an important technique for the imaging  of the elasticity in human bodies in three dimensions using simple freehand  scanning.","2023-04-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","ISSN: 2331-8422 Journal Abbreviation: ArXiv Publication Title: ArXiv PMID: 37090234  PMCID: PMC10120752","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline recommends the genotyping of  informative alterations as a routine clinical practice for central nervous system  (CNS) tumors, the acquisition of tumor tissue in the CNS is invasive and not  always possible. Liquid biopsy is a non-invasive approach that provides the  opportunity to capture the complex molecular heterogeneity of the whole tumor  through the detection of circulating tumor biomarkers in body fluids, such as  blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Despite all of the advantages, the low  abundance of tumor-derived biomarkers, particularly in CNS tumors, as well as  their short half-life has limited the application of liquid biopsy in clinical  practice. Thus, it is crucial to identify the factors associated with the  presence of these biomarkers and explore possible strategies that can increase  the shedding of these tumoral components into biological fluids. In this review,  we first describe the clinical applications of liquid biopsy in CNS tumors,  including its roles in the early detection of recurrence and monitoring of  treatment response. We then discuss the utilization of imaging in identifying the  factors that affect the detection of circulating biomarkers as well as how  image-guided interventions such as focused ultrasound can help enhance the  presence of tumor biomarkers through blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption.","2023-10-29","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","21","15","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37958372  PMCID: PMC10650848","","","","MRI; PET/MRI; brain tumor; cell-free DNA; circulating tumor DNA; imaging; liquid biopsy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, we evaluated the transduction efficiency and  safety of opening up to 105 sites simultaneously. Increasing the number of  targeted sites increased gene delivery efficiency at each site. We achieved  transduction of up to 60% of brain cells with comparable efficiency in the  majority of the brain regions. Furthermore, gene delivery with FUS-BBBO was safe  even when all 105 sites were targeted simultaneously without negative effects on  animal weight or neuronal loss.

Meeting these requirements needs a 2D array of  ultrasound transducers directly integrated with a high-frequency 2D phased-array  ASIC. However, this imposes severe challenges on the design of the ASIC. In order  to avoid the generation of grating lobes, the elements in the 2D phased-array  should have a pitch of half of the ultrasound wavelength, which, as frequency  increases, highly reduces the area available for the design of high-voltage  beamforming channels. This article addresses these challenges by presenting the  system-level optimization and implementation of a high-frequency 2D phased-array  ASIC. The system-level study focuses on the optimization of the US transmitter  toward high-frequency operation while minimizing power consumption. This study  resulted in the implementation of two ASICs in TSMC 180 nm BCD technology:  firstly, an individual beamforming channel was designed to demonstrate the  tradeoffs between frequency, driving voltage, and beamforming capabilities.  Finally, a 12-MHz pitch matched 12 × 12 phased-array ASIC working at 20-V  amplitude and 3-bit phasing was designed and experimentally validated, to  demonstrate high-frequency phased-array operation. The measurement results verify  the phasing functionality of the ASIC with a maximum DNL of 0.35 LSB.

Liver transplantation, surgical resection and ablation are  the three main curative treatments for HCC. Liver transplantation is the optimal  treatment option for HCC, but its usage is limited by the shortage of liver  sources. Surgical resection is considered the first choice for early-stage HCC,  but it does not apply to patients with poor liver function. Therefore, more and  more doctors choose ablation for HCC. However, intrahepatic recurrence occurs in  up to 70% patients within 5 years after initial treatment. For patients with  oligo recurrence after primary treatment, repeated resection and local ablation  are both alternative. Only 20% patients with recurrent HCC (rHCC) indicate  repeated surgical resection because of limitations in liver function, tumor  location and intraperitoneal adhesions. Local ablation has become an option for  the waiting period when liver transplantation is unavailable. For patients with  intrahepatic recurrence after liver transplantation, local ablation can reduce  the tumor burden and prepare them for liver transplantation. This review  systematically describes the various ablation treatments for rHCC, including  radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, laser ablation, high-intensity  focused ultrasound ablation, cryablation, irreversible electroporation,  percutaneous ethanol injection, and the combination of ablation and other  treatment modalities.","2023-04-27","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","515-524","","4","15","","World J Hepatol","","","","","","","","eng","©The Author(s) 2023.

They can be benign or malignant. Clinical signs depend primarily on the location of the tumor and its effect on  blood flow. CASE PRESENTATION: An eleven-year-old crossbreed male dog lethargic  and anorectic for previous 3 days was presented to the veterinary clinic. The  focused ultrasound assessment with sonograms in trauma (FAST) revealed multiple  tumors in the heart which were then confirmed in echocardiographic examination  performed by a veterinary cardiologist. Due to the poor general condition and  grave prognosis, the dog was humanely euthanized. The autopsy revealed numerous  intracardiac tumors in all four heart chambers. No proliferative changes were  found in other organs either in thoracic or abdominal cavity. Immunohistochemical  examination was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from  heart masses. The antibodies against myoglobin, desmin, smooth muscle actin,  vimentin, CD34, S100, and pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) were used. Microscopically,  the tumor was composed of fascicles of spindle-shaped cells with pale  eosinophilic cytoplasm with round, oval, and focally elongated nuclei and one or  two prominent nucleoli. The tumor cells showed strong diffuse cytoplasmic  immunopositivity for myoglobin and vimentin and focal staining for desmin.  Immunostainings for smooth muscle actin-SMA, CD34, pan-cytokeratin, S-100 protein  were negative. The immunohistochemical staining pattern confirmed  rhabdomyosarcoma.

When paired with acoustically  active particles such as microbubbles (MBs), it can open the blood brain barrier  (BBB) to facilitate drug delivery inhibited due to the presence of BBB. One of  the parameters that affects the FUS beam propagation is the beam incidence angle  on the skull. Prior work by our group has shown that, as incidence angles deviate  from 90°, FUS focal pressures attenuate and result to a smaller BBB opening  volume. The incidence angles calculated in our prior studies were in 2D and used  skull information from CT. The study presented herein develops methods to  calculate incidence angle in 3D in non-human primate (NHP) skull fragments using  harmonic ultrasound imaging without using ionizing radiation. Our results show  that ultrasound harmonic imaging is capable of accurately depicting features such  as sutures and eye-sockets of the skull. Furthermore, we were able to reproduce  previously reported relationships between the incidence angle and FUS beam  attenuation. We also show feasibility of performing ultrasound harmonic imaging  in in-vivo non-human primates. The all-ultrasound method presented herein  combined with our neuronavigation system stands to increase more widespread  adoption of FUS and render it accessible by eliminating the need for CT cranial  mapping.","2023-06-13","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Res Sq Pages: rs.3.rs-3017935 Publication Title: Research square PMID: 37397998  PMCID: PMC10312917","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, focused ultrasound (FUS) is mostly employed to  create microbubbles that induce a cavitation effect to open the BBB. However,  microbubbles pass quickly through brain microvessels, substantially limiting the  cavitation effect. Here, we constructed a novel perfluoropropane-loaded  microbubble, termed ApoER-Pep-MB, which possessed a siloxane bonds-crosslinked  surface to increase the microbubble stability against turbulence in blood  circulation and was decorated with binding peptide for apolipoprotein E receptor  (ApoER-Pep). The microbubble with tailor-made micron size (2 µm) and negative  surface charge (-30 mV) performed ApoER-mediated binding rather than  internalization into brain capillary endothelial cells. Consequently, the  microbubble accumulated on the brain microvessels, based on which even a  low-energy ultrasound with less safety risk than FUS, herein diagnostic  ultrasound (DUS), could create a strong cavitation effect to open the BBB. Evans  Blue and immunofluorescence staining studies demonstrated that the DUS-triggered  cavitation effect not only temporarily opened the BBB for 2 h but also caused  negligible damage to the brain tissue. Therefore, various agents, ranging from  small molecules to nanoscale objects, can be efficiently delivered to target  regions of the brain, offering tremendous opportunities for the treatment of  brain diseases.","2023-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e2302134","","33","10","","Adv Sci (Weinh)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

SUMMARY: While these lesions were previously thought to behave  similarly to adult HGG, emerging data have demonstrated that DIPG is a  biologically distinct entity from adult HGG frequently driven by mutations in the  histone genes H3.3 and H3.1 not found in adult glioma. While biopsy of DIPG was  historically felt to confer unacceptable risk of morbidity and mortality,  multiple studies have demonstrated that stereotactic biopsy of DIPG is safe,  allowing not only for improved understanding of DIPG but also forming the basis  for protocols for personalized medicine in DIPG. However, current options for  personalized medicine in DIPG are limited by the lack of efficacious targeted  therapies for the mutations commonly found in DIPG. Multiple treatment modalities  including targeted therapies, immunotherapy, convection-enhanced delivery, and  focused ultrasound are in various stages of investigation.

Indeed, gliomas pose a significant challenge to neurosurgical  oncology because of their diverse histopathological features, genetic  heterogeneity, and clinical manifestations. Relevant sections: This study focuses  on glioma complexity by reviewing recent advances in their management, also  considering new classification systems and emerging neurosurgical techniques. To  bridge the gap between new neurosurgical approaches and standards of care, the  importance of molecular diagnosis and the use of techniques such as laser  interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) and focused ultrasound (FUS) are emphasized,  exploring how the integration of molecular knowledge with emerging neurosurgical  approaches can personalize and improve the treatment of gliomas. CONCLUSIONS: The  choice between LITT and FUS should be tailored to each case, considering factors  such as tumor characteristics and patient health. LITT is favored for larger,  complex tumors, while FUS is standard for smaller, deep-seated ones. Both  techniques are equally effective for small and superficial tumors.

Ray tracing is a computationally efficient  method that can correct skull-induced phase aberrations via per-element phase  delay calculations using patient-specific computed tomography (CT) data. However,  recent studies show that variations in CT-derived Hounsfield unit may account for  only 50% of the speed of sound variability in human skull specimens, potentially  limiting clinical transcranial ultrasound applications. Therefore, understanding  the sensitivity of treatment planning methods to material parameter variations is  essential. The present work uses a ray-tracing simulation model to explore how  imprecision in model inputs, arising from clinically significant uncertainties in  skull properties or considerations of acoustic phenomena, affects acoustic  focusing quality through the skull.

However, their efficacy for tremor reduction  and, importantly, adverse event incidence have not been directly compared.  OBJECTIVE: To present a comprehensive systematic review with network  meta-analysis examining both efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of FUS-T vs SRS-T  for treating medically refractory ET. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review  and network meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, using the PubMed and Embase  databases. We included all primary FUS-T/SRS-T studies with approximately 1-year  follow-up, with unilateral Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale or Clinical  Rating Scale for Tremor scores prethalamotomy/post-thalamotomy and/or AEs. The  primary efficacy outcome was Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale A+B score  reduction. AEs were reported as an estimated incidence. RESULTS: Fifteen studies  of 464 patients and 3 studies of 62 patients met inclusion criteria for  FUS-T/SRS-T efficacy comparison, respectively. Network meta-analysis demonstrated  similar tremor reduction between modalities (absolute tremor reduction: FUS-T:  -11.6 (95% CI: -13.3, -9.9); SRS-T: -10.3 (95% CI: -14.2, -6.0). FUS-T had a  greater 1-year adverse event rate, particularly imbalance and gait disturbances  (10.5%) and sensory disturbances (8.3%). Contralateral hemiparesis (2.7%) often  accompanied by speech impairment (2.4%) were most common after SRS-T. There was  no correlation between efficacy and lesion volume. CONCLUSION: Our systematic  review found similar efficacy between FUS-T and SRS-T for ET, with trend toward  higher efficacy yet greater adverse event incidence with FUS-T.

We aimed to study the feasibility of stimulating the  bilateral primary motor cortices (M1) with accelerated theta-burst TUS (a-tbTUS)  on neurophysiologic and clinical outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS:  Patients were randomly assigned to receive active or sham a-tbTUS for the first  visit and the alternate condition on the second visit, at least 10 days apart.  a-tbTUS was administered in three consecutive sonications at 30-minute intervals.  We used an accelerated protocol to produce an additive effect of stimulation.  Patients were studied in the OFF-medication state. Transcranial magnetic  stimulation (TMS)-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were used to assess  motor cortical excitability before and after TUS. Clinical outcomes after a-tbTUS  administration were assessed using the Movement Disorder Society Unified  Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)-III. RESULTS: A total of 20 visits  were conducted in 10 PD patients. Compared to the baseline, TMS-elicited MEP  amplitudes significantly increased following active but not sham sonication  (P = 0.0057). MEP amplitudes were also higher following a-tbTUS than sham  sonication (P = 0.0064). There were no statistically significant changes in  MDS-UPDRS-III scores with active or sham a-tbTUS.

Transporters mediate the uptake or efflux of compounds  to and from the brain and they can also challenge the delivery of drugs for the  treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently there is a limited understanding  of changes in BBB transporters in AD. To investigate this, we generated brain  endothelial-like cells (iBECs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with  familial AD (FAD) Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutation and identified AD-specific  differences in transporter expression compared to control (ctrl) iBECs. We first  characterized the expression levels of 12 BBB transporters in AD-, Ctrl-, and  isogenic (PSEN1 corrected) iBECs to identify any AD specific differences. We then  exposed the cells to focused ultrasound (FUS) in the absence (FUS(only)) or  presence of microbubbles (MB) (FUS(+MB)), which is a novel therapeutic method  that can be used to transiently open the BBB to increase drug delivery into the  brain, however its effects on BBB transporter expression are largely unknown.  Following FUS(only) and FUS(+MB), we investigated whether the expression or  activity of key transporters could be modulated. Our findings demonstrate that  PSEN1 mutant FAD (PSEN1(AD)) possess phenotypical differences compared to control  iBECs in BBB transporter expression and function. Additionally, we show that  FUS(only) and FUS(+MB) can modulate BBB transporter expression and functional  activity in iBECs, having potential implications on drug penetration and amyloid  clearance. These findings highlight the differential responses of patient cells  to FUS treatment, with patient-derived models likely providing an important tool  for modelling therapeutic effects of FUS.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e00299","","1","21","","Neurotherapeutics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

The objective of this study was to determine the  efficacy of MFU for facial rejuvenation and patients' satisfaction with the  treatment. METHOD: Articles published before December 2022 were retrieved using  PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. The retrieved  literature was screened according to strict criteria, and the risk of bias of  each study was assessed. RESULT: A total of 13 MFU studies for facial  rejuvenation and tightening were included, involving 477 participants. Efficacy  was assessed using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), and  meta-analysis showed an overall response rate of 0.77 (95%CI: 0.58, 0.96) at 90  days after intervention and 0.69 (95%CI: 0.51, 0.87) at 180 days. 0.78 (95%CI:  0.61, 0.95) and 0.71 (95%CI: 0.54, 0.87) patients were satisfied and very  satisfied overall at 90 days and 180 days, respectively. The pain score was on a  10-point scale, and the overall score was 3.10 (95%CI: 2.71, 3.94). There were no  instances during treatment where patients could not tolerate pain. Sensitivity  analysis showed that the results were robust. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, MFU is  an effective way to treat facial rejuvenation and tightening. More large-sample,  multicenter and randomized studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment  parameters in the future.

However, the limitations of the DTI  algorithm affect the accuracy of visualizing anatomical structures due to its  low-quality fiber tractography, whereas the application of the generalized  q-sampling imaging (GQI) algorithm enables the visualization of high-quality  fiber tracts, offering detailed insights into the spatial distribution of motor  cortex fibers. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the usefulness of  high-precision fiber tractography using the GQI algorithm as a planning image in  TcMRgFUS to achieve favorable clinical outcomes. METHODS: This study included 20  patients who underwent TcMRgFUS. The Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST)  scores and MR images were evaluated pretreatment and at 24 hours and 3-6 months  after treatment. Cases were classified based on the presence and adversity of  adverse events (AEs): no AEs, mild AEs without additional treatment, and severe  AEs requiring prolonged hospitalization. Fiber tractography of the Vim, Vc, and  PT was visualized using the DTI and GQI algorithm. The overlapping volume between  Vim fibers and the lesion was measured, and correlation analysis was performed.  The relationship between AEs and the overlapping volume of the Vc and PT fibers  within the lesions was examined. The cutoff value to achieve a favorable clinical  outcome and avoid AEs was determined using receiver operating characteristic  curve analysis. RESULTS: All patients showed improvement in tremors 24 hours  after treatment, with 3 patients experiencing mild AEs and 1 patient experiencing  severe AEs. At the 3- to 6-month follow-up, 5 patients experienced recurrence,  and 2 patients had persistent mild AEs. Although fiber visualization in the motor  cortex using the DTI algorithm was insufficient, the GQI algorithm enabled the  visualization of significantly higher-quality fibers. A strong correlation was  observed between the overlapping volume that intersects the lesion and Vim fibers  and the degree of tremor improvement (r = 0.72). Higher overlapping volumes of Vc  and PT within the lesion were associated with an increased likelihood of AEs (p <  0.05); the cutoff volume of Vim fibers within the lesion for a favorable clinical  outcome was 401 mm3, while the volume of Vc and PT within the lesion to avoid AEs  was 99 mm3. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that incorporating the  high-precision GQI algorithm for fiber tractography as a planning imaging  technique for TcMRgFUS has the potential to enhance targeting precision and  achieve favorable clinical outcomes.","2023-11-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1-11","","","","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37948701","","","","diffusion tensor imaging; functional neurosurgery; generalized q-sampling imaging algorithm; targeting method; transcranial magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound; ventral intermediate nucleus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The success of the treatment greatly depends on  achieving precise and efficient intraoperative focus. However, compensating for  aberrated ultrasound waves caused by the skull through numerical simulation-based  phase corrections is a challenging task due to the significant computational  burden involved in solving the acoustic wave equation. In this article, we  propose a promising strategy using the coupling of the boundary integral equation  method (BIEM) and the finite element method (FEM) to overcome the above  limitation. Specifically, we adopt the BIEM to obtain the Robin-to-Dirichlet maps  on the boundaries of the skull and then couple the maps to the FEM matrices via a  dual interpolation technique, resulting in a computational domain including only  the skull. Three simulation experiments were conducted to evaluate the  effectiveness of the proposed method, including a convergence test and two  skull-induced aberration corrections in 2D and 3D ultrasound. The results show  that the method's convergence is guaranteed as the element size decreases,  leading to a decrease in pressure error. The computation times for simulating a  500 kHz ultrasound field on a regular desktop computer were found to be  0.47 ± 0.01 s in the 2D case and 43.72 ± 1.49 s in the 3D case, provided that  lower-upper decomposition (approximately 13 s in 2D and 2.5 h in 3D) was  implemented in advance. We also demonstrated that more accurate transcranial  focusing can be achieved by phase correction compared to the noncorrected results  (with errors of 1.02 mm vs. 6.45 mm in 2D and 0.28 mm vs. 3.07 mm in 3D). The  proposed strategy is valuable for enabling online ultrasound simulations during  treatment, facilitating real-time adjustments and interventions.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","107181","","","137","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Images obtained immediately following MRgFUS ablation were inputs for voxel-wise  supervised learning classifiers, trained using registered histology as a label  for thermal necrosis. METHODS: VX2 tumors in New Zealand white rabbits quadriceps  were thermally ablated using an MRgFUS system under 3 T MRI guidance. Animals  were re-imaged three days post-ablation and euthanized. Histological necrosis  labels were created by 3D registration between MR images and digitized H&E  segmentations of thermal necrosis to enable voxel-wise classification of  necrosis. Supervised MPMR classifier inputs included maximum temperature rise,  cumulative thermal dose (CTD), post-FUS differences in T2-weighted images, and  apparent diffusion coefficient, or ADC, maps.

RESULTS: In the validation dataset, the  MPMR classifiers achieved higher recall and Dice than a clinically adopted 240  cumulative equivalent minutes at 43 (°)C (CEM (43)) threshold (0.43) in all  subjects. The average Dice scores of overlap with the registered histological  label for the logistic regression (0.63) and support vector machine (0.63) MPMR  classifiers were within 6% of the acute contrast-enhanced non-perfused volume  (0.67).

We highlight our technique using a case of salvage prostatectomy  after initial high-intensity focused ultrasound for recurrent high-risk prostate  cancer requiring future adjuvant radiation treatment. We have also successfully  used this technique in the management of recurrent vesicovaginal, colovesical,  rectourethral fistulas, and postradiation salvage prostatectomy setting.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our first patient underwent salvage radical prostatectomy  after developing high-risk localized prostate cancer after initial high-intensity  focused ultrasound. The prostate was radically resected after stepwise posterior  and anterior dissections. A flap of perivesical fat with a wide-based pedicle  overlying the bladder dome was developed until it was rotated, positioned, and  tethered overlying the anterior rectal wall in a tension-free manner. This  perivesical fat interposition may have protected a radiated anterior rectal wall  from future complications. In the second case, a recurrent vesicovaginal fistula  that persisted for 2years postabdominal hysterectomy was repaired using the  robotic approach. After fistula excision, layer closure, and perivesical flap  interposition, successful repair was achieved. The third patient, who had a  history of colon cancer managed with partial colectomy and radiation, developed a  recurrent colovesical fistula, which was successfully repaired. Postrepair, a  perivesical flap was developed and secured over the site. RESULTS: In the  immediate postoperative follow-up period, there were no surgical complications.  Long-term follow-up ranges from 1month to 3years without evidence of  complication. CONCLUSION: In cases where omentum interposition is not feasible,  our novel technique of a perivesical fat flap is a successful alternative for  complex reconstruction.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","182","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Although recent studies have shown that mechanical stress plays an important role in ultrasound neuromodulation, the magnitude and distribution of  the mechanical stress generated in tissues by focused ultrasound transducers have  not been adequately examined. Various acoustic radiation force (ARF) equations  used in previous studies have been evaluated based on the tissue displacement  results and are suitable for estimating the displacement. However, it is unclear  whether mechanical stress can be accurately determined. This study evaluates the  mechanical stress predicted by various AFR equations and suggests the optimal  equation for estimating the mechanical stress in the brain tissue.Approach. In  this paper, brain tissue responses are compared through numerical finite element  simulations by applying the three most used ARF equations-Reynolds stress force  ((RSF)), momentum flux density tensor force, and attenuation force. Three ARF  fields obtained from the same pressure field were applied to the linear elastic  model to calculate the displacement, mechanical stress, and mean pressure  generated inside the tissue. Both the simple pressure field using a single  transducer and the complex standing wave pressure field using two transducers  were simulated.Main results. For the case using a single transducer, all three  ARFs showed similar displacement. However, when comparing the mechanical stress  results, only the results using the RSF showed a strong stress tensor at the  focal point. For the case of using two transducers, the displacement and stress  tensor field of the pattern related to the standing wave were calculated only  from the results using the RSF.Significance. The model using RSF equation allows  accurate analysis on stress tensor inside the tissue for ultrasound  neuromodulation.","2023-06-27","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","13","68","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37366067  PMCID: PMC10404470","","","","*Acoustics; *Brain/diagnostic imaging; Motion; Stress, Mechanical; Transducers; Ultrasonography; acoustic radiation force; neuromodulation; stress tensor; transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These symptoms increase  with disease severity, ranging from 10% in mild cognitive impairment to 50% in  patients with moderate-to-severe AD, pose a great risk for self-injury and injury  to caregivers, result in high rates of institutionalization and great suffering  for patients and families. Current pharmacological therapies have limited  efficacy and a high potential for severe side effects. Thus, there is a growing  need to develop novel therapeutics tailored to safely and effectively reduce  agitation and aggressive behavior in AD. Here, we investigate for the first time  the use of focused ultrasound combined with anesthetic-loaded nanodroplets  (nanoFUS) targeting the amygdala (key structure in the neurocircuitry of  agitation) as a novel minimally invasive tool to modulate local neural activity  and reduce agitation and aggressive behavior in the TgCRND8 AD transgenic mice.  METHODS: Male and female animals were tested in the resident-intruder (i.e.,  aggressive behavior) and open-field tests (i.e., motor agitation) for baseline  measures, followed by treatment with active- or sham-nanoFUS. Behavioral testing  was then repeated after treatment. RESULTS: Active-nanoFUS neuromodulation  reduced aggressive behavior and agitation in male mice, as compared to  sham-treated controls. Treatment with active-nanoFUS increased the time male mice  spent in social-non-aggressive behaviors. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that  neuromodulation with active-nanoFUS may be a potential therapeutic tool for the  treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms, with special focus on agitation and  aggressive behaviors. Further studies are necessary to establish cellular,  molecular and long-term behavioral changes following treatment with nanoFUS.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","507-519","","4","10","","Ann Clin Transl Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

However, its impact on the brain  structural network is still unclear. PURPOSE: To investigate both global and  local alterations of the white matter (WM) connectivity network in ET after  MRgFUS thalamotomy. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. SUBJECTS: Twenty-seven ET patients  (61 ± 11 years, 19 males) with MRgFUS thalamotomy and 28 healthy controls (HC)  (61 ± 11 years, 20 males) were recruited for comparison. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE:  A 3 T/single shell diffusion tensor imaging by using spin-echo-based echo-planar  imaging, three-dimensional T1 weighted imaging by using gradient-echo-based  sequence. ASSESSMENT: Patients were undergoing MRgFUS thalamotomy and their  clinical data were collected from pre-operation to 6-month post-operation.  Network topological metrics, including rich-club organization, small-world, and  efficiency properties were calculated. Correlation between the topological  metrics and tremor scores in ET groups was also calculated to assess the role of  neural remodeling in the brain. STATISTICAL TESTS: Two-sample independent  t-tests, chi-squared test, ANOVA, Bonferroni test, and Spearman's correlation.  Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: For ET patients, the  strength of rich-club connection and clustering coefficient significantly  increased vs. characteristic path length decreased at 6-month post-operation  compared with pre-operation. The distribution pattern of rich-club regions was  different in ET groups. Specifically, the order of the rich-club regions was  changed according to the network degree value after MRgFUS thalamotomy. Moreover,  the altered nodal efficiency in the right temporal pole of the superior temporal  gyrus (R = 0.434-0.596) and right putamen (R = 0.413-0.436) was positively  correlated with different tremor improvement.

Transcranial Focused Ultrasound (TFUS) has been examined as a way to stimulate  non-invasively, but previous studies have limitations in the application of TFUS.  As a result, refinement is needed to improve stimulation results. NEW METHOD: We  utilized a custom-built capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT)  that would send ultrasonic waves through skin and skull to targets located in the  Frontal Eye Fields (FEF) region triangulated from co-registered MRI and CT scans  while a non-human primate subject was performing a discrimination behavioral  task. RESULTS: We observed that the stimulation immediately caused changes in the  local field potential (LFP) signal that continued until stimulation ended, at  which point there was higher voltage upon the cue for the animal to saccade. This  co-incided with increases in activity in the alpha band during stimulation. The  activity rebounded mid-way through our electrode-shank, indicating a specific  point of stimulation along the shank. We observed different LFP signals for  different stimulation targets, indicating the ability to""steer"" the stimulation  through the transducer. We also observed a bias in first saccades towards the  opposite direction. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we provide a new approach for  non-invasive stimulation during performance of a behavioral task. With the  ability to steer stimulation patterns and target using a large amount of  transducers, the ability to provide non-invasive stimulation will be greatly  improved for future clinical and research applications.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","110009","","","402","","J Neurosci Methods","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Only cholinesterase  inhibitors and a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist have been approved for  treating patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and their clinical effects  remained limited. Medical devices serve as an alternative therapeutic approach to  modulating neural activities and enhancing cognitive function. Four major brain  stimulation technologies including deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and  transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) have been applied to AD in a clinical  trial setting. DBS allows electrical stimulation at the specified nucleus but  remains resource-demanding, and after all, an invasive surgery; whereas TMS and  tDCS are widely available and affordable but less ideal with respect to  localization. The unique physical property of TUS, on the other hand, allows both  thermal and mechanical energy to be transduced and focused for neuromodulation.  In the context of dementia, using focused ultrasound to induce blood-brain  barrier opening for delivering drugs and metabolizing amyloid protein has drawn  great attention in recent years. Furthermore, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound has  demonstrated its neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies,  leading to ongoing clinical trials for AD.

Single-element passive cavitation detectors provide limited spatial  information regarding MB activity, greatly affecting the performance of acoustic  control. However, an array of receivers can be used to spatially map cavitation  events and thus improve treatment control. The spectral content of the acoustic  emissions provides additional information that can be correlated with the  bio-effects, and wideband receivers can thus provide the most complete spectral  information. Here, we develop a miniature polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF thickness  = 110 μm, active area = 1.2 mm(2)) broadband receiver for the acoustic monitoring  of MBs. The receiver has superior sensitivity (2.36-3.87 V/MPa) to those of a  commercial fibre-optic hydrophone in the low megahertz frequency range (0.51-5.4  MHz). The receiver also has a wide -6 dB acceptance angle (54 degrees at 1.1 MHz  and 13 degrees at 5.4 MHz) and the ability to detect subharmonic and higher  harmonic MB emissions in phantoms. The overall acoustic performance of this  low-cost receiver indicates its suitability for the eventual use within an array  for MB monitoring and mapping in preclinical studies.","2023-01-26","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","3","23","","Sensors (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36772406  PMCID: PMC9921684","","","","*Brain/diagnostic imaging; *Microbubbles; Acoustics; Blood-Brain Barrier/diagnostic imaging; Polyvinyls; blood–brain barrier; focused ultrasound (FUS); hydrophone; micromachining; transcranial therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the impact of confounding factors such as  aging and gut microbiota composition on therapeutic outcomes remains poorly  understood. In this study, we sequentially treated young mice (∼8 weeks) and old  mice (>18 months) with bilateral melanoma using FUS and calreticulin  nanoparticles (CRT-NP) to enhance immunogenic cell death. The combination of  CRT-NP and FUS (CFUS) demonstrated greater efficacy in inducing regression of  treated and untreated tumors in young mice compared to old mice. The diminished  effectiveness in older mice was associated with significant differences in gut  microbiome composition, characterized by alterations in bacterial species and  splenic immune cells. Specifically, young mice exposed to CFUS exhibited higher  abundance of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia, which was not observed in the  aged cohorts. Turicibacter, Anaerotruncus, and Ruminiclostridium demonstrated  negative correlations with CD8+ T cells but positive correlations with CD4+ T  cells and MDSC cells in both age groups. Taxon set enrichment analysis revealed  58 significantly enriched host gene targets in the young cluster compared to only  11 in the aged cluster. These findings highlight the relationship between ISV  treatment efficacy and gut microbiome composition, suggesting that interventions  such as diet modification, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation may  hold potential as therapeutic strategies to enhance immune responses against  solid tumors.","2023-10-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","112268","","","181","","Exp Gerontol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Accurate control of the focus position and  strength of the TUS acoustic waves is important to enable a beneficial use of the  high spatial resolution and to ensure safety. As the human skull causes strong  attenuation and distortion of the waves, simulations of the transmitted waves are  needed to accurately determine the TUS dose distribution inside the cranial  cavity. The simulations require information of the skull morphology and its  acoustic properties. Ideally, they are informed by computed tomography (CT)  images of the individual head. However, suited individual imaging data is often  not readily available. For this reason, we here introduce and validate a head  template that can be used to estimate the average effects of the skull on the TUS  acoustic wave in the population. The template was created from CT images of the  heads of 29 individuals of different ages (between 20-50 years), gender and  ethnicity using an iterative non-linear co-registration procedure. For  validation, we compared acoustic and thermal simulations based on the template to  the average of the simulation results of all 29 individual datasets. Acoustic  simulations were performed for a model of a focused transducer driven at 500 kHz,  placed at 24 standardized positions by means of the EEG 10-10 system. Additional  simulations at 250 kHz and 750 kHz at 16 of the positions were used for further  confirmation. The amount of ultrasound-induced heating at 500 kHz was estimated  for the same 16 transducer positions. Our results show that the template  represents the median of the acoustic pressure and temperature maps from the  individuals reasonably well in most cases. This underpins the usefulness of the  template for the planning and optimization of TUS interventions in studies of  healthy young adults. Our results further indicate that the amount of variability  between the individual simulation results depends on the position. Specifically,  the simulated ultrasound-induced heating inside the skull exhibited strong  interindividual variability for three posterior positions close to the midline,  caused by a high variability of the local skull shape and composition. This  should be taken into account when interpreting simulation results based on the  template.","2023-08-15","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","120227","","","277","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023.

The major challenge to the in vivo implementation of  light-based methods in deep-seated structures of the brain or of internal organs  is the limited penetration of photons in biological tissue. The presence of light  scattering and absorption has resulted in the development of invasive techniques  such as the implantation of optical fibers, the insertion of endoscopes and the  surgical removal of overlying tissues to overcome light attenuation and deliver  it deep into the body. However, these procedures are highly invasive and make it  difficult to reposition and adjust the illuminated area in each animal. Here, we  detail a noninvasive approach to deliver light (termed 'deLight') in deep tissue  via systemically injected mechanoluminescent nanotransducers that can be gated by  using focused ultrasound. This approach achieves localized light emission with  sub-millimeter resolution and millisecond response times in any vascularized  organ of living mice without requiring invasive implantation of light-emitting  devices. For example, deLight enables optogenetic neuromodulation in live mice  without a craniotomy or brain implants. deLight provides a generalized method for  applications that require a light source in deep tissues in vivo, such as  deep-brain fluorescence imaging and photoactivatable genome editing. The  implementation of the entire protocol for an in vivo application takes ~1-2  weeks.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","3787-3820","","12","18","","Nat Protoc","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

This kind of procedure requires caution because the wrong regulation can either  limit the treatment or aggravate an existing injury. Therefore, determining the  temperature in a region of interest in real-time is a subject of high interest.  Although this is still an open problem, in the field of ultrasound analysis, the  use of machine learning as a tool for both imaging and automated diagnostics are  application trends. In this work, a data-driven approach is proposed to address  the problem of estimating the temperature in regions of a B-mode ultrasound image  as a supervised learning problem. The proposal consists in presenting a novel  data modeling for the problem that includes information retrieved from  conventional B-mode ultrasound images and a parametric image built based on  changes in backscattered energy (CBE). Then, we compare the performance of  classic models in the literature. The computational results presented that, in a  simulated scenario, the proposed approach that a Gradient Boosting model would be  able to estimate the temperature with a mean absolute error of around 0.5°C,  which is acceptable in practical environments both in physiotherapic treatments  and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","3-16","","1","46","","Ultrason Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38041411","","","","*Temperature; B-mode images; Humans; Ultrasonography/methods; machine learning; supervised learning; temperature estimation; ultrasound imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using computed  tomography-derived human vertebral geometry, transvertebral detection of MBs is  evaluated over varying source locations with and without phase and amplitude  corrections (PACs). The impact of prefocal cavitation is studied by simulating  concurrent cavitation events in the canal and pre-laminar region. Spatially  sensitive application of phase and amplitude is used to balance signal strengths  emanating from different axial depths in combination with multiple dynamic ranges  to elicit multisource viewing. Collectively, the results of this study encourage  the use of PAM in transvertebral FUS applications with PACs to not only localize  sources originating in the spinal canal but also multiple sources of innate  amplitude mismatches when corrective methods are applied.","2023-04-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2271","","4","153","","J Acoust Soc Am","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Acoustical Society of America.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37092915","","","","*Acoustics; *Microbubbles; Animals; Humans; Models, Animal; Spinal Cord","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this method compromises  slightly on accuracy compared to simulation-based methods. This study evaluates a  fast simulation method that simulates the time-harmonic pressure field within the  region of interest for effective phase correction. Experimental validation was  carried out using a 512-element, 670 kHz hemispherical transducer for fourex  vivoskulls. The ray tracing method achieved a restoration ratio of 64.81% ± 4.33%  of acoustic intensity normalized to hydrophone measurements. In comparison, the  rapid simulation method demonstrated improved results with a restoration ratio of  73.10% ± 7.46%, albeit slightly lower than the full-wave simulation which  achieved a restoration ratio of 75.87% ± 5.40%. The rapid simulation methods  exhibited computational times that were less than five minutes for parallel  computation with 8 threads. The incident angle was calculated, and a maximum  difference of 6.8 degrees was found when the fixed position of the skull was  changed. Meanwhile, the restoration ratio of acoustic intensity was validated to  be above 70% for different target positions away from the geometrical focus of  the transducer. The favorable balance between time consumption and correction  accuracy makes this method valuable for clinical treatment applications.","2023-12-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","23","68","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37934058","","","","*Skull/diagnostic imaging; *Ultrasonic Therapy/methods; Acoustics; Brain; Computer Simulation; Humans; Software; phase correction; pressure field simulation; transcranial focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From these equations, a model that  predicts the time-averaged flow on the macroscopic scale, as well as the  advective transport of the trace components, is created. The model is used to  perform simulations for different shapes of the focused ultrasound beam. For a  given shape, and using the paraxial approximation for the ultrasound, the  acoustic streaming is found to be linearly proportional to the applied ultrasound  intensity, to the permeability of the porous material and to the attenuation  coefficient, and inversely proportional to the liquid viscosity. Results from  simulations are compared to a simplified expression stating that the  dimensionless volumetric liquid flux is equal to the dimensionless acoustic  radiation force. This approximation for the acoustic streaming is found to be  reasonable near the beam axis for focused ultrasound beam shapes that are long in  the axial direction, compared to their width. Finally, a comparison is made  between the model and experimental results on acoustic streaming in a gel, and  good agreement is found.","2023-07-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","334-345","","1","154","","J Acoust Soc Am","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Acoustical Society of America.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37458513","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using univariate and  multivariate logistic regression, risk factors for re-intervention were assessed.  RESULTS: Among 401 patients with UFs who completed the follow-up visits (median  47 months, range 34-61), 50 (12.46%) patients underwent re-intervention (such as  high-intensity focused ultrasound, uterine artery embolization, myomectomy and  hysterectomy).

Polynucleotide (PN) products have become popular, but there is  surprisingly little guidance on their use. We aimed to maximize the safety and  efficacy of injectable PN by providing information on their pattern of practice  among board-certified dermatologists. METHODS: A total of 235 Korean  board-certified dermatologists familiar with skin boosters participated in a  survey which questioned the participant's years of practice, selection of skin  boosters in one's clinic, and range of lasers and light sources as well as skin  care devices that are available. For those who use PN, one was asked to check all  its aesthetic indications, mode of delivery, injection depth, treatment interval  as well as options for combined therapy. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of the  survey participants had at least 5 years of professional experience as a  board-certified dermatologist, and among the different skin boosters, 88% replied  that they practiced PN injection. The top six indications for PN were fine lines  on the cheek followed by infraorbital fine lines, periorbital fine lines, uneven  skin texture, dry skin, and fine lines on the forehead. Many opted for a 33G  needle and the serial puncture technique targeting the dermis. A total of three  sessions of PN injection spaced 4 weeks apart is most often recommended. 79  percent of PN users blended PN injection with lasers and light therapy with the  most popular being radiofrequency (non-invasive, needle RF) and high-intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU). CONCLUSION: PN is a skin booster which is widely  practiced among Korean dermatologists. According to our survey, the best  indication of PN is facial fine lines, and as such PN injection is often repeated  and combined with a variety of non-surgical rejuvenation procedures. We hope our  data help dermatologists better understand and utilize PN injection.","2023-12-13","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

However, it is a major challenge to  create dynamic functionalities and to manipulate the physical properties of the  inherently insoluble and infusible cross-linked material generated from VP-3DP  without reproduction. The fabrication of light- and high-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU)-responsive cross-linked polymeric materials linked with  hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) in polymer chains based on VP-3DP is reported here.  Although the photochemistry of HABI produces triphenylimidazolyl radicals (TPIRs)  during the process of VP-3DP, the orthogonality of the photochemistry of HABI and  photopolymerization enables the introduction of reversible cross-links derived  from HABIs in the resulting 3D-printed objects. While photostimulation cleaves a  covalent bond between two imidazoles in HABI to generate TPIRs only near the  surface of the 3D-printed objects, HIFU triggers cleavage in the interior of  materials. In addition, HIFU travels beyond an obstacle to induce a response of  HABI-embedded cross-linked polymers, which cannot be attainable with  photostimulation. The present system would be beneficial for tuning the physical  properties and recycling of various polymeric materials, but it will also open  the door for pinpoint modification, healing, and reshaping of materials when  coupled to various dynamic covalent materials.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e2304104","","39","35","","Adv Mater","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

It has a fast convergence speed and strong global search ability.  However, SSA also has many shortcomings, such as the unstable quality of the  initial population, easy to fall into the local optimal solution, and the  diversity of the population decreases with the iterative process. In order to  solve these problems, this paper proposes an improved sparrow search algorithm  (ISSA). ISSA uses Chebyshev chaotic map and elite opposition-based learning  strategy to initialize the population and improve the quality of the initial  population. In the process of producer location update, dynamic weight factor and  Levy flight strategy are introduced to avoid falling into a local optimal  solution. The mutation strategy is applied to the scrounger location update  process, and the mutation operation is performed on individuals to increase the  diversity of the population. In order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness  of ISSA, it is tested on 23 benchmark functions. The results show that compared  with other seven algorithms, ISSA has higher convergence accuracy, faster  convergence speed, and stronger stability. Finally, ISSA is used to optimize the  sound field of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). The results show that  ISSA can effectively improve the focusing performance and reduce the influence of  sound field sidelobe, which is of great benefit for HIFU treatment.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1228685","","","2023","","Comput Intell Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Yihao Yang et al.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36909963  PMCID: PMC10005866","","","","*Algorithms; *Benchmarking; Humans; Intelligence; Mutation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to develop robust radiomics models  for predicting the prognosis of HIFU-treated uterine fibroids and to explain the  internal predictive process of the model using Shapley additive explanations  (SHAP). METHODS: This retrospective study included 300 patients with uterine  fibroids who received HIFU and were classified as having a favorable or  unfavorable prognosis based on the postoperative nonperfusion volume ratio.  Patients were divided into a training set (N = 240) and a test set (N = 60). The  1295 radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and  contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) scans. After data preprocessing  and feature filtering, radiomics models were constructed by extreme gradient  boosting and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and the optimal  performance was obtained by Bayesian optimization. Finally, the SHAP approach was  used to explain the internal prediction process. RESULTS: The models constructed  using LightGBM had the best performance, and the AUCs of the T2WI and CE-T1WI  models were 87.2 (95% CI = 87.1-87.5) and 84.8 (95% CI = 84.6-85.7),  respectively. The use of SHAP technology can help physicians understand the  impact of radiomic features on the predicted outcomes of the model from a global  and individual perspective. CONCLUSION: Multiparametric radiomic models have  shown their robustness in predicting HIFU prognosis. Radiomic features can be a  potential source of biomarkers to support preoperative assessment of HIFU  treatment and improve the understanding of uterine fibroid heterogeneity.  CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: An interpretable radiomics model can help  clinicians to effectively predict the prognosis of HIFU treatment for uterine  fibroids. The heterogeneity of fibroids can be characterized by various radiomics  features and the application of SHAP can be used to visually explain the  prediction process of radiomics models.","2023-07-19","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","129","","1","14","","Insights Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

However, there  are limitations with nonuniformity of cancer tissue destruction, heat sink effect  and the risk of thermal ablative injury. The current non-thermal ablative  techniques have high risk of local recurrence and are not widely adopted.  Histotripsy is a treatment technology that destroys targeted tissue under  ultrasound visualization via mechanical destruction through the precise  application of acoustic cavitation and can offer the potential of non-invasive,  non-thermal and non-ionizing radiation cancer treatment. The aim of this  multi-centre non-randomized phase I/II trial is to assess the initial safety and  efficacy of the prototype investigational 'System' in the treatment of primary  and metastatic liver cancers. METHODS/DESIGN: All non-surgical patients with  primary/metastatic liver cancers having had previous liver directed therapy,  radiation therapy or image-guided ablation may be offered image-guided  Histotripsy as per trial protocol. The co-primary endpoints are technical success  and procedural safety. Technical success is determined, at ≤ 36 h post procedure,  by evaluating the histotripsy treatment size and coverage. The procedural safety  is defined by procedure related major complications, defined as Common  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5) grade 3 or higher  toxicities, up to 30 days post procedure.

While it is well established  that the behaviors of microbubbles are altered when they are situated within  sufficiently small vessels, there is a paucity of data examining how the bubble  population dynamics and emissions change as a function of channel (vessel)  diameter over a size range relevant to therapeutic ultrasound, particularly at  pressures relevant to antivascular ultrasound. Here we use acoustic emissions  detection and high-speed microscopy (10 kframes/s) to examine the behavior of a  polydisperse clinically employed agent (Definity®) in wall-less channels as their  diameters are scaled from 1200 to 15 µm. Pressures are varied from 0.1 to 3 MPa  using either a 5 ms pulse or a sequence of 0.1 ms pulses spaced at 1 ms, both of  which have been previously employed in an in vivo context. With increasing  pressure, the 1200 µm channel - on the order of small arteries and veins -  exhibited inertial cavitation, 1/2 subharmonics and 3/2 ultraharmonics,  consistent with numerous previous reports. The 200 and 100 µm channels - in the  size range of larger microvessels less affected by therapeutic focused ultrasound  - exhibited a distinctly different behavior, having muted development of 1/2  subharmonics and 3/2 ultraharmonics and reduced persistence. These were  associated with radiation forces displacing bubbles to the distal wall and  inducing clusters that then rapidly dissipated along with emissions. As the  diameter transitioned to 50 and then 15 µm - a size regime that is most relevant  to therapeutic focused ultrasound - there was a higher threshold for the onset of  inertial cavitation as well as subharmonics and ultraharmonics, which importantly  had more complex orders that are not normally reported. Clusters also occurred in  these channels (e.g. at 3 MPa, the mean lateral and axial sizes were 23 and 72 µm  in the 15 µm channel; 50 and 90 µm in the 50 µm channel), however in this case  they occupied the entire lumens and displaced the wall boundaries. Damage to the  15 µm channel was observed for both pulse types, but at a lower pressure for the  long pulse. Experiments conducted with a 'nanobubble' (<0.45 µm) subpopulation of  Definity followed broadly similar features to 'native' Definity, albeit at a  higher pressure threshold for inertial cavitation. These results provide new  insights into the behavior of microbubbles in small vessels at higher pressures  and have implications for therapeutic focused ultrasound cavitation monitoring  and control.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","106291","","","93","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

We describe the initial experience from a  pilot, open-label, single-center clinical trial of unilateral anterior nucleus of  the thalamus (ANT) FUSA in patients with treatment-refractory epilepsy. METHODS:  Two adult subjects with treatment-refractory, focal onset epilepsy were  recruited. The subjects received ANT FUSA using the Exablate Neuro (Insightec)  system. We determined the safety and feasibility (primary outcomes), and changes  in seizure frequency (secondary outcome) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Safety was  assessed by the absence of side effects, that is, new onset neurological deficits  or performance deterioration on neuropsychological testing. Feasibility was  defined as the ability to create a lesion within the anterior nucleus. The  monthly seizure frequency was compared between baseline and postthalamotomy.  RESULTS: The patients tolerated the procedure well, without neurological deficits  or serious adverse events. One patient experienced a decline in verbal fluency,  attention/working memory, and immediate verbal memory. Seizure frequency reduced  significantly in both patients; one patient was seizure-free at 12 months, and in  the second patient, the frequency reduced from 90-100 seizures per month to 3-6  seizures per month.

One  localized, non-invasive method of administering mild hyperthermia is magnetic  resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU). However, challenges  for ultrasound such as beam deflection, refraction and coupling issues may result  in a misalignment of the HIFU focus and the tumor during hyperthermia. Currently,  the best option is to stop the treatment, wait for the tissue to cool, and redo  the treatment planning before restarting the hyperthermia. This current workflow  is both time-consuming and unreliable. PURPOSE: An adaptive targeting algorithm  was developed for MRgHIFU controlled hyperthermia treatments for cancer  therapeutics. This algorithm executes in real time while hyperthermia is being  administered to ensure that the focus is within our target region. If a mistarget  is detected, the HIFU system will electronically steer the focus of the HIFU beam  to the correct target. The goal of this study was to quantify the accuracy and  precision of the adaptive targeting algorithm's ability to correct a purposely  misplanned hyperthermia treatment in real-time using a clinical MRgHIFU system.  METHODS: A gelatin phantom with acoustic properties matched to the average speed  of sound in human tissue was used to test the adaptive targeting algorithm's  accuracy and precision. The target was purposely offset 10 mm away from the focus  at the origin, in four orthogonal directions, allowing the algorithm to correct  for this mistarget. In each direction, 10 data sets were collected for a total  sample size of 40. Hyperthermia was administered with a target temperature set at  42°C. The adaptive targeting algorithm was run during the hyperthermia treatment  and 20 thermometry images were collected after the beam steering occurred. The  location of the focus was quantified by calculating the center of heating on the  MR thermometry data. RESULTS: The average calculated trajectory passed to the  HIFU system was 9.7 mm ± 0.4 mm where the target trajectory was 10 mm. The  accuracy of the adaptive targeting algorithm after the beam steering correction  was 0.9 mm and the precision was 1.6 mm. CONCLUSION: The adaptive targeting  algorithm was implemented successfully and was able to correct the 10 mm  mistargets with high accuracy and precision in gelatin phantoms. The results  demonstrate the capability to correct the MRgHIFU focus location during  controlled hyperthermia.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","3347-3358","","6","50","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

Current histotripsy systems rely on ultrasound  imaging to target lesions. However, deep or isoechoic targets obstructed by bowel  gas or bone can often not be treated safely using ultrasound imaging alone. This  work presents an alternative x-ray C-arm based targeting approach and a fully  automated robotic targeting system. METHODS: The approach uses conventional cone  beam CT (CBCT) images to localize the target lesion and 2D fluoroscopy to  determine the 3D position and orientation of the histotripsy transducer relative  to the C-arm. The proposed pose estimation uses a digital model and deep  learning-based feature segmentation to estimate the transducer focal point  relative to the CBCT coordinate system. Additionally, the integrated robotic arm  was calibrated to the C-arm by estimating the transducer pose for four  preprogrammed transducer orientations and positions. The calibrated system can  then automatically position the transducer such that the focal point aligns with  any target selected in a CBCT image. RESULTS: The accuracy of the proposed  targeting approach was evaluated in phantom studies, where the selected target  location was compared to the center of the spherical ablation zones in  post-treatment CBCTs. The mean and standard deviation of the Euclidean distance  was 1.4 ±0.5 mm. The mean absolute error of the predicted treatment radius was  0.5 ±0.5 mm. CONCLUSION: CBCT-based histotripsy targeting enables accurate and  fully automated treatment without ultrasound guidance. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed  approach could considerably decrease operator dependency and enable treatment of  tumors not visible under ultrasound.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","592-602","","2","70","","IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35984807  PMCID: PMC9929026","","","","*Cone-Beam Computed Tomography/methods; Fluoroscopy/methods; Phantoms, Imaging; X-Rays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

FUS combined with microbubbles can temporarily open the  intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) of animals and humans, and facilitate drug  delivery. FUS exposure, either with or without microbubbles, has been  demonstrated to alter the behavior of non-human primates (NHP), and previous  studies have demonstrated the transient and long-term effects of FUS  neuromodulation on functional connectivity using resting state functional MRI.  The behavioral effects of FUS vary depending on whether or not it is applied in  conjunction with microbubbles to open the BBB, but it is unknown whether opening  the BBB affects functional connectivity differently than FUS alone. OBJECTIVE: To  compare the effects of applying FUS alone (FUS neuromodulation) and FUS with  microbubbles (FUS-BBB opening) on changes of resting state functional  connectivity in NHP. METHODS: We applied 2 min FUS exposure without  (neuromodulation) and with microbubbles (BBB opening) in the dorsal striatum of  lightly anesthetized non-human primates, and acquired resting state functional  MRI 40 min respectively after FUS exposure. The functional connectivity (FC) in  the cortex and major brain networks between the two approaches were measured and  compared. RESULTS: When applying FUS exposure to the caudate nucleus of NHP, we  found that both FUS neuromodulation can activate FC between caudate and insular  cortex, while inhibiting the FC between caudate and motor cortex. FUS-BBB opening  can activate FC between the caudate and medial prefrontal cortex, and within the  frontotemporal network (FTN). We also found both FUS and FUS-BBB opening can  significantly activate FC within the default mode network (DMN). CONCLUSION: The  results suggest applying FUS to a deep brain structure can alter functional  connectivity in the DMN and FTN, and that FUS neuromodulation and FUS-mediated  BBB opening can have different effects on patterns of functional connectivity.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1196-1204","","4","16","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Integration of thermosensitive liposome (TSL), as a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded  nanocarrier, and FUS, provides a promising drug delivery system. A fully coupled  partial differential system of equations, including the Helmholtz equation for  FUS propagation, bio-heat transfer, interstitial fluid flow, drug transport in  tissue and cellular spaces, and a pharmacodynamic model is first presented for  this treatment approach. Equations are then solved by finite element methods to  calculate intracellular drug concentration and treatment efficacy. The main  objective of this study is to present a multi-physics and multi-scale model to  simulate drug release, transport, and delivery to solid tumors, followed by an  analysis of how FUS exposure time and drug release rate affect these processes.  Our findings not only show the capability of model to replicate this therapeutic  approach, but also confirm the benefits of this treatment with an improvement of  drug aggregation in tumor and reduction of drug delivery in healthy tissue. For  instance, the survival fraction of tumor cells after this treatment dropped to  62.4%, because of a large amount of delivered drugs to cancer cells. Next, a  combination of three release rates (ultrafast, fast, and slow) and FUS exposure  times (10, 30, and 60 min) was examined.

However, better  methods to evaluate response to HIFU ablation are an unmet need.  Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and gastrin-releasing peptide receptors  are both overexpressed in PC. In this study, we evaluated a novel approach of  using both (68)Ga-RM2 and (68)Ga-PSMA11 PET/MRI in each patient before and after  HIFU to assess the accuracy of target tumor localization and response to  treatment. Methods: Fourteen men, 64.5 ± 8.0 y old (range, 48-78 y), with newly  diagnosed PC were prospectively enrolled. Before HIFU, the patients underwent  prostate biopsy, multiparametric MRI, (68)Ga-PSMA11, and (68)Ga-RM2 PET/MRI.  Response to treatment was assessed at a minimum of 6 mo after HIFU with prostate  biopsy (n = 13), as well as (68)Ga-PSMA11 and (68)Ga-RM2 PET/MRI (n = 14). The  SUV(max) and SUV(peak) of known or suspected PC lesions were collected. Results:  Pre-HIFU biopsy revealed 18 cancers, of which 14 were clinically significant  (Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4). Multiparametric MRI identified 18 lesions; 14 of them  were at least score 4 in the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System.  (68)Ga-PSMA11 and (68)Ga-RM2 PET/MRI each showed 23 positive intraprostatic  lesions; 21 were congruent in 13 patients, and 5 were incongruent in 5 patients.  Before HIFU, (68)Ga-PSMA11 identified all target tumors, whereas (68)Ga-RM2  PET/MRI missed 2 tumors. After HIFU, (68)Ga-RM2 and (68)Ga-PSMA11 PET/MRI both  identified clinically significant residual disease in 1 patient. Three  significant ipsilateral recurrent lesions were identified, whereas 1 was missed  by (68)Ga-PSMA11. The pretreatment level of prostate-specific antigen decreased  significantly after HIFU, by 66%. Concordantly, the pretreatment SUV(max)  decreased significantly after HIFU for (68)Ga-PSMA11 (P = 0.001) and (68)Ga-RM2  (P = 0.005). Conclusion: This pilot study showed that (68)Ga-PSMA11 and  (68)Ga-RM2 PET/MRI identified the target tumor for HIFU in 100% and 86% of cases,  respectively, and accurately verified response to treatment. PET may be a useful  tool in the guidance and monitoring of treatment success in patients receiving  focal therapy for PC. These preliminary findings warrant larger studies for  validation.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","592-597","","4","64","","J Nucl Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36328488","","","","*Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy; *Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/therapy/pathology; 68Ga-PSMA11; 68Ga-RM2; Gallium Radioisotopes; HIFU; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; PET; Pilot Projects; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography/methods; Positron-Emission Tomography; prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to  the altered path and intensity of sonication penetrating the skull, the focus and  intensity in the skull are difficult to determine, making the use of ultrasound  therapy for cancer treatment experimental and not widely available. The  deficiency can be effectively addressed by numerical simulation methods, which  enable the optimization of sonication modulation parameters and the determination  of precise transducer positioning. METHODS: A 3D skull model was established  using binarized brain CT images. The selection of the transducer matrix was  performed using the radius positioning (RP) method after identifying the  intracranial target region. Simulations were performed, encompassing acoustic  pressure (AP), acoustic field, and temperature field, in order to provide  compelling evidence of the safety of tFUS in sonication-induced thermal effects.  RESULTS: It was found that the angle of sonication path to the coronal plane  obtained at all precision and frequency models did not exceed 10° and 15° to the  transverse plane. The results of thermal effects illustrated that the peak  temperatures of tFUS were 43.73°C, which did not reach the point of tissue  degeneration. Once positioned, tFUS effectively delivers a Full Width at Half  Maximum (FWHM) stimulation that targets tumors with diameters of up to 3.72 mm in  a one-off. The original precision model showed an attenuation of 24.47 ± 6.13 mm  in length and 2.40 ± 1.42 mm in width for the FWHM of sonication after  penetrating the skull. CONCLUSION: The vector angles of the sonication path in  each direction were determined based on the transducer positioning results. It  has been suggested that when time is limited for precise transducer positioning,  fixing the transducer on the horizontal surface of the target region can also  yield positive results for stimulation. This framework used a new transducer  localization method to offer a reliable basis for further research and offered  new methods for the use of tFUS in brain tumor-related research.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1277906","","","17","","Front Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Gao, Sun, Zhang, Li and Wang.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37904813  PMCID: PMC10613465","","","","FWHM; acoustic field; sonication-induced; thermal effects; transcranial focused ultrasound; transducer positioning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An animal prostate tumor model was  developed by implanting human LNCaP tumor cells in the prostates of nude mice.  Tumor-bearing mice were treated with pFUS, RT or both (pFUS + RT) and compared  with a control group. Non-thermal pFUS treatment was delivered by keeping the  body temperature below 42 °C as measured real-time by MR thermometry and using a  pFUS protocol (1 MHz, 25 W focused ultrasound; 1 Hz pulse rate with a 10% duty  cycle for 60 sec for each sonication). Each tumor was covered entirely using 4-8  sonication spots. RT treatment with a dose of 2 Gy was delivered using an  external beam (6 MV photon energy with dose rate 300MU/min). Following the  treatment, mice were scanned weekly with MRI for tumor volume measurement.  RESULTS: The results showed that the tumor volume in the control group increased  exponentially to 142 ± 6%, 205 ± 12%, 286 ± 22% and 410 ± 33% at 1, 2, 3 and  4 weeks after treatment, respectively. In contrast, the pFUS group was 29%  (p < 0.05), 24% (p < 0.05), 8% and 9% smaller, the RT group was 7%, 10%, 12% and  18% smaller, and the pFUS + RT group was 32%, 39%, 41% and 44% (all with  p < 0.05) smaller than the control group at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks post treatment,  respectively. Tumors treated by pFUS showed an early response (i.e. the first  2 weeks), while the RT group showed a late response. The combined pFUS + RT  treatment showed consistent response throughout the post-treatment weeks.  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that RT combined with non-thermal pFUS can  significantly delay the tumor growth. The mechanism of tumor cell killing between  pFUS and RT may be different. Pulsed FUS shows early tumor growth delay, while RT  contributes to the late effect on tumor growth delay. The addition of pFUS to RT  significantly enhanced the therapeutic effect for prostate cancer treatment.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1716-1723","","11","99","","Int J Radiat Biol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37191462","","","","*Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy; Animals; Combined Modality Therapy; Humans; MR image guidance; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Pulsed focused ultrasound; Ultrasonic Waves; prostate cancer in-vivo; radiotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This was a dual-arm study in which each animal (n  = 14) received either a single hepatic microwave (n = 6) or histotripsy (n = 6  single treatment; n = 2 double treatment) under ultrasound guidance. The goal was  to create 2.5-3.0 cm short-axis treatments in similar locations across  modalities. Animals were survived for 1 month with contrast-enhanced CT imaging  on days 0, 2, 7, 14, and 28. On day 28, necropsy and histopathology were  performed. RESULTS: All procedures were well-tolerated. MW ablation zones were  longer and more oblong, but equivalent in the short axes to histotripsy zones on  immediate post-procedure CT (p < 0.001 and p = 0.45, respectively). Overall, MW  volumes were larger (21.4 cm(3) vs. 13.4 cm(3); p = 0.001) and histotripsy  treatment zones were more spherical (p = 0.007). Histotripsy zones were close to  the prescribed size (p < 0.001). Over the study period, histotripsy treatment  zones decreased in volume while microwave ablation zones slightly increased (-83%  vs. +17%, p = 0.001). There were several imaging-only findings: Branch portal  vein thrombus with both histotripsy (7/8) and MW (6/6), hematoma in 2/6 MW only,  and a gallbladder injury in 1/6 MW animals. The ablation zones demonstrated  complete cellular destruction for both modalities. CONCLUSION: Histotripsy was  associated with more spherical treatments, fewer biliary complications, and  greater treatment zone involution. Hepatic MW and histotripsy treatment in a  normal porcine model appear at least equally effective for creating treatment  zones with a similar safety profile. KEY POINTS: • Microwave ablation and  histotripsy for liver treatment in a healthy porcine model yield equivalent  procedural tolerance and cellular destruction. • Histotripsy was associated with  more spherical treatments, fewer biliary complications, and greater treatment  zone involution over the 28-day follow-up period. • These findings confirm the  safety and efficacy of hepatic histotripsy and support the pursuit of clinical  trials to further evaluate the translatability of these results.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1050-1062","","2","33","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical data were  collected from 587 uterine fibroid patients who were treated in The People's  Hospital of Nanchuan, Chongqing from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Among  the patients, 287 cases were treated with HIFU (observation group), and 300 cases  were treated with LM (control group). The progression-free survival (PFS) was  taken as the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints included operation results  (including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and intraoperative fluid  replacement), complications, hemoglobin level one month after surgery and  clinical efficacy. In addition, the fibroid volume of the observation group  before treatment and 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment were also analyzed.  RESULTS: The operative time of observation group was evidently shortened compared  to the control group, and the intraoperative blood loss and intraoperative fluid  replacement of observation group were also considerably reduced (all p < 0.05),  but there was no significant difference in the hemoglobin level between the two  groups one month after surgery (p > 0.05). In terms of curative effect, the total  effective rate of HIFU group and LM group was 98.6% (283/287) and 95.3% (286/300)  respectively, with statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). In terms of  complications, the incidence of bleeding and infection in HIFU group was  obviously lower than that in LM group (both p < 0.05), while no significant  differences were observed in the remaining complications (all p > 0.05). Fibroid  volume comparisons before treatment and 3, 6 and 12 months after operation in  observation group showed that fibroid volume decreased significantly (all p <  0.05). The median follow-up time was 30.6 months. The mean PFS of patients in the  observation group and control group was 29.71 months (95% CI 28.24-29.75) and  26.74 months (95% CI 26.49-28.33), respectively (HR 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.76;  Log-rank p = 0.0019).

METHODS: A  rat intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) model was established by combining FUS and  microbubbles (μBs), and edaravone was used to verify whether the free radical  scavenger had a protective effect on the model. The brain tissue of each group  was sectioned to observe the gross histology, blood-brain barrier (BBB)  permeability, cerebral infarction volume, and histopathological changes. RESULTS:  Compared with the FUS group, the BBB permeability was significantly increased in  the FUS + μBs (F&B) group (p = 0.0021). The second coronal slice in the F&B group  had an obvious hemorrhage lesion, and the FUS + μBs + edaravone (F&B&E) group had  smaller hemorrhage areas; however, ICH did not occur in the FUS group. The  cerebral infarction volume in the F&B group was significantly larger than that in  the FUS group (p = 0.0030) and F&B&E group (p = 0.0208). HE staining results  showed that nerve fibrinolysis, neuronal necrosis, microglia production, and  erythrocytes were found in both the F&B group and the F&B&E group, but the areas  of the nerve fibrinolysis and neuronal necrosis in the F&B group were larger than  the F&B&E group. CONCLUSIONS: A rat ICH model was successfully prepared using the  μBs assisted FUS treatment, and edaravone had a therapeutic effect on this model.  This model can be used to study the pathophysiological mechanism of ICH-related  diseases and in preclinical research on related new drugs.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","103-110","","2","6","","Animal Model Exp Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

Focused ultrasound combined with microbubbles can temporarily open the  intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) of animals and humans, and facilitate drug  delivery. FUS exposure, either with or without microbubbles, has been  demonstrated to alter the behavior of non-human primates, and previous work has  demonstrated transient and long-term effects of FUS neuromodulation on functional  connectivity using resting state functional MRI. However, it is unknown whether  opening the BBB affects functional connectivity differently than FUS alone. Thus  we applied FUS alone (neuromodulation) and FUS with microbubbles (BBB opening) in  the dorsal striatum of lightly anesthetized non-human primates, and compared  changes in functional connectivity in major brain networks. We found different  alteration patterns between FUS neuromodulation and FUS-mediated BBB opening in  several cortical areas, and we also found that applying FUS to a deep brain  structure can alter functional connectivity in the default mode network and  frontotemporal network.","2023-02-16","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: bioRxiv Pages: 2023.02.16.528741 Publication Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology PMID: 36824864  PMCID: PMC9949083","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve effective manipulation within fluidic flow conditions and confined  spaces, it is necessary to consider the physical properties of microparticles and  the types of trapping forces applied. While acoustic waves have shown potential  for manipulating microparticles, the existing setups involve complex actuation  mechanisms and unstable microbubbles. Consequently, the need persists for an  easily deployable acoustic actuation setup with stable microparticles. Here, we  propose the use of hollow borosilicate microparticles possessing a rigid thin  shell, which can be efficiently trapped and manipulated using a single-lens  focused ultrasound (FUS) transducer under physiologically relevant flow  conditions. These hollow microparticles offer stability and advantageous acoustic  properties. They can be scaled up and mass-produced, making them suitable for  systemic delivery. Our research demonstrates the successful trapping dynamics of  FUS within circular tubings of varying diameters, validating the effectiveness of  the method under realistic flow rates and ultrasound amplitudes. We also showcase  the ability to remove hollow microparticles by steering the FUS transducer  against the flow. Furthermore, we present potential biomedical applications, such  as active cell tagging and navigation in bifurcated channels as well as  ultrasound imaging in mouse cadaver liver tissue.","2023-11-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","52224-52236","","45","15","","ACS Appl Mater Interfaces","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37917969  PMCID: PMC10658455","","","","acoustic manipulation; acoustic trapping; focused ultrasound; hollow microparticles; microbubbles; microrobotics; particle manipulation; ultrasound imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Significant  advancements in treatment options for OS have not occurred in the last several  decades, and the prognosis remains grim with only a 70% rate of 5-year survival.  The objective of this study was to investigate the focused ultrasound technique  of histotripsy as a novel, noninvasive treatment option for OS. Methods: We  utilized a heterotopic OS murine model to establish the feasibility of ablating  OS tumors with histotripsy in a preclinical setting. We investigated the local  immune response within the tumor microenvironment (TME) via immune cell  phenotyping and gene expression analysis. Findings: We established the  feasibility of ablating heterotopic OS tumors with ablation characterized  microscopically by loss of cellular architecture in targeted regions of tumors.  We observed greater populations of macrophages and dendritic cells within treated  tumors and the upregulation of immune activating genes 72 h after histotripsy  ablation. Interpretation: This study was the first to investigate histotripsy  ablation for OS in a preclinical murine model, with results suggesting local  immunomodulation within the TME. Our results support the continued investigation  of histotripsy as a novel noninvasive treatment option for OS patients to improve  clinical outcomes and patient prognosis.","2023-10-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","10","11","","Biomedicines","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37893110  PMCID: PMC10604356","","","","DLM8 cell line; focused ultrasound; tumor ablation; tumor immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This systematic  review analyzed available evidence regarding minimally invasive approaches to  fibroid treatment and compared validated QoL and fibroid-associated symptom  scores before and after treatment. A comprehensive search was conducted using  PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus from January 1990 to July 2020.  English-language publications were included if they evaluated associations  between minimally invasive approaches to fibroid treatment and QoL or  fibroid-associated symptoms, and they used validated questionnaires before and  after treatment. QoL or fibroid-associated symptom scores were compared and  summarized for each minimally invasive approach. Thirty-seven studies were  ultimately included in this review: 26 evaluating individual approaches and 11  which were comparative studies of minimally invasive approaches and surgical  interventions. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy  (USGS) significantly improved overall QoL. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) and  ultrasound-guided high-intensity frequency ultrasound (US-HIFU) improved overall  QoL to a similar extent as surgical interventions. Twenty-eight studies assessed  fibroid-associated symptoms with the Uterine Fibroid Symptoms Quality of Life  Questionnaire (UFS-QoL). UAE, magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity  frequency ultrasound (MR-HIFU), US-HIFU, RFA, and percutaneous microwave ablation  (PMWA) significantly decreased Symptom Severity Score by a range of 21 to 39  points (out of 100) at 6 months. Minimally invasive approaches to treat fibroids  were effective alternatives to surgical interventions for improving quality of  life, fibroid-associated symptoms, and pain. Outcomes among minimally invasive  approaches were similar, presenting patients with numerous options for fibroid  treatment.","2023-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1495-1505","","5","30","","Reprod Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen  female domestic swine were divided evenly into histotripsy and cryoablation  treatment arms. A planned 2-3 cm diameter treatment was performed under  ultrasound (histotripsy) or ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) guidance  (cryoablation). Contrast-enhanced CT and serum blood analysis were performed  immediately postprocedure and on day 7, with either immediate killing (n = 3) or  continued survival to day 30 (n = 6), at which time contrast-enhanced CT, serum  blood analysis, and necropsy were performed. Animal welfare, treatment zone  appearance, procedure-related adverse events, and histopathology of the treatment  zones and surrounding tissues were assessed. RESULTS: Histotripsy treatment zones  (mean ±standard deviation diameters, 2.7 ± 0.12 × 2.4 ± 0.19 × 2.4 ± 0.26 cm;  volume, 8.3 ± 1.9 cm(3)) were larger than cryoablation zones (mean diameters, 2.2  ± 0.19 × 1.9 ± 0.13 × 1.7 ± 0.19 cm; volume, 3.9 ± 0.8 cm(3); P < .001). At 30  days, histotripsy and cryoablation treatment zone volumes decreased by 96% and  83% on CT, respectively (P < .001). Perirenal hematomas were present after 8 of 9  (89%) cryoablation (mean volume, 22.2 cm(3)) and 1 of 9 (11%, P < .001)  histotripsy (volume, 0.4 cm(3)) procedures, with active arterial extravasation in  4 of 9 (44%) cryoablation and no histotripsy animals (P = .206).

Uterine fibroids (UF) are the most common benign neoplasms of  the uterus, and increased diversity in vaginal microbial of UF patients.  High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is effective invasive treatment for  fibroids in women who are not good surgical candidates. Whether HIFU of uterine  fibroids will cause the change in vaginal microbiota has not been reported. We  aimed to investigate the vaginal microbiota of UF patients with/without HIFU  treatment using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. METHODS: Vaginal secretions were  collected from 77 UF patients (pre-operative and post-operative) and were used  for comparative composition, diversity, and richness analyses of microbial  communities. RESULTS: The microbial α-diversity was significantly lower in the  vaginal of UF patients with HIFU treatment. The relative abundance of some  pathogenic bacteria of UF patients with HIFU treatment were significantly  decreased in the bacterial phylum and genus level. Proteobacteria were found to  be significantly upregulated as a biomarker in the HIFU treatment group in our  study. CONCLUSION: These findings might confirm the effectiveness of HIFU  treatment from the point of view of microbiota.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1138962","","","14","","Front Microbiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Zhang, He, Tang, Chen and Han.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37138604  PMCID: PMC10150040","","","","16SrRNA sequencing; diversity; high-intensity focused ultrasound; uterine fibroids; vaginal microbiota","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We searched for original research studies  evaluating MRgFUS therapy in UFs with outcomes containing AEs and/or  complications in different databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, COCHRANE) until  March 2022. Reviews, editorials, opinions or letters, case studies, conference  papers and abstracts were excluded from the analysis. The systematic literature  search identified 446 articles, 43 of which were analyzed. RESULTS: According to  available evidence, the overall incidence of serious complications in MRgFUS  therapy is relatively low. No AEs/complications were reported in 11 out of 43  analyzed studies. The mean occurrence of all AEs in the analyzed material was  24.67%. The most commonly described AEs included pain, skin burns, urinary tract  infections and sciatic neuropraxia. Major AEs, such as skin ulcerations or deep  vein thrombosis, occurred in 0.41% of cases in the analyzed material. CONCLUSION:  MRgFUS seems to be safe in UF therapy. The occurrence of AEs, especially major  ones, is relatively low in comparison with other methods. The new devices and  more experience of their users seem to reduce AE rate. The lack of unification in  AE reporting and missing data are the main issues in this area. More prospective,  randomized studies with unified reporting and long follow-up are needed to  determine the safety in a long-term perspective.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2174274","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36775655","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/adverse effects/methods; *Leiomyoma/diagnostic imaging/therapy; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Interventional/methods; *Uterine Neoplasms; Female; Humans; MR-HIFU; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; adverse event; complication; uterine fibroid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For accurate localization of  the target and safe control of the HIFU dosage, real-time imaging guidance during  the HIFU exposure is desired. Ultrasound imaging has the capability to guide  clinicians toward a lesion in real time, but is not an ideal option, as HIFU  application causes strong interference, thereby substantially distorting the  images used for guidance. Thus, this study introduces singular value  decomposition-based filtering capable of restoring ultrasound harmonic images  from HIFU interference without undesirable spectral distortion.

A well-known and popular  equation often used for calculating ARF in elastography is in conflict with the  equation commonly employed for calculating ARF for determining acoustic power in  radiation force balances (RFBs). Controversies have sparked debate for over a  century concerning the physical mechanisms underlying ARFs. For over four  decades, the science of ultrasound exposimetry has steadily improved and has  provided clues in terms of accumulated data about the characteristics of  transmitted ultrasound fields. Concurrently, the availability and capability of  predicting these fields have improved significantly. The author draws on these  sources to re-examine the physical principles behind ARFs. Conflicts are shown to  stem from idealized configurations and simplistic assumptions. By more fully  accounting for the pulse shape and spectrum, the effect of frequency power law  attenuation, diffraction, and nonlinearity, more accurate equations are developed  for ARFs for practical applications which are more consistent with exposimetry  observations. Simulations compare well to corrected 1.5 MHz RFB data. While some  questions await resolution, the approach presented here settles several  longstanding conflicts and provides a new broadband framework for future ARF  work.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","128-137","","2","70","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36215338","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PURPOSE: Here, a new  bubble sonoablation technique was investigated using low-pressure FUS in  combination with local injection of perfluoropentane (PFP) in rabbit liver.  METHODS: Fifteen healthy New Zealand white rabbits were treated with FUS alone,  FUS + PFP or PFP alone. FUS was performed using a single-element focused  transducer (frequency 596 kHz, 0.27 ms pulses, 0.54% duty cycle, and peak  negative pressure 2.0 MPa). Ten minutes before FUS treatment, the PFP droplet was  locally injected into the rabbit liver, where the ultrasound was focused.  Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of the liver was performed, and the  temperature at the liver surface in the targeted liver region was recorded during  treatment. The livers were collected for pathological examination. Statistical  significance was set at p < 0.05. Paired t-tests were used to compare the pre-  and post-treatment values. One-way analysis of variance was performed to compare  multiple groups, and the least significant difference method was used for further  comparisons between the two groups. RESULTS: Analysis of CEUS data showed that  the values of area under the curve (AUC) were significantly different in the PFP  + FUS group pre- (10453.644 ± 1182.93) and post-treatment (4058.098 ± 2720.41),  and the AUC values of PFP + FUS post-treatment (4058.098 ± 2720.41) were also  significantly lower than those of the FUS (9946.694 ± 1071.54) and the PFP  (10364.794 ± 2181.53) groups. The peak intensity values also showed the same  results, the value of peak intensity of PFP+FUS post-treatment was  82.958 ± 13.99, whereas there was no difference between FUS (106.61 ± 7.61) and  PFP (104.136 ± 10.55). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed that the  pathological damage ratings of the PFP + FUS, PFP, and FUS groups were grade 3,  grade 1, and grade 0, respectively. Specifically, the area of liver necrosis in  the PFP + FUS group (0.99 ± 0.29 cm(2) ) was 198 times higher than that in the  PFP group (0.005 ± 0.008 cm(2) ), whereas no necrosis was observed in the livers  treated with FUS alone. Simultaneously, the number of vacuoles in the liver of  the PFP + FUS group (35.50 ± 23.31) was approximately five times that of the PFP  group (7.00 ± 12.88), whereas no vacuoles were found in the liver treated with  FUS alone.

Although histotripsy targeting is currently based on  ultrasound (US), other imaging modalities such as cone-beam computed tomography  (CBCT) have recently been proposed to enable the treatment of tumors not visible  on ultrasound. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a  multi-modality phantom to facilitate the assessment of histotripsy treatment  zones on both US and CBCT imaging. METHODS: Fifteen red blood cell phantoms  composed of alternating layers with and without barium were manufactured.  Spherical 25-mm histotripsy treatments were performed, and treatment zone size  and location were measured on CBCT and ultrasound. Sound speed, impedance and  attenuation were measured for each layer type. RESULTS: The average ± standard  deviation signed difference between measured treatment diameters was 0.29 ± 1.25  mm. The Euclidean distance between measured treatment centers was 1.68 ± 0.63 mm.  The sound speed in the different layers ranged from 1491 to 1514 m/s and was  within typically reported soft tissue ranges (1480-1560 m/s). In all phantoms,  histotripsy resulted in sharply delineated treatment zones, allowing segmentation  in both modalities. CONCLUSION: These phantoms will aid in the development and  validation of X-ray-based histotripsy targeting techniques, which promise to  expand the scope of treatable lesions beyond only those visible on ultrasound.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1401-1407","","6","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Brain tumors present multiple obstacles that make therapeutic innovation complex,  mainly due to the presence of blood-tumor and blood-brain barriers (BTB and BBB,  respectively) which prevent penetration of anticancer agents into the brain  parenchyma. Focused ultrasound-mediated BBB disruption (FUS-BBBD) provides a  physical method for non-invasive, local, and reversible BBB disruption. The  safety of this technique has been demonstrated in small and large animal models.  This approach promises to enhance drug delivery into the brain tumor and  therefore to improve survival outcomes by repurposing existing drugs.

Conventionally, in HMI, a focused ultrasound (FUS) transducer  generates oscillatory tissue displacements, and an imaging transducer acquires  channel data for displacement estimation, with each transducer being driven with  a separate system. The fixed position of the FUS focal spot requires mechanical  translation of the transducers, which can be a time-consuming and challenging  procedure. In this study, we developed and characterized a new HMI system with a  multi-element FUS transducer with the capability of electronic focal steering of  ±5 mm and ±2 mm from the geometric focus in the axial and lateral directions,  respectively. A pulse sequence was developed to drive both the FUS and imaging  transducers using a single ultrasound data acquisition (DAQ) system. The setup  was validated on a tissue-mimicking phantom with embedded inclusions. Integrating  beam steering with the mechanical translation of the transducers resulted in a  consistent high contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the inclusions with Young's  moduli of 22 and 44 kPa within a 5-kPa background while the data acquisition  speed is increased by 4.5-5.2-fold compared to the case when only mechanical  movements were applied. The feasibility of simultaneous generation of multiple  foci and tracking the induced displacements is demonstrated in phantoms for  applications where imaging or treatment of a larger region is needed. Moreover,  preliminary feasibility is shown in a human subject with a breast tumor, where  the mean HMI displacement within the tumor was about 4 times lower than that  within perilesional tissues. The proposed HMI system facilitates data acquisition  in terms of flexibility and speed and can be potentially used in the clinic for  breast cancer imaging and treatment.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1150-1161","","4","70","","IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36191094  PMCID: PMC10067540","","","","*Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Elastic Modulus; Elasticity; Electronics; Humans; Movement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims  to overcome this by combining therapy and imaging guidance with one single HIFU  transducer using the vibro-acoustography (VA) strategy. METHODS: Based on the VA  imaging method, a HIFU transducer consisting of 8 transmitting elements was  proposed for therapy planning, treatment and evaluation. Inherent registration  between the therapy and imaging created unique spatial consistence in HIFU  transducer's focal region in the above three procedures. Performance of this  imaging modality was first evaluated through in-vitro phantoms. In-vitro and  ex-vivo experiments were then designed to demonstrate the proposed dual-mode  system's ability in conducting accurate thermal ablation. RESULTS: Point spread  function of the HIFU-converted imaging system had a full wave half maximum of  about 1.2 mm in both directions at a transmitting frequency of 1.2 MHz, which  outperformed the conventional ultrasound imaging (3.15 MHz) in in-vitro  situation. Image contrast was also tested on the in-vitro phantom. Various  geometric patterns could be accurately 'burned out' on the testing objects by the  proposed system both in vitro and ex vivo. CONCLUSION: Implementation of imaging  and therapy with one HIFU transducer in this manner is feasible and it has  potential as a novel strategy for addressing the long-standing problem in the  HIFU therapy, possibly pushing this non-invasive technique forward towards wider  clinical applications.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","3413-3424","","12","70","","IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37339046","","","","*Elasticity Imaging Techniques; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; Phantoms, Imaging; Transducers; Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the past two decades, new technologies and BC screening have led to the diagnosis  of smaller and earlier-stage BC (ESBC). Therefore, percutaneous minimally  invasive techniques (PMIT) were adopted to treat patients unfit for surgery,  women who refuse it, or elderly patients with comorbidities that could make  surgery a difficult and life-threatening treatment. The target of PMIT is  small-size ESBC with the scope of obtaining similar efficacy as surgery.  Minimally invasive treatments are convenient alternatives with promising  effectiveness, lower morbidity, less cost, less scarring and pain, and more  satisfying cosmetic results. Ablative techniques used in BC are cryoablation,  radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound  (US), and laser ablation. The aim of our study is to discuss the current status  of percutaneous management of BC, evaluate the clinical outcomes of PMIT in BC,  and analyze future perspectives regarding ablation therapy in BC.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","15330338231157193","","","22","","Technol Cancer Res Treat","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36916200  PMCID: PMC10017926","","","","*Ablation Techniques/methods; *Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/surgery; *Catheter Ablation/methods; *Cryosurgery/methods; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Laser Therapy/methods; Aged; Female; Humans; breast cancer; cryoablation; early stage breast cancer; high intensity focused ultrasound; laser ablation; microwave ablation; minimally invasive ablation; radiofrequency ablation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The oncologic effectiveness and morbidity of Radical  Prostatectomy (RP) and radiotherapy have been broadly validated. Focal therapies  pursue to reduce the morbidity observed after radical treatments, while  preserving the oncologic effectiveness. This study aims to review the  state-of-the-art about principles, oncologic effectiveness, morbidity, and  side-effects associated with leading focal therapies. We review and summarize  articles related with Cryotherapy, High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound (HIFU),  Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), and Irreversible Electroporating (IRE) published in  MEDLINE from 2000 to 2022. There is a wide heterogeneity in terms of the  measurement of effectiveness and morbidity. Hence, comparing different energies,  strategies and protocols seem to be unprecise and controversial. Cryosurgery and  HIFU have reported more clinical experience than PDT and IRE. Biochemical  recurrence rate after the first session varied from 4.5% to 23%, and up to 20% of  patients underwent a salvage radical treatment. The reported incidence of  erectile disfunction and urinary incontinence ranges from 3% to 50% and 0% to  34%, respectively. None randomized clinical trial comparing any focal therapy to  any radical treatment has been published. We conclude that the expansion of focal  therapies requires the consolidation of MRI-guided fusion biopsies in everyday  clinical practice. Short-term oncologic effectiveness has been proved and  supports their usefulness in low-risk patients unfit for surgical treatment.  However, long-term effects and the clinical experience in intermediate and  high-risk patients remains limited. Currently none of the focal therapies can be  considered the Gold Standard for low-risk patients.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","712.e1-712.e8","","6","21","","Clin Genitourin Cancer","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

In  physiologic states, the blood-brain barrier serves a protective role by passively  and actively excluding neurotoxic compounds; however, this functionality limits  the penetrance of therapeutics into the tumor microenvironment. Focused  ultrasound technology provides a method for overcoming the blood-brain and  blood-tumor barriers through ultrasound frequency to transiently permeabilize or  disrupt these barriers. Concomitant delivery of therapeutics has allowed for  previously impermeable agents to reach the tumor microenvironment. This review  details the advances in focused ultrasound in both preclinical models and  clinical studies, with a focus on its safety profile. We then turn towards future  directions in focused ultrasound-mediated therapies for brain tumors.","2023-05-29","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1094-1109","","3","9","","Tomography","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37368542  PMCID: PMC10301958","","","","*Brain Neoplasms/therapy/drug therapy; Blood-Brain Barrier/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Tumor Microenvironment; Ultrasonography; blood–brain barrier; blood–tumor barrier; chemotherapy; glioma; immunotherapy; microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the ability to focus  is limited by phase aberration, or decorrelation of the ultrasound pulses due to  spatial variation in the speed of sound throughout heterogeneous tissue. Phase  aberration shifts, broadens, and weakens the focus, thereby reducing the safety  and efficacy of histotripsy therapy. This paper reviews and discusses aberration  effects in histotripsy and in related therapeutic ultrasound techniques (e.g.,  high intensity focused ultrasound), with an emphasis on aberration by soft  tissues. Methods for aberration correction are reviewed and can be classified  into two groups: model-based methods, which use segmented images of the tissue as  input to an acoustic propagation model to predict and compensate phase  differences, and signal-based methods, which use a receive-capable therapy array  to detect phase differences by sensing acoustic signals backpropagating from the  focus. The relative advantages and disadvantages of both groups of methods are  discussed. Importantly, model-based methods can correct focal shift, while  signal-based methods can restore substantial focal pressure, suggesting that both  methods should be combined in a 2-step approach. Aberration correction will be  critical to improving histotripsy treatments and expanding the histotripsy  treatment envelope to enable non-invasive, non-thermal histotripsy therapy for  more patients.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2266594","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37813397  PMCID: PMC10637766","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; Histotripsy; Humans; Microbubbles; Phantoms, Imaging; Sound; Ultrasonography; aberration correction; cavitation; focusing; high intensity focused ultrasound; phase; phase correction; soft tissue; therapeutic ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
