For acute proximal deep vein thrombosis, catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy is an  accepted method for vessel recanalization. Thrombolytic therapy is not without  risk, including the potential for hemorrhagic bleeding that increases with lytic  dose. Histotripsy is a focused ultrasound therapy that generates bubble clouds  spontaneously in tissue at depth. The mechanical activity of histotripsy  increases the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy at doses consistent with current  pharmacomechanical treatments for venous thrombosis. The objective of this study  was to determine the influence of lytic dose on histotripsy-enhanced  fibrinolysis. Human whole blood clots formed in vitro were exposed to histotripsy  and a thrombolytic agent (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA) in a  venous flow model perfused with plasma. Lytic was administered into the clot via  an infusion catheter at concentrations ranging from 0 (control) to 4.54 μg/mL (a  common clinical dose for catheter-directed thrombolysis). Following treatment,  perfusate samples were assayed for markers of fibrinolysis, hemolysis, and intact  red blood cells and platelets. Fibrinolysis was equivalent between the common  clinical dose of rt-PA (4.54 μg/mL) and rt-PA at a reduction to one-twentieth of  the common clinical dose (0.23 μg/mL) when combined with histotripsy. Minimal  changes were observed in hemolysis for treatment arms with or without  histotripsy, potentially due to clot damage from insertion of the infusion  catheter. Likewise, histotripsy did not increase the concentration of red blood  cells or platelets in the perfusate following treatment compared to rt-PA alone.  At the highest lytic dose, a refined histotripsy exposure scheme was implemented  to cover larger areas of the clot. The updated exposure scheme improved clot mass  loss and fibrinolysis relative to administration of lytic alone. Overall, the  data collected in this study indicate the rt-PA dose can be reduced by more than  a factor of ten and still promote fibrinolysis when combined with histotripsy.","2022","2024-03-06 17:11:49","2024-03-06T17:11:49Z","","e0261567","","1","17","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 34982784  PMCID: PMC8726487","","","","Blood Platelets/chemistry; Catheters; Erythrocytes/chemistry; Fibrinolysis/*drug effects; Fibrinolytic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Hemoglobins/chemistry; Humans; In Vitro Techniques; Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Thrombolytic Therapy/*methods; Tissue Plasminogen Activator/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Venous Thrombosis/drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND  METHODS: A total of 91 patients were divided into groups based on non-perfused  volume (NPV) ratio and blood supply type. The preoperative MRI parameters were  measured and analysed. A correlation analysis between the MRI parameters and the  NPV ratio was performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used  to analyse and determine the cut-off value of MRI parameters to predict the  ablation rate of fibroids. RESULTS: The uterine fibroids group with an NPV ratio  <80% and the group with an NPV ratio of ≥80% had significant differences in  signal intensity (SI) at MRI T2-weighted imaging (WI), fibroid-to-rectus  abdominis SI ratio (SIR) at T2WI, and blood supply type (p<0.05). There were no  significant differences in fibroid volume, T2WI signal uniformity, and apparent  diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. The ADC value and SI and SIR at MRI T2WI in  the group with poor blood supply were lower than those in the group with a rich  blood supply (p<0.05). SI at MRI T2WI correlated negatively with the NPV ratio.  The cut-off values for SI and SIR at MRI T2WI of fibroids whose NPV ratio exceeds  80% were 220.58 and 1.315, respectively. CONCLUSION: SI at MRI T2WI and blood  supply type could be predictors of the efficacy of ablation. Ultrasonic ablation  of fibroids with MRI T2WI hyperintensity and a rich blood supply had poor  efficacy.","2023-01","2024-03-06 17:11:43","2024-03-06T17:11:43Z","","61-69","","1","78","","Clin Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Royal College of Radiologists.

Musculoskeletal tumoral diseases would definitely benefit from a low-invasive approach that could reduce mortality and morbidity in particular. Thermal ablation through IR has already become important in the palliation and consolidation of bone metastases, oligometastatic disease, local recurrences, and treating specific benign tumors, with a more tailored approach, considering the characteristics of every patient. As image-guided ablation techniques lower their invasiveness and increase their efficacy while the collateral effects and complications decrease, they become more relevant and need to be considered in patient care pathways and clinical management, to improve outcomes.

This study reports the development of a two-step technology  for low-energy mechanical ultrasound surgery of tissues using nanodroplets to  reduce the pressure threshold. Step 1 consists of vaporizing the nanodroplets  into gaseous microbubbles via megahertz ultrasound excitation. Then,  low-frequency ultrasound is applied to the microbubbles, which turns them into  therapeutic warheads that trigger potent mechanical effects in the surrounding  tissue. The use of nanoscale nanodroplets coupled with low-frequency ultrasound  reduces the pressure threshold required for mechanical ultrasound surgery by an  order of magnitude. In addition, their average diameter of 300 nm can overcome  challenges associated with the size of microbubbles. Optimization experiments  were performed to determine the ultrasound parameters for nanodroplet  vaporization and the subsequent microbubble implosion processes. Optimal  vaporization was obtained when transmitting a 2-cycle excitation pulse at a  center frequency of 5 MHz and a peak negative pressure of 4.1 MPa (mechanical  index = 1.8). Low-frequency insonation of the generated microbubbles at a center  frequency of 850, 250 or 80 kHz caused enhanced contrast reduction at a center  frequency of 80 kHz, compared with the other frequencies, while operating at the  same mechanical index of 0.9. Nanodroplet-mediated insonation of ex vivo chicken  liver samples generated mechanical damage. Low-frequency treatment at a  mechanical index of 0.9 and a center frequency of 80 kHz induced the largest  lesion area (average of 0.59 mm(2)) compared with 250- and 850-kHz treatments  with the same mechanical index (average lesions areas of 0.29 and 0.19 mm(2),  respectively, p < 0.001). The two-step approach makes it possible to conduct both  the vaporization and implosion stages at mechanical indices below 1.9, thus  avoiding undesired mechanical damage. The findings indicate that coupled with  low-frequency ultrasound, nanodroplets can be used for low-energy mechanical  ultrasound surgery.","2022-07","2024-03-06 17:11:37","2024-03-06T17:11:37Z","","1229-1239","","7","48","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Towards this  aim, functional and structural neuroimaging and extensive clinical data from  thirty-five PD patients enrolled in a double-blind tcMRgFUS-subthalamotomy  clinical trial were analyzed. A multivariate cross-correlation analysis revealed  that the baseline multimodal imaging data significantly explain (P < 0.005,  FWE-corrected) the inter-individual variability in response to treatment. Most  predictive features at baseline included neural fluctuations in distributed  cortical regions and structural integrity in the putamen and parietal regions.  Additionally, a similar multivariate analysis showed that the population variance  in clinical improvements is significantly explained (P < 0.001, FWE-corrected) by  a distributed network of concurrent functional and structural brain changes in  frontotemporal, parietal, occipital, and cerebellar regions, as opposed to local  changes in very specific brain regions.

Identifying the impact of endogenous  neural activity on neuromodulation outcome is critical to harnessing the  potential of tFUS. OBJECTIVE: Here we sought to identify the relationship between  pre-stimulation neural activity and the neuronal response to tFUS. METHODS: We  applied 3 min of continuous-wave tFUS to the hippocampal region of the rat while  recording local field potentials (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) from the  target. We also tested the application of tFUS but with an air gap separating the  transducer and the skull, as well as active stimulation of the contralateral  olfactory bulb. RESULTS: We observed a modest but significant increase in firing  rate during hippocampal tFUS, but not during stimulation of the olfactory bulb or  when an air gap was present. Importantly, the observed firing rate increase was  significantly modulated by the power of baseline oscillations in the LFP, with  low levels of delta (1-3 Hz) and high levels of theta (4-10 Hz) and gamma  (30-250 Hz) power producing significantly larger firing rate increases. Firing  rate increases were also amplified by a factor of 7× when stimulation was applied  during periods of frequent sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity.

The ability of FUS to stimulate the nervous  system, in a noninvasive and spatiotemporally precise manner, has been  demonstrated in animals and human subjects, but the underlying biomechanisms are  not fully understood yet. The objective of the present study was to investigate  the bioeffects involved in the generation of trains of action potentials (APs) by  repetitive-pulse FUS stimuli in a simple invertebrate neural model. METHODS: The  respective influences of different acoustic parameters on the neurostimulation  success rate (NSR), defined as the rate of FUS stimuli capable of evoking at  least one AP, were explored using the system of afferent nerves and giant fibers  of Lumbricus terrestris as neural model. Each parameter was studied independently  by administering random FUS sequences while keeping all but one FUS parameter  constant. The NSR was evaluated as a function of (i) the spatial-average  pulse-average intensity (I(sapa) ); (ii) the pulse duration (PD); (iii) the pulse  repetition frequency (PRF); iv) the number of cycles per pulse (N(cycles) ); (v)  two ultrasound frequencies, f(0)  = 1.1 MHz and f(3)  = 3.3 MHz, corresponding to  the fundamental and third-harmonic resonant frequencies of the FUS transducer,  respectively (spherical, radius of curvature: 50 mm); and (vi) levels of emerging  stable cavitation and inertial cavitation. RESULTS: The NSR associated to 1.1 MHz  repetitive-pulse FUS stimuli was found to increase as a function of increasing  I(sapa) , PD, PRF, and N(cycles) . When evaluating each parameter at f = 1.1 MHz,  it was observed that NSRs close to 100% were achieved when sufficiently elevating  their respective values. When computing the NSR as a function of the  spatial-average, temporal-average intensity (I(sata) ), defined as the product of  PRF, PD, and I(sapa) , a significant elevation of the NSR from 0% to close to  100% was measured by increasing I(sata) from values approximate to 4 W/cm(2) to  values higher than 12 W/cm(2) . No clear and consistent trend was observed in  trials aimed at exploring the effects of different levels of stable and inertial  acoustic cavitation on the NSR. Finally, the feasibility of inducing neural  responses with 3.3 MHz repetitive-pulse FUS stimuli was also demonstrated with  NSRs reaching up to 60%, in the range of FUS parameters studied. CONCLUSION: The  time-averaged value of the radiation force per unit volume of tissue is  proportional to the acoustic intensity. As a result, the observations from this  study suggest that the neural structure responding to the stimulus is sensitive  to the mean radiation force carried by the FUS sequence, regardless of the  combination of FUS parameters giving rise to such force. The results from this  study further revealed the existence of a minimal activation threshold with  regard to I(sapa) .","2022-01","2024-03-06 17:11:29","2024-03-06T17:11:29Z","","682-701","","1","49","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34796512","","","","*Acoustics; *Axons; Animals; Humans; NSR optimization; Sound; Transducers; Ultrasonography; causal neurostimulation; in vivo giant axon; parametric study; repetitive FUS pulses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So far,  experimental protocols are verifying the clinical extension to other facets of  the movement disorder galaxy (i.e., internal pallidus for disabling dyskinesias).  Aside from those neurosurgical options, one of the most intriguing opportunities  of this technique relies on its capability to remedy the impermeability of  blood-brain barrier (BBB). Temporary BBB opening through low-intensity focused  ultrasound turned out to be safe and feasible in patients with PD, Alzheimer's  disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. As a mere consequence of the  procedures, some groups described even reversible but significant mild cognitive  amelioration, up to hippocampal neurogenesis partially associated to the  increased of endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). A further  development elevates MRgFUS to the status of therapeutic tool for drug delivery  of putative neurorestorative therapies. Since 2012, FUS-assisted intravenous  administration of BDNF or neurturin allowed hippocampal or striatal delivery.  Experimental studies emphasized synergistic modalities. In a rodent model for  Huntington's disease, engineered liposomes can carry glial cell line-derived  neurotrophic factor (GDNF) plasmid DNA (GDNFp) to form a GDNFp-liposome  (GDNFp-LPs) complex through pulsed FUS exposures with microbubbles; in a subacute  MPTP-PD model, the combination of intravenous administration of neurotrophic  factors (either through protein or gene delivery) plus FUS did curb nigrostriatal  degeneration. Here, we explore these arguments, focusing on the current,  translational application of neurotrophins in neurodegenerative diseases.","2022","2024-03-06 17:11:28","2024-03-06T17:11:28Z","","846681","","","16","","Front Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Stefani, Pierantozzi, Cardarelli, Stefani, Cerroni, Conti, Garasto, Mercuri, Marini and Sucapane.","","","","","","PMID: 35401084  PMCID: PMC8990810","","","","BBB; MRgFUS; movement disorders; neurodegeneration; neurotrophins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Low-intensity ultrasound transmission by a  single-element transducer is mostly established for neuromodulation applications  and blood-brain barrier disruption for drug delivery. However, transducer  positioning errors can occur without fine control over the sonication, which can  affect repeatability and lead to reliability problems. The objective of this  study was to determine whether the target brain region would be stable under  small displacement (0.5 mm) of the transducer based on numerical simulations.  Computed-tomography-derived three-dimensional models of a rat head were  constructed to investigate the effects of transducer displacement in the caudate  putamen (CP) and thalamus (TH). Using three different frequencies (1.1, 0.69, and  0.25 MHz), the transducer was displaced by 0.5 mm in each of the following six  directions: superior, interior, anterior, posterior, left, and right. The maximum  value of the intracranial pressure field was calculated, and the targeting errors  were determined by the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) overlap between the free  water space (FWHM(water)) and transcranial transmission (FWHM(base)). When the  transducer was positioned directly above the target region, a clear distinction  between the target regions was observed, resulting in 88.3%, 81.5%, and 84.5%  FWHM(water) for the CP and 65.6%, 76.3%, and 64.4% FWHM(water) for the TH at 1.1,  0.69, and 0.25 MHz, respectively. Small transducer displacements induced both  enhancement and reduction of the peak pressure and targeting errors, compared  with when the transducer was displaced in water. Small transducer displacement to  the left resulted in the lowest stability, with 34.8% and 55.0% targeting  accuracy (FWHM(water)) at 1.1 and 0.69 MHz in the TH, respectively. In addition,  the maximum pressure was reduced by up to 11% by the transducer displacement.

The objective of this study is to  numerically investigate the ultrasound wave propagation and the energy  distribution within the brain tissues using customized single element focused  ultrasound transducers (SEFT), targeting the hippocampus. METHODS: A high  resolution detailed human head model with seven tissue types was constructed from  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A full-wave finite-difference time-domain  simulation platform, Sim4life, was then used to simulate a 3D non-linear  ultrasound wave equation to the specific region of interest, the hippocampus.  Three customized SEFT were used to test the effect of transducer positions, and  another customized transducer was used to compare the sensitivity effect on  heterogeneous and homogeneous brain models. Finally, the sensitivity and  performance of low intensity focusing ultrasound stimulation were evaluated.  RESULTS: An optimized application of SEFT was customized to deliver 100 W/m(2)  intensity of energy deposition at the hippocampus region. About 85.65% of the  generated volume beam was delivered to the targeted hippocampus region and the  beam overlap parameter was affected by different transducer positions. Deflection  angle changes of SEFT at the range of ± 5% did not have a significant effect on  energy delivery and position displacement. Only 0.5% of peak pressure change was  observed between heterogeneous and homogeneous brain models. The sensitivity  analysis also showed that the sound speed is the most influential acoustic  parameter. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrated that ultrasound neuromodulation  targeting the depth brain tissue of the hippocampus could be a potential and  promising alternative method to some non-acoustic brain stimulation modalities.  In the numerical study of ultrasound brain stimulations, ultrasound parameters  and the brain model need to be properly determined to simulate the ultrasonic  neuromodulations.","2022-03-12","2024-03-06 17:11:19","2024-03-06T17:11:19Z","","106724","","","124","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

It has also been  demonstrated that triggering droplets before HIFU exposure could be a potential  way to control both the size and the shape of the thermal lesion. In this paper,  a numerical model is proposed to predict the thermal lesion created in ADV  enhanced HIFU treatment. Bubble oscillation was coupled into a viscoelastic  medium in the model to more closely represent real applications in tissues.  Several physical processes caused by continuous wave ultrasound and elevated  temperature during the HIFU exposure were considered, including rectified  diffusion, gas solubility variation with temperature in the medium, and boiling.  Four droplet concentrations spanning two orders of magnitude were calculated. The  bubble cloud formed from triggering of the droplets by the pulse wave ultrasound,  along with the evolution of the shape and location of the bubble cloud and  thermal lesion during the following continuous wave exposure was obtained. The  increase of bubble void fraction caused by continuous wave exposure was found to  be consistent with the experimental observation. With the increase of droplet  concentration, the predicted bubble cloud shapes vary from tadpole to triangular  and double triangular, while the thermal lesions move toward the transducer. The  results show that the assumptions used in this model increased the accuracy of  the results. This model may be used for parametrical study of ADV enhanced HIFU  treatment and be further used for treatment planning and optimization in the  future.","2022-03-01","2024-03-06 17:11:18","2024-03-06T17:11:18Z","","031007","","3","144","","J Biomech Eng","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 by ASME.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34505142","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Microbubbles; Acoustics; Transducers; Volatilization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simulations that employ a numerical propagator matrix and a Semi-Analytical  approach establish the transcranial dispersion characteristics and transmission  coefficients at different incident angles. Experimental transmission tests  conducted at 500 kHz and radiation tests performed in the 200-800 kHz range  confirm the numerical findings in terms of transmitted peak pressure and  frequency-radiation angle spectra, based on which the connection between critical  angles, dispersion and transmission is demonstrated. Our results support the  identification of transcranial ultrasound strategies that leverage shear mode  conversion, which is less sensitive to phase aberrations compared to normal  incidence ultrasound.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective  analysis for the 163 patients who treated by PGA for clinically unilateral  prostate cancer. The PGA was performed using Focal one system with concurrent  trans-urethral prostatectomy. The oncological and functional outcomes were  evaluated as well as risk factors for remnant disease after PGA. Clinically  significant cancer was defined as grade group ≥2. RESULTS: Among the entire  subjects, grade group 2 or greater was present at pre-treatment biopsy in 76.7%.  Median follow-up time was 17 months and 60.1% of total subjects had follow-up  biopsy at postoperative 1 year. There were 25 subjects (24.2%) with any cancer  and 13 subjects (12.6%) with CS cancer at the follow-up biopsy. The preoperative  age and number of positive cores at preoperative biopsy were significantly  associated with positive results at follow-up biopsy. Incontinence which requires  2 or more pads per day was observed at 4 subjects (2.5%) postoperatively. There  were no subjects who needed intensive care or experienced rectal complications.  CONCLUSION: The PGA with HIFU was safe and showed good preservation of functional  outcomes as well as satisfactory oncological control. The remnant disease was  observed in the 24.5% of patients who underwent follow-up biopsy in the present  study.

Therefore, for having a successful treatment, the physical problem  requires to know several properties due to the high variability from individual  to individual, or even for the same individual under different physiological  conditions. This article presents a numerical simulation of hyperthermia therapy  for cancer treatment using HIFU, as well as the estimation of parameters that  influence the physical problem.

Penetrating electrodes (e.g., microwires and silicon  probes) for DBS provide high spatial resolution, but are invasive, displacing  neural tissue, producing acute insertion trauma, and potentially eliciting a  foreign-body response. Surface electrodes, while less invasive, cannot generate a  highly localized electrical field. Motivated by these limitations, the goal of  this chapter is to provide a protocol to run patch clamp experiments on rat brain  slices with a focused ultrasonic transducer that offers minimally invasive and  highly localized neuronal stimulation (and that is thin enough to let light to  pass through for optical observation of neuron cells for patching). Though  focused acoustic beams with high energy are traditionally used for cellular  ablation, the goal here is to use low acoustic energy to avoid any ablation or  lesion, exploiting the unprecedented features of self-focusing acoustic  transducers (SFATs) that can focus 2-20 MHz sound waves at a submillimeter-sized  area. The experimental procedures described here will allow intracellular and  extracellular experiments to determine the value and underlying mechanisms of  neuromodulation effects induced by SFAT-based ultrasonic stimulation. The aims of  this protocol are (1) to fabricate SFATs for the proposed intracellular and  extracellular experiments and (2) to characterize the neuromodulatory function  evoked by SFAT-based ultrasound stimulation in normal brain slices. Using patch  clamp methods, one can monitor ionic flux and local field potentials, while  varying the acoustic stimulation frequency, intensity, pulse width, pulse shape  and pulse repetition frequency as well as the focal spot(s), focal size and force  direction. The patch clamp experiments will provide insights into biologic  mechanisms of ultrasonic neural stimulation, and could be a critical step toward  the development of a minimally invasive alternative to neuromodulation by  electrical stimulation in the treatment of neurologic disorders such as epilepsy.  If the underlying mechanisms of ultrasonic neural stimulation are well  understood, a transcranial focused ultrasound beam can possibly modulate  pathological neural activities, without surgery, running wire, or any damaging  effects from penetrating probe.","2022","2024-03-06 17:11:09","2024-03-06T17:11:09Z","","657-670","","","2393","","Methods Mol Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Although high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is evolved  as such an outstanding US-based approach, its insufficient therapeutic effect and  the high-intensity induced potential damage to surrounding normal tissues  hindered its development towards practical application. As opposed to high  intensity ultrasound, sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a low intensity US-based  method which exhibits certain therapeutic effects against cancer via  sonosensitizers-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction. METHODS:  Hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) loaded CaCO(3) nanoparticles (designated  as Ca@H) were synthesized by a gas diffusion method. The pH-responsive  performance, in vitro SDT, ex vivo HIFU therapy (HIFUT), photoacoustic (PA)  imaging and in vivo HIFUT combined with SDT were investigated thoroughly.  RESULTS: Ca@H NPs gradually decomposed in acid tumor microenvironment, produced  CO(2) and released HMME. Both CO(2) and HMME enhanced photoacoustic (PA) imaging.  The generated CO(2) bubbles also enhanced HIFUT by inducing an enlarged ablation  area. The tumor ablation efficiency (61.04%) was significantly improved with a  combination of HIFU therapy and SDT. CONCLUSION: pH-responsive Ca@H NPs have been  successfully constructed for PA imaging-guided/monitored HIFUT combined with SDT.  With the assistance of pH-responsive Ca@H NPs, the combination of these two  US-based therapies is expected to play a role in the treatment of non-invasive  tumor in the future.","2022","2024-03-06 17:11:02","2024-03-06T17:11:02Z","","333-350","","","17","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Gao et al.","","","","","","PMID: 35115772  PMCID: PMC8800590","","","","*Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; *Nanoparticles; *Ultrasonic Therapy; CaCO3 nanoparticles; Cell Line, Tumor; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy; nanomedicine; sonodynamic therapy; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Patients with DRE undergoing SEEG for localization of the  seizure onset zone (SOZ) were prospectively enrolled. FUS was delivered to the  SOZ using a neuronavigation-guided FUS system (ceiling spatial-peak  temporal-average intensity level = 2.8 W/cm(2) , duty cycle = 30%, modulating  duration = 10 min). Simultaneous SEEG recordings were obtained during sonication  and for 3 days after treatment. Seizures, interictal epileptiform discharges, and  adverse events after FUS were monitored. RESULTS: Six patients met the  eligibility criteria and completed FUS treatment. A decrease in seizure frequency  was observed in two patients within the 3-day follow-up; however, one patient  presented an increase in the frequency of subclinical seizures. Posttreatment  magnetic resonance imaging revealed neither lesion nor brain edema. Significant  changes in spectral power of SEEG were noted at the targeted electrodes during  FUS treatment. One patient reported subjective scalp heating during FUS, and one  patient developed transient naming and memory impairment that resolved within 3  weeks after FUS.

Since  aggressive cancer cells utilize oxidative stress (Ox-stress) and endoplasmic  reticulum stress (ER-stress) pathways for their survival and recurrence, we  hypothesized that pre-treatment with drugs that disrupt stress-signaling pathways  in tumor cells may increase FUS efficacy. Using four different PCa cell lines,  i.e., LNCaP, C4-2B, 22Rv1 and DU145, we tested the in vitro effects of FUS, alone  and in combination with two clinically tested drugs that increase Ox-stress  (i.e., CDDO-me) or ER-stress (i.e., nelfinavir). As compared to standalone FUS,  significant (p < 0.05) suppressions in both survival and recurrence of PCa cells  were observed following pre-sensitization with low-dose CDDO-me (100 nM) and/or  nelfinavir (2 µM). In drug pre-sensitized cells, significant anticancer effects  were evident at a FUS intensity of as low as 0.7 kW/cm(2). This combined  mechanochemical disruption (MCD) approach decreased cell proliferation, migration  and clonogenic ability and increased apoptosis/necrosis and reactive oxygen  species (ROS) production. Furthermore, although activated in cells that survived  standalone FUS, pre-sensitization with CDDO-me and/or nelfinavir suppressed both  total and activated (phosphorylated) NF-κB and Akt protein levels. Thus, a  combined MCD therapy may be a safe and effective approach towards the targeted  elimination of aggressive PCa cells.","2022-02-09","2024-03-06 17:10:56","2024-03-06T17:10:56Z","","","","2","11","","Antioxidants (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 35204223  PMCID: PMC8868501","","","","CDDO-me; ER-stress; aggressive phenotype; combined mechanochemical disruption; focused ultrasound; nelfinavir; oxidative stress; prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Two hundred and three patients with a solitary uterine fibroid were enrolled in  this study. Every patient underwent transvaginal sonography (TVS) and magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) before HIFU. The patients were divided into hypointense,  isointense and hyperintense fibroid groups based on T2 weighted MR imaging  characteristics, and ultrasonic image indexes of the fibroids in different groups  were compared. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the  correlation between ultrasonic image indexes and energy efficiency factor (EEF),  non-perfused volume (NPV) ratio of uterine fibroids. RESULTS: Among them, 72  patients had a hypointense fibroid, 70 had an isointense fibroid and 61 had a  hyperintense fibroid. Significant differences were observed in the ultrasound  imaging gray scale value difference between the myometrium and uterine fibroids  (GSmyo-fib), the ultrasound imaging gray scale value ratio of fibroids over the  myometrium (GSfib/myo), and the ratio of power Doppler pixel area to fibroid area  (PDPA/FA) among the three groups (p < 0.05). Linear regression analysis showed  that the PDPA/FA and the location of fibroids were the factors affecting the NPV  ratio, a model for predicting the NPV ratio was established.

This study aimed to explore the accuracy and predictive value of using T-VIM in  combination with tractography and resting-state functional connectivity  techniques to perform magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound  (MRgFUS) thalamotomy as a treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: PD  patients underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy and were recruited for functional MRI  scanning. A subscore of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor was used to evaluate  tremor improvement. T-VIM and surgical VIM (S-VIM) were defined on preoperative  diffusion tensor MRI and 24-hour postoperative T1-weighted imaging, respectively.  The overlapping volume and center distance between S-VIM and T-VIM were measured  to determine their correlations with 12-month postoperative tremor improvement.  Moreover, pretherapeutic functional connectivity of T-VIM or S-VIM, based on  region-of-interest connectivity and whole-brain seed-to-voxel connectivity, was  measured with the resting-state functional connectivity technique to investigate  their correlations with tremor improvement. RESULTS: All patients had excellent  tremor improvement (mean [range] tremor improvement 74.82% [50.00%-94.44%]). The  authors found that both overlapping volume and center distance between T-VIM and  S-VIM were significantly correlated with tremor improvement (r = 0.788 and p =  0.012 for overlapping volume; r = -0.696 and p = 0.037 for center distance).  Pretherapeutic functional connectivity of T-VIM with the ipsilateral sensorimotor  cortex (r = 0.876 and p = 0.002), subthalamic nucleus (r = 0.700 and p = 0.036),  and visual area (r = 0.911 and p = 0.001) was significantly and positively  correlated with tremor improvement. CONCLUSIONS: T-VIM may improve the clinical  application of MRgFUS thalamotomy as a treatment of PD.

We hypothesize that BBB/BTB disruption  (BBB/BTB-D) with focused ultrasound (FUS) and microbubbles (MB) increases immune  infiltration in GB. As a prelude to rational combination of FUS with ITx, we  herein investigate the impact of localized BBB/BTB-D on innate and adaptive  immune responses in an orthotopic murine GB model. METHODS: Mice with GL261  gliomas received i.v. MB and underwent FUS BBB/BTB-D (1.1 MHz, 0.5 Hz pulse  repetition frequency, 10 ms bursts, 0.4-0.6 MPa). Brains, meninges, and  peripheral lymphoid organs were excised and examined by flow cytometry 1-2 weeks  following FUS. RESULTS: The number of dendritic cells (DC) was significantly  elevated in GL261 tumors and draining cervical LN in response to sonication.  CD86 + DC frequency was also upregulated with 0.6 MPa FUS, suggesting increased  maturity. While FUS did not significantly alter CD8 + T cell frequency across  evaluated organs, these cells upregulated checkpoint molecules at 1 week  post-FUS, suggesting increased activation. By 2 weeks post-FUS, we noted  emergence of adaptive resistance mechanisms, including upregulation of TIGIT on  CD4 + T cells and CD155 on non-immune tumor and stromal cells. CONCLUSIONS: FUS  BBB/BTB-D exerts mild, transient inflammatory effects in gliomas-suggesting that  its combination with adjunct therapeutic strategies targeting adaptive resistance  may improve outcomes. The potential for FUS-mediated BBB/BTB-D to modify  immunological signatures is a timely and important consideration for ongoing  clinical trials investigating this regimen in GB.","2022-01","2024-03-06 17:10:52","2024-03-06T17:10:52Z","","109-122","","1","156","","J Neurooncol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

Here, we  report a new skin-disruption method that uses highly-focused ultrasound to  controllably perforate murine skin. We showed that programming of ultrasound  parameters varied skin perforation area from 0.078 ± 0.045 mm(2) to  1.295 ± 0.279 mm(2). The skin perforation area increased with increasing  ultrasound pressure and exposure time, and decreased with increasing ultrasound  frequency and incidence angle. Moreover, successful perforation can be monitored  using ultrasound pulse-echo imaging. We found that ultrasound perforation  elevated local skin expression of heat shock protein 70 and effectively attracted  MHC II-positive immune cells after intradermal delivery of Hepatitis B surface  antigen (HBsAg). We demonstrated that the antigen dose delivered by ultrasound  perforation can be effectively modulated via programmable perforation arrays  (comprised of 1 × 2, 1 × 3, 1 × 5 or 3 × 3 areas of exposure). Using a 1 × 3  perforation array for vaccination, the measured mean optical density (OD) value  of serum anti-HBsAg IgG was slightly higher than that of intradermal injection.  The addition of an adjuvant of recombinant cholera toxin B further increased OD  values of anti-HBsAg IgG.

However, its learning curve has not  been described in the medical literature. METHODS: All patients with  biopsy-proven fibroadenoma considered indicated for HIFU were screened for  eligibility for HIFU treatment. A total of 60 patients were recruited according  to the pre-defined sample size calculation. RESULTS: Sixty consecutive patients  were divided into three cohorts in chronological order. The mean tumor volume  shrinkage rates in cohorts 1, 2, and 3 at 6 months post-HIFU ablation were 38%,  34%, and 59%, respectively. Significant tumor shrinkage was observed from case 41  onward (p < 0.0001). Similarly, the mean tumor volume shrinkage rates in cohorts  1, 2, and 3 at 12 months post-HIFU ablation were 45%, 51%, and 71%, respectively.  Significant tumor shrinkage was observed from case 41 onwards (p < 0.0473). The  mean procedure time for the first 20 patients was 48.5 (range 45-75) minutes,  while that in the second 20 patients was 39.7 (range 20-60) minutes, and that in  the last 20 patients was 28.9 (range 15-45) minutes.

Usually, people affected are between 20 s and  30 s. When symptomatic, an effective treatment is mandatory for the management of  these lesions to allow for a ful quality of life. The possibilities of treatment  range from chirurgical en-block resection (procedure of surgical oncology aiming  to remove a tumoral mass in its entirety, completely surrounded by a continuous  layer of healthy tissue) to interventional approaches that, nowadays, are  considered the most affordable and sustainable in terms of effectiveness,  recovery after procedure, and for bone structure sparing. The main techniques  used for osteoid osteomas and osteoblastomas are radio frequency ablation (RFA)  and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS): the most important  difference between these approaches is the needleless approach of MRgFUS, which  further reduces the minimal invasiveness of RFA (and the related consequences)  and the absence of exposure to ionizing radiation. Despite their high efficacy, a  recurrence of pathology may occur due to a failure in therapy. In light of this,  describing the various possibilities of follow up protocols and the imaging  aspects of recurrence or incomplete treatment is mandatory. In the scenario given  in the literature, many authors have tried to asses an organized follow up  protocol of these patients, but many of them did not undergo periodical magnetic  resonance (MR) or computerized tomography (CT) because of the lack of  symptomatology. However, even if it seems that clinical evolution is central,  different papers describe the protocol useful to detect eventual relapse. The aim  of our manuscript is to review the various possibilities of follow-up of these  patients and to bring together the most salient aspects found during the  management of these osteocytic bone lesions.","2022-04-02","2024-03-06 17:00:39","2024-03-06T17:00:39Z","","","","7","11","","J Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 35407593  PMCID: PMC8999856","","","","MRgFUS; ablation; follow-up; interventional radiology; osteoblastoma; osteocytic tumor; osteoid osteoma; radiofrequency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: PFP was  encapsulated by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to form a nanometer-sized  droplet (PLGA-PFP), which was added to an isolated perfused liver system. Meanwhile,  phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as a control. The perfused liver was  exposed to HIFU (150 W, t = 3/5/10 s) at various duty cycles (DCs). The ultrasound  images, cavitation emissions, and temperature were recorded. Rabbits with  subcutaneous VX2 tumors were exposed to HIFU (150 W) at various DCs with or without  PLGA-PFP. After ablation, necrosis volume and energy efficiency factor were  calculated. Pathologic characteristics were observed. RESULTS: Compared to the PBS  control, PLGA-PFP nanoemulsions markedly enhanced HIFU-induced necrosis volume in  both perfused livers and subcutaneous VX2 tumor-bearing rabbits (P <.05). Inertial  cavitation was much stronger in the pulsed-HIFU exposure at 10% than that in the  continuous-wave HIFU exposure (P <.01). Peak temperature at 100% DC was  significantly higher than that at 10% (P <.05). Compared to 100% DC HIFU exposure,  the mean necrosis volume induced by 10 s exposure at 50% DC was significantly larger  (P <.005) but lower at 10% DC in the isolated perfused livers (P <.05). In addition,  the mean necrosis volume in subcutaneous VX2 tumor-bearing rabbits was significantly  increased after HIFU exposure at 10% DC when compared to those at 100% DC (P <.05).  Histopathologic analysis showed liquefaction necrosis in pulsed HIFU. CONCLUSION:  PLGA-PFP nanoemulsions can enhance HIFU ablation in the isolated perfused livers and  promote tumor ablation in the subcutaneous xenograft rabbit model. Appropriate  pulsed HIFU exposure may increase the necrosis volume and reduce total ultrasound  energy required for HIFU ablation.","2021-03-16","2024-03-06 17:00:35","2024-03-06T17:00:35Z","","","","","","","J Ultrasound Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 33724514","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; *Neoplasms; Animals; Fluorocarbons; Liver/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Rabbits; cancer treatment; cavitation; high-intensity focused ultrasound; perfusion flow rate; poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoemulsions; porcine liver perfusion; thermal ablation; thermalablation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Patients from a  20-center prospective study were enrolled in this study. In this study, among the  20 clinical centers, five centers had physician with >3 years of HIFU experience,  and the other 15 centers initiated HIFU therapy <3 years, were defined as the  experienced group and the inexperienced group, respectively. Technical success  was defined as achieving NPVR ≥ 80% of uterine fibroids with no major  complications and it was defined as the successful group; otherwise, it was  defined as the unsuccessful group. RESULTS: A total of 1,352 patients were  included at the age of 41.32 ± 5.08 years.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is one of the most studied sources  for tissue ablation and has been used since the 1990s. OBJECTIVE: To provide 21-yr  oncological long-term follow-up data of an unselected series of patients who  underwent whole-gland HIFU for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND  PARTICIPANTS: A total of 674 patients were treated between November 1997 and  November 2012 in one university center. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS: The oncological outcome was assessed by biopsy failure-free survival  (BFFS), salvage treatment-free survival (STFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS),  cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Multivariable Cox  proportional hazard regression analyses were performed to estimate the prognostic  relevance of clinical variables. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In total, 560 patients  were included into the evaluation and the median follow-up was 15.1 yr, with a range  up to 21.4 yr. At 15 yr, CSS rates for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients  were 95%, 89%, and 65%, respectively; MFS, STFS-1 (salvage treatment other than  HIFU), STFS-2 (salvage treatment including repeat HIFU), and BFFS rates were 91%,  85%, and 58%; 77%, 63%, and 29%; 67%, 52%, and 28%; and 82%, 73%, and 47%,  respectively. Preoperative high-risk category was an independent predictor of  inferior OS, CSS, MFS, STFS, and BFFS. CONCLUSIONS: Although whole-gland HIFU  achieved good long-term cancer control in low- and intermediate-risk patients,  high-risk patients should not be treated routinely by HIFU. Intermediate-risk  patients achieve high CSS and MFS rates, but a relevant salvage treatment rate has  to be reckoned with. Long-term data after whole-gland therapy might help derive  implications for focal treatment sources and patient selection. PATIENT SUMMARY:  Long-term data after whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy  are crucial to prove its oncological efficacy, and may help derive implications for  focal treatment strategies and patient selection. In this context, whole-gland HIFU  achieved good long-term cancer control up to 21 yr in low- and intermediate-risk  prostate cancer (PCa) patients.

Recently, highly stable persistent radicals are considered to be within  reach, thanks to several radical stabilization strategies such as spin  delocalization and steric protection. N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-derived  substituents can be attached to a radical center for these purposes, as  illustrated by numerous NHC-stabilized radicals reported in the last two  decades.This Account describes our recent work on developing NHC-derived  persistent radicals, as well as their prospective applications. Considering that  NHCs not only stabilize radicals but also reversibly interact with gas molecules,  in 2015 our group reported NHC-nitric oxide (NHC-NO) radicals produced by  reversibly trapping nitric oxide (NO) radical gas in NHCs. The resultant  compounds were loaded into biocompatible poly(ethylene  glycol)-block-poly(caprolactone) (PEG-b-PCL) micelles and injected into  tumor-bearing mice. Then, NO release was triggered by high-intensity focused  ultrasound irradiation of the tumor tissue. Furthermore, the NHC-NO radicals  could also serve as a platform to generate other organic radicals such as oxime  ether or iminyl radicals. Apart from medicine-related applications, radicals  stabilized by NHCs can be used as energy storage materials. In this context, the  triazenyl radical containing two NHC units reported by our laboratory could be a  cathode active material in batteries, as an organic alternative to LiCoO(2). The  subsequently prepared unsymmetrical triazenyl radical derivatives were applied as  anolytes in nonaqueous all-organic redox flow batteries. In addition, a  ferrocene-based redox flow battery anolyte was obtained by introducing  NHC-derived substituents that effectively stabilize the ferrocenate derivatives  previously reported only at low temperatures. The batteries containing  NHC-supported radicals exhibited high energy efficiency and insignificant radical  decomposition over multiple cycles. Finally, toward developing air-persistent  organic radicals for flexible devices and MRI contrasting agents, we also  highlight our recent air- and physiologically stable organic radicals derived  from NHCs. Coordination of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane to the NHC-NO radical  produced a new radical cation that is stable in an organic solvent under air for  several months. The readily accessible 1,2-dicarbonyl radical cations generated  by the reaction of NHCs with oxalyl chloride are remarkably persistent even in an  aqueous solution for several months. They are also highly stable even under  physiological conditions, making them particularly attractive potential  candidates for organic MRI contrast agents. We hope that this Account will serve  as a guide for the future development of stable NHC-derived organic radicals and  draw the attention of the synthetic community to their potential applications in  material science.","2022-08-16","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2213-2223","","16","55","","Acc Chem Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35849761","","","","*Boranes; *Nitric Oxide; Animals; Cations; Methane/analogs & derivatives; Mice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preparation of a multifunctional drug-loaded phase-change nanoparticle (NP), pirfenidone perfluoropentane liposome NPs (PPL NPs), and  combined with low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) to influence epithelial  mesenchymal transition (EMT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by inhibiting the  activity of activated Hepatic Stellate Cells (a-HSCs). Methods. PPL NPs were  prepared by the thin film dispersion method. The appearance, particle size, zeta  potential, encapsulation efficiency, drug loading rate, drug release in vitro,  and stability of PPL NPs were tested. The role of a-HSCs in HCC metastasis was  studied by CCK-8, colony formation assay, apoptosis, cellular uptake assay, wound  healing assay, and Transwell assay. Western blot was used to detect the related  protein expression levels. In vitro and vivo, the acoustic droplet vaporization  (ADV) of PPL NPs was tested at different times and LIFU intensities. Biosafety of  the PPL NPs was assessed by measuring nude mouse body weight and hematoxylin and  eosin (H&E) staining. Results. The results showed that the PPL NPs had good  biosafety, with an average particle size of 346.6 ± 62.21 nm and an average zeta  potential of -15.23 mV. When the LIFU power is 2.4 W/cm(2), it can improve the  permeability of cells, further promote the uptake of drugs by cells, and improve  the toxicity of drugs. In vitro experiments showed that PPL NPs could inhibit the  proliferation of a-HSCs cells, thereby affecting the metastasis of HCC, and were  related to the TGFβ-Smad2/3-Snail signaling pathway. Both in vivo and in vitro  PPL NPs enhanced ultrasound imaging by LIFU-triggered ADV. Conclusion. The PPL  NPs designed and prepared in this study combined with LIFU irradiation could  significantly alter the EMT of HCC by inhibiting LX2. Clinically, PPL NPs will  also be considered a promising contrast agent due to their ultrasound imaging  capabilities.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","6441179","","","2022","","Biomed Res Int","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Xiaomeng Zou et al.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36411770  PMCID: PMC9675611","","","","*Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/pathology; *Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology; *Nanoparticles; Animals; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Hepatic Stellate Cells/pathology; Liposomes; Mice; Mice, Nude","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients and Methods: We performed a  retrospective multicenter study of RTRs diagnosed with cM0 PCa between 2001 and  2019. Primary outcomes were overall (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS).  Secondary outcomes included biochemical recurrence and/or progression after  active surveillance (AS) and evaluation of variables possibly influencing PCa  aggressiveness and outcomes. Management modalities included surgery, radiation,  cryotherapy, HIFU, AS, and watchful waiting. Results: We included 166 men from  nine institutions. Median age and eGFR at diagnosis were 67 (IQR 60−73) and 45.9  mL/min (IQR 31.5−63.4). ASA score was >2 in 58.4% of cases. Median time from  transplant to PCa diagnosis was 117 months (IQR 48−191.5), and median PSA at  diagnosis was 6.5 ng/mL (IQR 5.02−10). The biopsy Gleason score was ≥8 in 12.8%;  11.6% and 6.1% patients had suspicion of ≥cT3 > cT2 and cN+ disease. The most  frequent management method was radical prostatectomy (65.6%), followed by  radiation therapy (16.9%) and AS (10.2%). At a median follow-up of 60.5 months  (IQR 31−106) 22.9% of men (n = 38) died, with only n = 4 (2.4%) deaths due to  PCa. Local and systemic progression rates were 4.2% and 3.0%. On univariable  analysis, no major influence of immunosuppression type was noted, with the  exception of a protective effect of antiproliferative agents (HR 0.39, 95% CI  0.16−0.97, p = 0.04) associated with a decreased risk of biochemical recurrence  (BCR) or progression after AS. Conclusion: PCa diagnosed in RTRs is mainly of low  to intermediate risk and organ-confined at diagnosis, with good cancer control  and low PCa death at intermediate follow-up. RTRs have a non-negligible risk of  death from causes other than PCa. Aggressive upfront management of the majority  of RTRs with PCa may, therefore, be avoided.","2022-12-28","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","1","15","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36612184  PMCID: PMC9818510","","","","immunosuppression; prostate cancer; renal transplant; robotic radical prostatectomy; treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While numerous strategies have been  proposed to treat CNS tumors, the treatment efficacy is still low mainly due to  the existence of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB). BBB is a natural cellular layer  between the circulatory system and brain extracellular fluid, limiting the  transfer of drug particles and confining the routine treatment strategies in  which drugs are released in the blood. Consequently, direct drug delivery methods  have been devised to bypass the BBB. However, the efficiency of these methods is  not enough to treat deep and large brain tumors. In the study at hand, the effect  of focused ultrasound (FUS) waves on enhancing drug delivery to brain tumors,  through ultrasound-assisted convection-enhanced delivery (UCED), has been  investigated. First, brain mimicking gels were synthesized to mimic the CNS  microenvironment, and the drug solution was injected into them. Second, FUS waves  with the resonance frequency of 1.1 MHz were applied to the drug injected zone.  Next, a finite element (FE) model was developed to evaluate the pre-existing  equation in the literature for describing the drug delivery via acoustic  streaming in brain tissue. Experimental results showed that the FUS transducer  was able to enhance the drug volume distribution up to 500% relative to  convection-enhanced delivery alone (CED). Numerical analysis showed that the FE  model could replicate the experimental penetration depths with a mean difference  value of less than 21%, and acoustic streaming plays a significant role in UCED.  Therefore, the results of this study could open a new way to develop FE models of  the brain to better evaluate the UCED and reduce the costs of conducting clinical  and animal studies.","2022-11-11","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","19299","","1","12","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Following the encouraging findings of several  such case reports, there is a growing interest in the potential application of  PSMA-targeted PET imaging for diagnostics, theranostics, and monitoring of CNS  tumors. This is a systematic literature review on PSMA-binding tracers in CNS  tumors. METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted, including preclinical and  clinical reports. One hundred and twelve records were identified, and after  screening, 56 were included in the final report. RESULTS: Tissue studies  demonstrated PSMA expression in tumor vascular endothelial cells, without  expression in normal brain tissue, though the extent and intensity of staining  varied by anti-PSMA antibody and methodology. Most included studies reported on  gliomas, which showed strong PSMA ligand uptake and more favorable tumor to  background ratios than other PET tracers. There are also case reports  demonstrating PSMA ligand uptake in prostate cancer brain metastases, nonprostate  cancer brain metastases, and meningiomas. We also review the properties of the  various PSMA-binding radiotracers available. Therapeutic and theranostic  applications of PSMA-binding tracers have been studied, including labeled alpha-  and beta-ray emitting isotopes, as well as PSMA targeting in directing MRI-guided  focused ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: There is a potential application for  PSMA-targeted PET in neuro-oncology as a combination of diagnostic and  therapeutic use, as a theranostic modality for managing CNS tumors. Further  research is needed regarding the mechanism(s) of PSMA expression in CNS tumors  and its differential performance by tumor type.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","5358545","","","2022","","Mol Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Brittany M.

ADV has been utilized in many biomedical applications. For localized drug  release, phase-shift emulsions with a bioactive payload can be incorporated  within a hydrogel to yield an acoustically-responsive scaffold (ARS). The  dynamics of ADV and associated drug release within hydrogels are not well  understood. Additionally, emulsions used in ARSs often contain high molecular  weight perfluorocarbons, which is unique relative to other ADV applications. In  this study, we used ultra-high-speed brightfield and fluorescence microscopy, at  frame rates up to 30 million and 0.5 million frames per second, respectively, to  elucidate ADV dynamics and payload release kinetics in fibrin-based ARSs  containing phase-shift emulsions with three different perfluorocarbons:  perfluoropentane (PFP), perfluorohexane (PFH), and perfluorooctane (PFO). At an  ultrasound excitation frequency of 2.5 MHz, the maximum expansion ratio, defined  as the maximum bubble diameter during ADV normalized by the initial emulsion  diameter, was 4.3 ± 0.8, 4.1 ± 0.6, and 3.6 ± 0.4, for PFP, PFH, PFO emulsions,  respectively. ADV yielded stable bubble formation in PFP and PFH emulsions,  though the bubble growth rate post-ADV was three orders of magnitudes slower in  the latter emulsion. Comparatively, ADV generated bubbles in PFO emulsions  underwent repeated vaporization/recondensation or fragmentation. Different  ADV-generated bubble dynamics resulted in distinct release kinetics in  phase-shift emulsions carrying fluorescently-labeled payloads. The results  provide physical insight enabling the modulation of bubble dynamics with ADV and  hence release kinetics, which can be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic  applications of ultrasound.","2022-08","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","106090","","","88","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Herein, we report the use of indocyanine green  (ICG)-dopped microbubbles (MBs-ICG) for visualizing the FUS-induced BBB opening  and enhancing the photothermal therapy (PTT) against GBM. The MBs-ICG show bright  fluorescence in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II), ultrasound contrast,  and ultrasound-induced size transformation properties. By virtue of complementary  contrast properties, MBs-ICG can be successfully applied for cerebral vascular  imaging with NIR-II fluorescence resolution of ∼168.9 μm and ultrasound  penetration depth of ∼7 mm. We further demonstrate that MBs-ICG can be combined  with FUS for in situ and synchronous visualization of the BBB opening with a  NIR-II fluorescence signal-to-background ratio of 6.2 ± 1.2. Finally, our data  show that the MBs-ICG transform into lipid-ICG nanoparticles under FUS  irradiation, which then rapidly penetrate the tumor tissues within 10 min and  enhance PTT in orthotopic GBM-bearing mice.

TMPs  capable of accurately mimicking real tissue in Magnetic Resonance guided Focused  Ultrasound (MRgFUS) applications should be fabricated with precise T1 and T2  relaxation times. Given the current popularity of the MRgFUS technology, we  herein performed a systematic review on the MR relaxation properties of different  phantoms types. Polyacrylamide (PAA) and agar based phantoms were proven capable  of accurately replicating critical thermal, acoustical, and MR relaxation  properties of various body tissues. Although gelatin phantoms were also proven  factional in this regard, they lack the capacity to withstand ablation  temperatures, and thus, are only recommended for hyperthermia applications. Other  gelling agents identified in the literature are Poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA),  Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), silicone, and TX-150/ TX-151; however, their efficacy  in thermal studies is yet to be established. PAA gels are favorable in that they  offer optical transparency enabling direct visualization of coagulative lesions.  On the other hand, agar phantoms have lower preparation costs and were proven  very promising for use with the MRgFUS technology, without the toxicity issues  related to the preparation and storage of PAA materials. Remarkably, agar turned  out to be the prominent modifier of the T2 relaxation time even for phantoms  containing other types of gelling agents instead of agar. This review could be  useful in manufacturing realistic MRgFUS phantoms while simultaneously indicating  an opportunity for further research in the field with a particular focus on the  MR behavior of agar-based TMPs.","2022-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","106600","","","119","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Using light as a probe for selective neuronal activation or  inhibition and as a means to read out neural activity has dramatically enhanced  our understanding of complex neural circuits. However, a common limitation of  optogenetic studies to date is their invasiveness and spatiotemporal range.  Direct viral injections into the brain tissue along with implantation of optical  fibers and recording electrodes can disrupt the neuronal circuitry and cause  significant damage. Conventional approaches are spatially limited around the site  of the direct injection and insufficient in examining large networks throughout  the brain. Lastly, optogenetics is currently not easily scalable to large animals  or humans. Here, we demonstrate that optogenetic excitation can be achieved  entirely non-invasively through the intact skull in mice. Using a needle-free  combination of focused ultrasound-mediated viral delivery and extracorporeal  illumination with red light, we achieved selective neuronal activation at depths  up to 4 mm in the murine brain, confirmed through cFos expression and  electrophysiology measurements within the treated areas. Ultrasound treatment  significantly reduced freezing time during recall in fear conditioning  experiments, but remote light exposure had a moderate effect on the freezing  behavior of mice treated with viral vectors. The proposed method has the  potential to open new avenues of studying, but also stimulating, neuronal  networks, in an effort to elucidate normal or dysfunctional brain activity and  treat neurological diseases. Finally, the same non-invasive methodology could be  combined with gene therapy and applied to other organs, such as the eye and the  heart.","2022-08","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","927-941","","4","15","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

While most surgeries are designed to correct  apparent anatomical abnormalities, no discrete cerebral anatomical lesion is  evident in most psychiatric diseases amenable to invasive interventions. Finding  the optimal surgical targets in mental illness is troublesome. In general,  contemporary psychosurgical procedures can be classified into one of two primary  modalities: lesioning and stimulation procedures. The first group is divided into  (a) thermocoagulation and (b) stereotactic radiosurgery or recently introduced  transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound, whereas stimulation  techniques mainly include deep brain stimulation (DBS), cortical stimulation, and  the vagus nerve stimulation. The most studied psychiatric diseases amenable to  psychosurgical interventions are severe treatment-resistant major depressive  disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, anorexia nervosa,  schizophrenia, and substance use disorder. Furthermore, modern neuroimaging  techniques spurred the interest of clinicians to identify cerebral regions  amenable to be manipulated to control psychiatric symptoms. On this way, the  concept of a multi-nodal network need to be embraced, enticing the collaboration  of psychiatrists, psychologists, neurologists and neurosurgeons participating in  multidisciplinary groups, conducting well-designed clinical trials.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","33-59","","1","270","","Prog Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The standard of care has only  changed marginally in the past 17 years, and few new chemotherapies have emerged  to supplant or effectively combine with temozolomide. Concurrently, new  technologies and techniques are being investigated to overcome the  pharmacokinetic challenges associated with brain delivery, such as the blood  brain barrier (BBB), tissue penetration, diffusion, and clearance in order to  allow for potent agents to successful engage in tumor killing. Alternative  delivery modalities such as focused ultrasound and convection enhanced delivery  allow for the local disruption of the BBB, and the latter in particular has shown  promise in achieving broad distribution of agents in the brain. Furthermore, the  development of polymeric nanocarriers to encapsulate a variety of cargo,  including small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids, have allowed for  formulations that protect and control the release of said cargo to extend its  half-life. The combination of local delivery and nanocarriers presents an  exciting opportunity to address the limitations of current chemotherapies for GBM  toward the goal of improving safety and efficacy of treatment. However, much work  remains to establish standard criteria for selection and implementation of these  modalities before they can be widely implemented in the clinic.

The dynamics of PFCnDs  can vary drastically depending on the nanodroplet composition, including the  lipid shell properties. In this paper, we investigate the effect of varying the  ratio of PEGylated to non-PEGylated phospholipids in the outer shell of PFCnDs on  the acoustic nanodroplet vaporization (liquid to gas phase transition) and  inertial cavitation (rapid collapse of the vaporized nanodroplets) dynamics in  vitro when insonated with focused ultrasound.

PFCnDs with a lipid shell composed of 50:50  PEGylated to non-PEGylated lipids yielded the highest B-mode image intensity and  duration, as well as the greatest pressure difference between acoustic droplet  vaporization onset and inertial cavitation onset. We demonstrate that slight  changes in lipid shell composition of PFCnDs can significantly impact droplet  phase transitioning and inertial cavitation dynamics.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in  supporting survival, differentiation, growth, and synapse formation of neurons  and participates in the plasticity of nerves. However, it is difficult for BDNF  to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) due to its large molecular weight.  Low-frequency focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles (MBs) has been  demonstrated to be a promising method for opening the BBB non-invasively,  transiently, and locally. Here, we studied the therapeutic effect of FUS combined  with BDNF plasmid-loaded cationic microbubbles (BDNFp-CMBs) in a rat model of  autism. BDNF-CMBs were prepared and the transfection efficiency of FUS combined  with BDNF-CMBs was tested in vitro. A rat model of autism was established from  the juvenile male offspring of Sprague-Dawley (SD) pregnant rats treated with  sodium valproate (VPA) solution through intraperitoneal injection. The autism  rats were randomized into three groups: the VPA group, which received no  treatment, the BDNFp group, which was treated by injection of BDNFp, and the FUS  + BDNFp-CMBs group, which was administered FUS combined with BDNFp-CMBs.  Age-matched normal rats served as the control group (Con). Following treatment,  stereotyped, exploratory, and social-behavioral tests were performed on the  animals in each group. The rat brains were then collected for subsequent  histological examination, and the changes in synaptic structures in the  prefrontal cortex (PFC) were detected under transmission electron microscopy. The  results showed that the constructed BDNFp could be loaded onto CMBs with high  loading efficiency. The BDNFp-CMBs prepared in this study showed good stability  in vivo. FUS combined BDNFp-CMBs could effectively and non-invasively open the  BBB of rats. The stereotyped, exploratory, and social behaviors of the FUS +  BDNFp-CMBs group were significantly improved. Compared to the VPA group, the  abnormality of neuronal morphology and number in the PFC of the FUS + BDNFp-CMBs  was alleviated to a certain extent and was accompanied by restoration of the  damaged synapses in the encephalic region. Our work demonstrates the positive  therapeutic effect of BDNF delivered by FUS non-invasively across the BBB into  the PFC in a rat model of autism, offering a potential strategy for treating  autism.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","986571","","","16","","Front Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Shen, Li, Sun, Dong, Wang, Chang, Zhang and Wang.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36117626  PMCID: PMC9475200","","","","autism; blood-brain barrier; brain-derived neurotrophic factor; cationic microbubbles; focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, a multifunctional theranostic nanoparticle was  fabricated to enhance tumor targeted imaging and promote focused ultrasound (FUS)  ablation and chemotherapy and sonodynamic therapy (SDT). A multi-modal  synergistic therapy can improve the therapeutic efficacy and prognosis of TNBC.  METHODS: AS1411 aptamer modified PEG@PLGA nanoparticles encapsulated with  perfluorohexane (PFH) and anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) were constructed  (AS1411-DOX/PFH-PEG@PLGA) to enhance tumor targeted imaging to guide ablation and  synergistic effect of FUS/chemotherapy. FUS was utilized to trigger the  co-release of doxorubicin and simultaneously PFH phase transition and activate  DOX for SDT effect. The physicochemical, phase-changeable imaging capability,  biosafety of nanoparticles and multi-mode synergistic effects on growth of TNBC  were thoroughly evaluated in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: The synthesized  AS1411-DOX/PFH-PEG@PLGA (A-DPPs) nanoparticles are uniformly round with an  average diameter of 306.03 ± 5.35 nm and the zeta potential of -4.05 ± 0.13 mV,  displaying high biosafety and FUS-responsive drug release in vitro and in vivo.  AS1411 modified NPs specifically bind to 4T1 cells and elevate the ultrasound  contrast agent (UCA) image contrast intensity via PFH phase-transition after FUS  exposure. Moreover, the combined treatment of A-DPPs nanoparticles with FUS  exhibited significantly higher apoptosis rate, stronger inhibitory effect on 4T1  cell invasion in vitro, induced more reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enhanced  anti-tumor effect compared to a single therapy (p < 0.05). Additionally, the  joint strategy resulted in more intense cavitation effect and larger ablated  areas and reduced energy efficiency factor (EEF) both in vitro and in vivo.

Low  intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an emerging  technology for non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) that can penetrate cortical  and deep brain structures with more focal stimulation compared to existing NIBS  modalities. Theta burst TUS (tbTUS, TUS delivered in a theta burst pattern) is a  novel repetitive TUS protocol that can induce durable changes in motor cortex  excitability, thereby holding promise as a novel neuromodulation tool with  durable effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to elucidate the  neurophysiologic effects of tbTUS motor cortical excitability, as well on local  and global neural oscillations and network connectivity. METHODS: An 80-s train  of active or sham tbTUS was delivered to the left motor cortex in 15 healthy  subjects. Motor cortical excitability was investigated through transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS)-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs),  short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation  (ICF) using paired-pulse TMS. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings during  resting state and an index finger abduction-adduction task were used to assess  oscillatory brain responses and network connectivity. The correlations between  the changes in neural oscillations and motor cortical excitability were also  evaluated. RESULTS: tbTUS to the motor cortex results in a sustained increase in  MEP amplitude and decreased SICI, but no change in ICF. MEG spectral power  analysis revealed TUS-mediated desynchronization in alpha and beta spectral  power. Significant changes in alpha power were detected within the supplementary  motor cortex (Right > Left) and changes in beta power within bilateral  supplementary motor cortices, right basal ganglia and parietal regions. Coherence  analysis revealed increased local connectivity in motor areas. MEP and SICI  changes correlated with both local and inter-regional coherence. CONCLUSION: The  findings from this study provide novel insights into the neurophysiologic basis  of TUS-mediated neuroplasticity and point to the involvement of regions within  the motor network in mediating this sustained response. Future studies may  further characterize the durability of TUS-mediated neuroplasticity and its  clinical applications as a neuromodulation strategy for neurological and  psychiatric disorders.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1337-1347","","6","15","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

The microcapsules were dispersed in a planar microchamber filled with a gelatin  gel and sonicated using 1 MHz focused ultrasound. Different capsule populations  were obtained using a filtration technique to modify and control the capsule  sizes. The disruption ratio as a function of the concentration of capsules was  obtained through image processing of the recorded photomicrographs. We found that  the disruption ratio for each population exponentially decreases as the particle  number concentration (PNC) increases. The maximum disruption ratio of the  diameter-sorted capsules was larger than that of polydispersed capsules.  Particularly, for resonant capsule populations, the ratio was more than twice  that of polydispersed capsules.

In contrast,  mechanoluminescence has never been observed in liquids and colloidal solutions,  thus limiting its biological application in living organisms. Here, we report the  synthesis of mechanoluminescent fluids via a suppressed dissolution approach. We  demonstrate that this approach yields stable colloidal solutions comprising  mechanoluminescent nanocrystals with bright emissions in the range of 470-610 nm  and diameters down to 20 nm. These colloidal solutions can be recharged and  discharged repeatedly under photoexcitation and hydrodynamically focused  ultrasound, respectively, thus yielding rechargeable mechanoluminescent fluids  that can store photon energy in a reversible manner.

The primary objective is to assess the  efficacy of pain management of the nitrous oxide system during MFU-V treatment.  The secondary objectives include patient satisfaction and efficacy on reducing  facial laxity and improving aesthetic appearance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A  prospective, single-arm, split-face, open-label study. Ten patients were treated  with MFU-V without use of a self-administered nitrous oxide system on the right  side of the face, followed by use of the nitrous oxide system on the left. A  patient-reported Visual Analog Pain Intensity Scale was used to assess pain on  the right and left sides at 3 different treatment time points. Patient  satisfaction was measured using a 5-point Likert scale and efficacy was measured  using the Investigator GAIS and the Facial Laxity Score. RESULTS: Clinically  significant differences were seen between pain ratings for the treated and  untreated sides at 2 of the 3 time points. 100.0% of patients (n=9) who had  completed the study were very satisfied (55.6%) or somewhat satisfied (44.4%).  Five patients (55.6%) were scored as Improved on the GAIS and 4 patients (44.4%)  were scored as Much Improved. 90.00% (n=9) of patients had moderate lower face  and neck laxity prior to treatment, compared with 11.11% (n=1) and 22.22% (n=2)  with moderate laxity at follow-up.

We developed the MORPHIOUS software package, an unsupervised machine  learning workflow which can learn the morphologies of non-activated astrocytes  and microglia, and from this information, infer clusters of microglial and  astrocytic activation in brain tissue. METHODS: MORPHIOUS combines a one-class  support vector machine with the density-based spatial clustering of applications  with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to identify clusters of microglial and astrocytic  activation. Here, activation was triggered by permeabilizing the blood-brain  barrier (BBB) in the mouse hippocampus using focused ultrasound (FUS). At 7 day  post-treatment, MORPHIOUS was applied to evaluate microglial and astrocytic  activation in histological tissue. MORPHIOUS was further evaluated on hippocampal  sections of TgCRND8 mice, a model of amyloidosis that is prone to microglial and  astrocytic activation. RESULTS: MORPHIOUS defined two classes of microglia,  termed focal and proximal, that are spatially adjacent to the activating  stimulus. Focal and proximal microglia demonstrated activity-associated features,  including increased levels of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1  expression, enlarged soma size, and deramification. MORPHIOUS further identified  clusters of astrocytes characterized by activity-related changes in glial  fibrillary acidic protein expression and branching. To validate these  classifications following FUS, co-localization with activation markers were  assessed. Focal and proximal microglia co-localized with the transforming growth  factor beta 1, while proximal astrocytes co-localized with Nestin. In TgCRND8  mice, microglial and astrocytic activation clusters were found to correlate with  amyloid-β plaque load. Thus, by only referencing control microglial and  astrocytic morphologies, MORPHIOUS identified regions of interest corresponding  to microglial and astrocytic activation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our algorithm is a  reliable and sensitive method for characterizing microglial and astrocytic  activation following FUS-induced BBB permeability and in animal models of  neurodegeneration.","2022-01-29","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","24","","1","19","","J Neuroinflammation","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Method: We  designed and evaluated treatment strategies for breast and pancreatic cancer  combining magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation and  antibody therapies. With a combination of single-cell sequencing, spectral flow  cytometry, and histological analyses, we profiled an immune-suppressed KPC  (Kras(+/LSL-G12D); Trp53(+/LSL-R172H); Pdx1-Cre) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (MT4)  model and a dense epithelial neu deletion (NDL) HER2(+) mammary adenocarcinoma  model with a greater fraction of lymphocytes, natural killer cells and activated  dendritic cells. We then performed gene ontology analysis, spectral and digital  cytometry to assess the immune response to combination immunotherapies and  correlation with survival studies. Result: Based on gene ontology analysis,  adding ablation to immunotherapy enriched immune cell migration pathways in the  pancreatic cancer model and extensively enriched wound healing pathways in the  breast cancer model. With CIBERSORTx digital cytometry, aCD40 + aPD-1  immunotherapy combinations enhanced dendritic cell activation in both models. In  the MT4 TME, adding the combination of aCD40 antibody and checkpoint inhibitors  (aPD-1 and aCTLA-4) with ablation was synergistic, increasing activated natural  killer cells and T cells in distant tumors. Furthermore, ablation with  immunotherapy upregulated critical Ly6c myeloid remodeling phenotypes that  enhance T-cell effector function and increased granzyme and protease encoding  genes by as much as 100-fold.

However, the utility of this route of  administration is limited by poor brain and spinal cord parenchymal drug uptake  from the cerebrospinal fluid. We demonstrate that a simple noninvasive  transcranial ultrasound protocol can significantly increase influx of  cerebrospinal fluid into the perivascular spaces of the brain, to enhance the  uptake of intrathecally administered drugs. Specifically, we administered small  (~1 kDa) and large (~155 kDa) molecule agents into the cisterna magna of rats and  then applied low, diagnostic-intensity focused ultrasound in a scanning protocol  throughout the brain. Using real-time magnetic resonance imaging and ex vivo  histologic analyses, we observed significantly increased uptake of small molecule  agents into the brain parenchyma, and of both small and large molecule agents  into the perivascular space from the cerebrospinal fluid. Notably, there was no  evidence of brain parenchymal damage following this intervention. The low  intensity and noninvasive approach of transcranial ultrasound in this protocol  underscores the ready path to clinical translation of this technique. In this  manner, this protocol can be used to directly bypass the blood-brain barrier for  whole-brain delivery of a variety of agents. Additionally, this technique can  potentially be used as a means to probe the causal role of the glymphatic system  in the variety of disease and physiologic processes to which it has been  correlated.","2022-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","434-442","","","349","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

We are presenting the results obtained in  ET patients by evaluating the cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) and the  out-strength among cortical areas. METHODS: We recorded MEG-EMG signals in 16  patients with predominant tremor on the right upper limb. The examination was  performed the day before MRgFUS (T0) treatment, 24 hours (T1), and 3-months (T2)  after lesioning the left ViM. Normalized CMC (nCMC) and cortico-cortical  out-strength among cortical areas were assessed during isometric extension of the  right hand. RESULTS: According to the Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale,  13 of 16 patients were considered responders. At T1, in the beta-band, nCMC  increased in the left hemisphere, namely in the areas directly involved in motor  functions. At T2, the nCMC in non-motor areas decreased and the out-strength from  other examined cortical areas toward the left motor-area decreased. CONCLUSIONS:  In patients positively responding to MRgFUS, the CMC increased in the motor-area  of the treated hemisphere immediately after the treatment, while the  reorganization of CMC and cortico-cortical out-strength toward the cortical motor  area occurred with a delay. SIGNIFICANCE: The effective treatment with MRgFUS  corresponds with a readjustment of the CMC and of the communication between  cortical areas.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","67-71","","","144","","Clin Neurophysiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

METHODS: A total of 502 adenomyosis patients  after FUAS in Affiliated Nanchong Central Hospital of North Sichuan Medical  College from June 2017 to March 2021 were reviewed. Factors associated with  symptom recurrence of adenomyosis were analyzed by binary logistic regression  model. ROC was used to determine the optimal cutpoint. Magnitude of preoperative  CA125 relating to timing of symptom recurrence was measured by cox regression and  Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves. Besides, multiple liner regression model was used to  identify the impacting factors for preoperative CA125. RESULTS: Multiple binary  logistic analysis showed preoperative CA125 was related to symptom recurrence (OR  = 1.002, 95%: 1.000～1.004, p = 0.043). The ROC of preoperative CA125 for  recurrence validated 35 U/ml had a high sensitivity (82.5%). Preoperative CA125  was related to timing of symptom recurrence (HR = 2.255, 95%: 1.387-3.667,  p = 0.001). K-M curves showed medium recurrence time in preoperative CA125 level  >35 U/ml group (38.5 months) was shorter than that in CA125 level ≤35 U/ml group  (44.5 months) (p = 0.001). Multiple liner regression analyses showed uterus  volume and adenomyotic lesions volume positively correlated to preoperative CA125  level, while age negatively correlated to preoperative CA125 level. CONCLUSION:  The higher level of preoperative CA125 was related to an earlier onset of symptom  recurrence after FUAS.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1164-1169","","1","39","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36075579","","","","*Adenomyosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; CA-125 Antigen; CA125; Female; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography, Interventional; adenomyosis; focused ultrasound ablation surgery; symptom recurrence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to investigate whether  MRI-guided focused ultrasound focal therapy can safely reduce treatment burden  for patients with localised grade group 2 or 3 intermediate-risk prostate cancer.  METHODS: In this single-arm, multicentre, phase 2b study conducted at eight  health-care centres in the USA, we recruited men aged 50 years and older with  unilateral, MRI-visible, primary, intermediate-risk, previously untreated  prostate adenocarcinoma (prostate-specific antigen ≤20 ng/mL, grade group 2 or 3;  tumour classification ≤T2) confirmed on combined biopsy (combining MRI-targeted  and systematic biopsies). MRI-guided focused ultrasound energy, sequentially  titrated to temperatures sufficient for tissue ablation (about 60-70°C), was  delivered to the index lesion and a planned margin of 5 mm or more of normal  tissue, using real-time magnetic resonance thermometry for intraoperative  monitoring. Co-primary outcomes were oncological outcomes (absence of grade group  2 and higher cancer in the treated area at 6-month and 24-month combined biopsy;  when 24-month biopsy data were not available and grade group 2 or higher cancer  had occurred in the treated area at 6 months, the 6-month biopsy results were  included in the final analysis) and safety (adverse events up to 24 months) in  all patients enrolled in the study. This study is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01657942, and is no longer recruiting. FINDINGS: Between  May 4, 2017, and Dec 21, 2018, we assessed 194 patients for eligibility and  treated 101 patients with MRI-guided focused ultrasound. Median age was 63 years  (IQR 58-67) and median concentration of prostate-specific antigen was 5·7 ng/mL  (IQR 4·2-7·5). Most cancers were grade group 2 (79 [78%] of 101). At 24 months,  78 (88% [95% CI 79-94]) of 89 men had no evidence of grade group 2 or higher  prostate cancer in the treated area. No grade 4 or grade 5 treatment-related  adverse events were reported, and only one grade 3 adverse event (urinary tract  infection) was reported. There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION:  24-month biopsy outcomes show that MRI-guided focused ultrasound focal therapy is  safe and effectively treats grade group 2 or 3 prostate cancer. These results  support focal therapy for select patients and its use in comparative trials to  determine if a tissue-preserving approach is effective in delaying or eliminating  the need for radical whole-gland treatment in the long term.

The skull density ratio (SDR) is  one of the most dominant predictors of thermal increase prior to treatment.  However, users currently rely only on the average SDR value (SDRmean) as a  screening criterion, although some patients with low SDRmean values can achieve  sufficient thermal increase. The present study aimed to examine the numerical  distribution of SDR values across 1024 elements to identify more precise  predictors of thermal increase during MRgFUS. METHODS: The authors  retrospectively analyzed the correlations between the skull parameters and the  maximum temperature achieved during unilateral ventral intermediate nucleus  thalamotomy with MRgFUS in a cohort of 55 patients. In addition, the numerical  distribution of SDR values was quantified across 1024 elements by using the  skewness, kurtosis, entropy, and uniformity of the SDR histogram. Next, the  authors evaluated the correlation between the aforementioned indices and a peak  temperature > 55°C by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression  analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to  compare the predictive ability of the indices. The diagnostic performance of  significant factors was also assessed. RESULTS: The SDR skewness (SDRskewness)  was identified as a significant predictor of thermal increase in the univariate  and multivariate logistic regression analyses (p < 0.001, p = 0.013). Moreover,  the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the  SDRskewness exhibited a better predictive ability than the SDRmean, with area  under the curve values of 0.847 and 0.784, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The  SDRskewness is a more accurate predictor of thermal increase than the  conventional SDRmean. The authors suggest setting the SDRskewness cutoff value to  0.68. SDRskewness may allow for the inclusion of treatable patients with  essential tremor who would have been screened out based on the SDRmean exclusion  criterion.","2022-05-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1381-1386","","5","136","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34653973","","","","essential tremor; functional neurosurgery; histogram analysis; magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound; skewness; skull density ratio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We intentionally assign a  high-absorbing layer (HAL) near the part of the skin, where heat generation and  tissue ablation are observed, because of high energy loss in the interface  between water and breast skin. Results show that PC improves the effectiveness of  focusing by enhancing the focal peak and reducing the focal deviation; however,  PC does not suppress skin burn. AA and PC eliminate skin burns only if  appropriate amplitude weights are applied. A preliminary discussion on three  algorithms for obtaining amplitude weights is conducted as follows; First, we  switched off transducer channels using distance-to-HAL. This algorithm eliminates  skin burns while causing other undesirable burns by preserving 100% input energy.  Second, we use cross-correlated amplitude weights. It eliminates skin burn after  properly limiting large-amplitude weights while producing focal necrosis in a  smaller and slower manner. Third, we introduced root-mean-square (rms) level of  back-propagated wave (BPW) into cross-correlated amplitude weights. This new  algorithm produces focal ablation in 20 s without causing any skin burn. Although  longer irradiation time brings back skin burn, the result is satisfying since  short irradiation time is needed in HIFU treatment to avoid exceeding the  physical endurance of human patients. Moreover, this work indicates that  focus-control associated with an acoustic peak is insufficient. The effects of  the high attenuation area are significant and should be captured.","2022-11","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","3155-3164","","11","69","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36094976","","","","*Burns/prevention & control/etiology; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; Breast/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Humans; Skin/diagnostic imaging; Transducers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the applications of high-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU) simulations is the calculation of the thermal dose, which  indicates the amount of tissue destroyed using a state-of-the-art k-space  pseudospectral method. The thermal simulation is preceded by the calculation of  the average intensity within the acoustic simulation. Due to the time staggering  between the particle velocity and the acoustic pressure used in such simulations,  the average intensity calculation is typically executed offline after the  acoustic simulation consuming both disk space and time (the data can spread over  terabytes). Our new approach calculates the average intensity during the acoustic  simulation using the output coefficients of a new compression method which  enables resolving the time staggering on-the-fly with huge disk space savings. To  reduce RAM requirements, the article also presents a new 40-bit method for  encoding compression complex coefficients. Experimental numerical simulations  with the proposed method have shown that disk space requirements are up to 99%  lower. The simulation speed was not significantly affected by the approach and  the compression error did not affect the prediction accuracy of the thermal dose.  From the standpoint of supercomputers, the new approach is significantly more  economical. Saving computing resources increases the chances of real use of  acoustic simulations in practice. The method can be applied to signals of a  similar character, e.g., for electromagnetic radio waves.","2022-10","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2917-2929","","10","69","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35969568","","","","*Data Compression; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; Acoustics; Computer Simulation; Sound; Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among strategies developed  to improve drug delivery, nano-sized emulsions (i.e., nanoemulsions), employed as  nanocarriers, have been described. Moreover, focused ultrasound-mediated  blood-brain barrier disruption using microbubbles is an attractive method to  overcome this barrier, showing promising results in clinical trials. Therefore,  nanoemulsions combined with this technology represent a real opportunity to  bypass the constraints imposed by the blood-brain barrier and improve the  treatment of brain diseases. In this work, a stable freeze-dried emulsion of  perfluorooctyl bromide nanodroplets stabilized with home-made fluorinated  surfactants able to carry hydrophobic agents is developed. This formulation is  biocompatible and droplets composing the emulsion are internalized in multiple  cell lines. After intravenous administration in mice, droplets are eliminated  from the bloodstream in 24 h (blood half-life (t(1/2)) = 3.11 h) and no long-term  toxicity is expected since they are completely excreted from mice' bodies after  72 h. In addition, intracerebral accumulation of tagged droplets is safely and  significantly increased after focused ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier  disruption. Thus, the proposed nanoemulsion appears as a promising nanocarrier  for a successful focused ultrasound-mediated brain delivery of hydrophobic  agents.","2022-07-19","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","7","14","","Pharmaceutics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35890391  PMCID: PMC9323719","","","","blood–brain barrier; brain diseases; droplets; drug carrier; nanoemulsions; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A  retrospective analysis of residual myoma regrowth within 1 year was performed on  428 myomas in 339 patients who were diagnosed with uterine myoma and treated with  HIFU ablation in two hospital centers. In total, 851 radiomics features were  extracted from T2-weighted images (T2WI) obtained 1 day after HIFU ablation, and  the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator in the training cohort  (n = 243) was employed to select radiomics features. Support vector machines were  adopted to develop radiomics, clinicoradiological and combined radiomics-clinical  models to predict residual myoma regrowth, defined as an increase in residual  myoma volume of > 10% between that at day 1 post HIFU and that at follow-up MRI  within 1 year. These models were validated in both internal (n = 81) and external  (n = 104) test cohorts. The predictive performance and clinical application of  these models were assessed using receiver-operating-characteristics-curve  analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) and decision-curve analysis. RESULTS:  The AUCs of the T2WI-based radiomics prediction model in the internal and  external test cohorts were 0.834 (95% CI, 0.747-0.920) and 0.801 (95% CI,  0.712-0.889), respectively, and those of the clinicoradiological model were 0.888  (95% CI, 0.816-0.960) and 0.912 (95% CI, 0.851-0.973), respectively. The combined  model had better predictive performance than either the radiomics or the  clinicoradiological model, with AUC values of 0.922 (95% CI, 0.857-0.987) and  0.930 (95% CI, 0.880-0.980) in the internal and external test cohorts,  respectively. Decision-curve analysis also indicated that application of the  combined model has clinical value, this model achieving more net benefits than  the other two models. CONCLUSION: T2WI-based radiomics features can predict  effectively the occurrence of residual myoma regrowth within 1 year after HIFU  ablation of uterine myomas, which serves as an accurate and convenient reference  for clinical decision-making. © 2022 The Authors.

A relatively high sensitivity of the obtained  nanocarriers to LIFU and their preferential interactions with mitochondria in  cancer cells make these carriers promising candidates for cancer treatment,  including novel approaches to overcome drug resistance.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","102612","","","47","","Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Materials and Methods: Here, we implemented a petechial hemorrhage  using a novel technology, i.e., microbubble-assisted focused ultrasound (MB +  FUS). Results: This method increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier  by directly applying mechanical force to the vascular endothelial cells through  cavitation of the microbubbles. Microbubble-enhanced cavitation has the advantage  of controlling the degree and location of petechial hemorrhages. Conclusions: We  thus generated a preclinical rat model using noninvasive focal MB + FUS. This  method is histologically similar to actual petechial hemorrhages of the brain and  allows the achievement of a physiologically resembling petechial hemorrhage.

A  bubble-fluid-vessel coupling model is constructed to investigate the interactions  of the coupling system. The dynamics process of vessel damage due to UIC is  theoretically simulated with a finite element method, and a focused ultrasound  (FU) setup is carried out and used to assess the vessel damage. The results show  that shear stress contributes to vessel injury by cell detachment while normal  stress mainly causes distention injury. Similar changes in cell detachment in a  vessel over time can be observed with the experimental setup. The severity of  vascular injury is correlated to acoustic parameters, bubble-wall distance, and  microbubble sizes, and the duration of insonation..","2022-08","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","106103","","","88","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been proposed as a potential target for  neuromodulation to prove emotional and sleep qualities. We aim to set up an  appropriate clinical protocol for investigating the effects of tFUS stimulation  of the bilateral mPFC for modulating the function of the brain-wide network using  different sonication parameters. Seven participants received 20 min of 250 kHz  tFUS to the bilateral mPFC with excitatory (70% duty cycle with sonication  interval at 5 s) or suppressive (5% duty cycle with no interval) sonication  protocols, which were compared to a sham condition. By placing the cigar-shaped  sonication focus on the falx between both mPFCs, it was possible to  simultaneously stimulate the bilateral mPFCs. Brain activity was analyzed using  continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) recording during, before, and after  tFUS. We investigated whether tFUS stimulation under the different conditions  could lead to distinctive changes in brain activity in local brain regions where  tFUS was directly delivered, and also in adjacent or remote brain areas that were  not directly stimulated. This kind of study setting suggests that dynamic changes  in brain cortical responses can occur within short periods of time, and that the  distribution of these responses may differ depending on local brain states and  functional brain architecture at the time of tFUS administration, or perhaps, at  least temporarily, beyond the stimulation time. If so, tFUS could be useful for  temporarily modifying regional brain activity, modulating functional  connectivity, or reorganizing brain functions associated with various  neuropsychiatric diseases, such as insomnia and depression.","2022-06-30","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","13","11","","J Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35807094  PMCID: PMC9267901","","","","excitatory; medial prefrontal cortex; modulation; sonication parameters; suppressive; transcranial focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper is an initial work towards developing particle-mediated histotripsy (PMH) as a novel method of treating catheter-based medical device  (CBMD) intraluminal biofilms. Impact Statement. CBMDs commonly become infected  with bacterial biofilms leading to medical device failure, infection, and adverse  patient outcomes. Introduction. Histotripsy is a noninvasive focused ultrasound  ablation method that was recently proposed as a novel method to remove  intraluminal biofilms. Here, we explore the potential of combining histotripsy  with acoustically active particles to develop a PMH approach that can  noninvasively remove biofilms without the need for high acoustic pressures or  real-time image guidance for targeting. Methods. Histotripsy cavitation  thresholds in catheters containing either gas-filled microbubbles (MBs) or  fluid-filled nanocones (NCs) were determined. The ability of these particles to  sustain cavitation over multiple ultrasound pulses was tested after a series of  histotripsy exposures. Next, the ability of PMH to generate selective  intraluminal cavitation without generating extraluminal cavitation was tested.  Finally, the biofilm ablation and bactericidal capabilities of PMH were tested  using both MBs and NCs. Results. PMH significantly reduced the histotripsy  cavitation threshold, allowing for selective luminal cavitation for both MBs and  NCs. Results further showed PMH successfully removed intraluminal biofilms in  Tygon catheters. Finally, results from bactericidal experiments showed minimal  reduction in bacteria viability. Conclusion. The results of this study  demonstrate the potential for PMH to provide a new modality for removing  bacterial biofilms from CBMDs and suggest that additional work is warranted to  develop histotripsy and PMH for treatment of CBMD intraluminal biofilms.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","9826279","","","2022","","BME Front","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Christopher Childers et al.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37850182  PMCID: PMC10521694","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy men with focal lesions of PCa (all GG2  or GG3) underwent PGA with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) or  cryotherapy (CRYO) in prospective trials. Residual PCa in or near the ablation  zone was found in 37 men after a first PGA; 30 went on to receive a second PGA  and were the subjects of study. At 3 timepoints, baseline and 6 months after  first and second ablations, quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaires (IIEF, IPSS) and  MRI-guided biopsies (MRGB) were performed. Biopsies were targeted and systematic  at baseline and in follow-up, comprehensively about the ablation zone. RESULTS:  All 30 patients completed QOL questionnaires and 26 had MRGB at the 3 timepoints.  Mean QOL scores were not significantly different from the baseline after the  first or second PGA. No operative complications were encountered; and ""decisional  regret"" was reported in only 2/29 men after the repeat ablation. A decrease in  semen volume was reported by 25% of patients. Repeat ablation was successful  (absence of csPCa on MRGB) in 14/26 (53%) of men. PSA levels decreased and MRI  lesions resolved after ablations, but neither was a reliable predictor of biopsy  outcomes. CONCLUSION: When initial PGA fails, repeat PGA is a reasonable  consideration, because in near-term follow-up, secondary procedures appear to be  safe, causing only minimal detriment to urinary and sexual function, with csPCa  becoming undetectable by MRGB in approximately half the patients.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","161-167","","","170","","Urology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

However, the complex morphology of the skull hinders scholars from  precisely predicting the acoustic energy transmitted and the region of the brain  impacted during the sonication. This is due to the fact that different ultrasound  frequencies and skull morphology variations greatly affect wave propagation  through the skull. PURPOSE: Although the acoustic properties of human skull have  been studied for tFUS applications, such as tumor ablation using a multielement  phased array, there is no consensus about how to choose a single-element focused  ultrasound (FUS) transducer with a suitable frequency for neuromodulation. There  are interests in exploring the magnitude and dimension of tFUS beam through human  parietal bone for modulating specific brain lobes. Herein, we aim to investigate  the wave propagation of tFUS on human skulls to understand and address the  concerns above. METHODS: Both experimental measurements and numerical modeling  were conducted to investigate the transmission efficiency and beam pattern of  tFUS on five human skulls (C3 and C4 regions) using single-element FUS  transducers with six different frequencies (150-1500 kHz). The degassed skull was  placed in a water tank, and a calibrated hydrophone was utilized to measure  acoustic pressure past it. The cranial computed tomography scan data of each  skull were obtained to derive a high-resolution acoustic model (grid point  spacing: 0.25 mm) in simulations. Meanwhile, we modified the power-law exponent  of acoustic attenuation coefficient to validate numerical modeling and enabled it  to be served as a prediction tool, based on the experimental measurements.  RESULTS: The transmission efficiency and -6 dB beamwidth were evaluated and  compared for various frequencies. An exponential decrease in transmission  efficiency and a logarithmic decrease of -6 dB beamwidth with an increase in  ultrasound frequency were observed. It is found that a >750 kHz ultrasound leads  to a relatively lower tFUS transmission efficiency (<5%), whereas a <350 kHz  ultrasound contributes to a relatively broader beamwidth (>5 mm). Based on these  observations, we further analyzed the dependence of tFUS wave propagation on FUS  transducer aperture size. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully studied tFUS wave  propagation through human skulls at different frequencies experimentally and  numerically. The findings have important implications to predict tFUS wave  propagation for ultrasound neuromodulation in clinical applications, and guide  researchers to develop advanced ultrasound transducers as neural interfaces.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","38-49","","1","50","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

Better understanding of the relationship between the ultrasound  parameters and the ADV nucleation could provide an on-demand regulation and  enhancement of ADV for improved treatment outcome. In this work, ADV nucleation  was performed in a dual-frequency focused ultrasound configuration that consisted  of a continuous low-frequency ultrasound and a short high-frequency pulse. The  combination was modelled to investigate the effects of the driving frequency and  acoustic power on the nucleation rate, efficiency, onset time, and dimensions of  the nucleation region. The results showed that the inclusion of short pulsed  high-frequency ultrasound significantly increased the nucleation rate with less  energy, reduced the nucleation onset time, and changed the length-width ratio of  the nucleation region, indicating the dual-frequency ultrasound mode yields an  efficient enhancement of the ADV nucleation, compared to a single-frequency  ultrasound mode. Furthermore, the acoustic and temperature fields varied  independently with the dual-frequency ultrasound parameters. This facilitated the  spatial and temporal control over the ADV nucleation, and opens the door to the  possibility to realize on-demand regulation of the ADV occurrence in ultrasound  theranostics. In addition, the improved energy efficacy that is obtained with the  dual-frequency configuration lowered the requirements on hardware system,  increasing its flexibility and could facilitate its implementation in practical  applications.","2022-11","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","106224","","","90","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

This study examined the efficacy and safety of pulsed, low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) and determined its ability to  provide neuroprotection in a murine permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion  (pMCAO) model. Introduction. Focused ultrasound (FUS) has emerged as a new  therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke; however, its  nonthrombolytic properties remain ill-defined. Therefore, we examined how LIFU  influenced neuroprotection and vascular changes following stroke. Due to the  critical role of leptomeningeal anastomoses or pial collateral vessels, in  cerebral blood flow restoration and tissue protection following ischemic stroke,  we also investigated their growth and remodeling. Methods. Mice were exposed to  transcranial LIFU (fundamental frequency: 1.1 MHz, sonication duration: 300 ms,  interstimulus interval: 3 s, pulse repetition frequency: 1 kHz, duty cycle per  pulse: 50%, and peak negative pressure: -2.0 MPa) for 30 minutes following  induction of pMCAO and then evaluated for infarct volume, blood-brain barrier  (BBB) disruption, and pial collateral remodeling at 24 hrs post-pMCAO. Results.  We found significant neuroprotection in mice exposed to LIFU compared to mock  treatment. These findings correlated with a reduced area of IgG deposition in the  cerebral cortex, suggesting attenuation of BBB breakdown under LIFU conditions.  We also observed increased diameter of CD31-postive microvessels in the ischemic  cortex. We observed no significant difference in pial collateral vessel size  between FUS and mock treatment at 24 hrs post-pMCAO. Conclusion. Our data  suggests that therapeutic use of LIFU may induce protection through microvascular  remodeling that is not related to its thrombolytic activity.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","9864910","","","2022","","BME Front","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Alexandra M.

METHODS: We administered a  telephone or mail-in survey to patients who consecutively underwent unilateral  MRgFUS thalamotomy for ET at our institution over an 8-year period. Patients were  asked to self-report measures of hand tremor improvement, degree of overall  postprocedure improvement, activities of daily life, side effects, and  willingness to undergo the procedure again. Specific patient characteristics,  ultrasound treatment parameters, and postoperative radiological findings from  magnetic resonance imaging performed 1 day after the procedure were analyzed, and  multivariable linear regression was used to determine if these factors could  serve as predictors of clinical outcome. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients were  included in this study with a mean follow-up time of 3.0 years (range 2 months to  1 8.4 years). The mean patient-reported improvement in hand tremor at last  follow-up was 66%, and 73% of patients reported meaningful change in their  overall condition after the procedure. The percentages of patients reporting  normal or only minimal limitations with feeding, drinking, and writing ability at  last follow-up were 60%, 71%, and 48%, respectively. In the position of their  former selves, 89% of patients would again choose to undergo the procedure.  Larger lesions were correlated with a higher risk of adverse events.  DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: While subjective hand tremor improvement declines with  time, willingness to undergo the procedure again following MRgFUS thalamotomy for  ET remains very high even several years after the procedure.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","291-299","","5-6","100","","Stereotact Funct Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 S.

Despite extensive  research, PDAC is expected to become the second leading cause of mortality by  cancer by 2030. Ultrasound (US) has been used successfully in treating other  types of cancer and evidence is flourishing that it could benefit PDAC patients.  High-intensity focused US (HIFU) is currently used for pain management in  palliative care. In addition, clinical work is being performed to use US to  downstage borderline resectable tumors and increase the proportion of patients  eligible for surgical ablation. Focused US (FUS) can also induce mechanical  effects, which may elicit an anti-tumor response through disruption of the stroma  and can be used for targeted drug delivery. More recently, sonodynamic therapy  (akin to photodynamic therapy) and immunomodulation have brought new perspectives  in treating PDAC. The aim of this review is to summarize the current state of  those techniques and share our opinion on their future and challenges.","2022-05-24","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","11","14","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35681557  PMCID: PMC9179649","","","","HIFU; PDAC; cavitation; drug delivery; focused ultrasound; immunotherapy; sonodynamic therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
