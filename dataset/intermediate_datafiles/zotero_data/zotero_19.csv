Although frontline treatment options (medication, deep brain stimulation, and focused ultrasound ablation)  have provided significant relief, many patients are unsatisfied with the  outcomes. Peripheral suppression techniques, such as injections of botulinum  toxin or sensory electrical stimulation of muscles, are gaining popularity, but  could be optimized if the muscles most responsible for a patient's tremor were  identified. The purpose of this study was to quantify the relationship between  the activity in various upper limb muscles and the resulting tremor in patients  with ET. Surface electromyogram (sEMG) from the 15 major superficial muscles of  the upper limb and displacement of the hand and upper limb joints were recorded  from 22 persons with ET while they performed kinetic and postural tasks  representative of activities of daily living. We calculated the peak coherence  (frequency-dependent correlation) in the tremor band (4-8 Hz) between the sEMG of  each muscle and the displacement in each major degree of freedom (DOF). Averaged  across subjects with ET, the highest coherence was found between elbow flexors  (particularly biceps brachii and brachioradialis) and the distal DOF (forearm,  wrist, and hand motion), and between wrist extensors (extensor carpi radialis and  ulnaris) and the same distal DOF. These coherence values represent the upper  bound on the proportion of the tremor caused by each muscle. We conclude that,  without further information, elbow flexors and wrist extensors should be among  the first muscles considered for peripheral suppression techniques in persons  with ET.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We characterized the relationships between activity in  upper limb muscles and tremor in persons with essential tremor using coherence,  which provides an upper bound on the proportion of the tremor due to each muscle.  Averaged across subjects and various tasks, tremor in the hand and distal joints  was most coherent with elbow flexors and wrist extensors. We conclude that,  without further information, these muscle groups should be among the first  considered for peripheral suppression techniques.","2024-02-01","2024-03-06 17:05:16","2024-03-06T17:05:16Z","","337-348","","2","136","","J Appl Physiol (1985)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38126087","","","","*Essential Tremor/therapy; *Wrist/physiology; Activities of Daily Living; EMG; Elbow; Electromyography; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal/physiology; Tremor/therapy; Upper Extremity; coherence; essential tremor; joint; muscle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this review article, we  outline the incidence, pathophysiology, predictors, and preventative strategies  of this dreaded complication. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search in 10  databases/electronic search engines to access relevant publications. All articles  reporting complications following atrial fibrillation ablation, including  esophageal injury and fistula formation, were included for systematic review.  RESULTS: A total of 130 manuscripts were identified for the final review process.  The overall incidence of esophageal injury following atrial fibrillation ablation  was significantly higher with thermal ablation modalities (radiofrequency 5-40%,  cryoballoon 3-25%, high-intensity focused ultrasound < 10%) as opposed to  non-thermal ablation modalities (no cases reported to date). The incidence of  esophageal perforation and fistula formation with the use of thermal ablation  modalities is estimated to occur in less than 0.25% of all atrial fibrillation  ablation procedures. The use of luminal esophageal temperature monitoring probe  and mechanical esophageal deviation showed protective effect toward reducing the  incidence of this complication. The prognosis is very poor for patients who  develop atrioesophageal fistula, and the condition is rapidly fatal without  surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal perforation and fistula formation  following atrial fibrillation ablation are rare complications with poor  prognosis. Various strategies have been proposed to protect the esophagus and  reduce the incidence of this fearful complication. Pulsed field ablation is a  promising new ablation technology that may be the future answer toward reducing  the incidence of esophageal complications.","2024-03","2024-03-06 17:04:09","2024-03-06T17:04:09Z","","409-424","","2","67","","J Interv Card Electrophysiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

None of these are cancer-specific and are  commonly accompanied by side effects, including urinary incontinence and erectile  dysfunction. Moreover, subsequent surgical treatments following biochemical  recurrence after these interventions are either limited or affected by the  scarring present in the surrounding tissue. Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a  histidine-containing naturally occurring dipeptide which has been shown to have  an anti-tumorigenic role without any detrimental effect on healthy cells;  however, its effect on prostate cancer cells has never been investigated. In this  study, we investigated the effect of carnosine on cell proliferation and  metabolism in both a primary cultured androgen-resistant human prostate cancer  cell line, PC346Flu1 and murine TRAMP-C1 cells. Our results show that carnosine  has a significant dose-dependent inhibitory effect in vitro on the proliferation  of both human (PC346Flu1) and murine (TRAMP-C1) prostate cancer cells, which was  confirmed in 3D-models of the same cells. Carnosine was also shown to decrease  adenosine triphosphate content and reactive species which might have been caused  in part by the increase in SIRT3 also shown after carnosine treatment. These  encouraging results support the need for further human in vivo work to determine  the potential use of carnosine, either alone or, most likely, as an adjunct  therapy to surgical or other conventional treatments.","2024-01","2024-03-06 17:02:19","2024-03-06T17:02:19Z","","e18061","","2","28","","J Cell Mol Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

OBJECTIVES: This scoping review aimed to describe the current state of knowledge  about the diagnosis and treatment of XDP, to provide clinicians with a concise  and up-to-date overview. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of pertinent  literature on the diagnosis and treatment of XDP using Preferred Reporting Items  for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews  guidelines. RESULTS: There were 24 articles on diagnostic methods and 20 articles  on therapeutic interventions for XDP, with 7 review articles describing both. The  detection of the SVA retrotransposon insertion within the TAF1 gene is  confirmatory for XDP. Oral medications are marginally effective. Chemodenervation  with botulinum toxin is an effective treatment. Pallidal deep brain stimulation  (DBS) has been shown to provide significant improvement in the dystonia and  quality of life of patients with XDP for a longer time. A less invasive surgical  option is the transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound  (tcMRgFUS), which has shown promising effects with the limited number of case  reports available. CONCLUSION: XDP is a geneti disorder characterized by striatal  symptoms and pathology on neuroimaging. No effective oral medications are  available for the management of XDP. The use of botulinum toxin is limited by its  cost and duration of effects. As of now, pallidal DBS is deemed to be the best  option. Another promising option is the tcMRgFUS but still has limited studies on  its safety and efficacy in XDP.","2024-02","2024-03-06 17:01:37","2024-03-06T17:01:37Z","","105949","","","119","","Parkinsonism Relat Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

When paired with acoustically  active particles such as microbubbles (MBs), it can open the blood brain barrier  (BBB) to facilitate drug delivery otherwise inhibited due to the presence of BBB.  One of the parameters that affects the FUS beam propagation is the beam incidence  angle on the skull. Prior work by our group has shown that, as incidence angles  deviate from 90°, FUS focal pressures attenuate and result in a smaller BBB  opening volume. The incidence angles calculated in our prior studies were in 2D  and used skull information from CT. The study presented herein develops methods  to calculate incidence angle in 3D in non-human primate (NHP) skull fragments  using harmonic ultrasound imaging without using ionizing radiation. Our results  show that ultrasound harmonic imaging is capable of accurately depicting features  such as sutures and eye-sockets of the skull. Furthermore, we were able to  reproduce previously reported relationships between the incidence angle and FUS  beam attenuation. We also show feasibility of performing ultrasound harmonic  imaging in in-vivo non-human primates. The all-ultrasound method presented herein  combined with our neuronavigation system stands to increase more widespread  adoption of FUS and render it accessible by eliminating the need for CT cranial  mapping.","2024-01-17","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","1488","","1","14","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024.

During the last decade new treatment options were  developed for neurological indications based on blood-brain-barrier opening or  neuromodulation. Recently, the transcranial application of shock waves has been a  subject of research. However, the mechanisms of action are not yet understood.  Hence, it is necessary to know the energy that reaches the brain during the  treatment and the focusing characteristics within the tissue. METHODS: The sound  field of a therapeutic extracorporeal shock wave transducer was investigated  after passing human skull bone (n=5) or skull bone with brain tissue (n=2) in  this ex vivo study. The maximum and minimum pressure distribution and the focal  pressure curves were measured at different intensity levels and penetration  depths, and compared to measurements in water. RESULTS: Mean peak negative  pressures of up to -4.97 MPa were reached behind the brain tissue. The positive  peak pressure was attenuated by between 20.85 and 25.38 dB/cm by the skull bone.  Additional damping by the brain tissue corresponded to between 0.29 and  0.83 dB/cm. Compared to the measurements in water, the pulse intensity integral  in the focal spot was reduced by 84 % by the skull bone and by additional 2 % due  to the brain tissue, resulting in a total damping of up to 86 %. The focal  position was shifted up to 8 mm, whereas the basic shape of the pressure curves  was preserved.

A pilot study  was conducted in order to investigate the feasibility, and safety of the device  in a large animal model and a pilot clinical trial. METHODS: A flat, fully  steerable FUS phased array with 4096 elements was designed and manufactured to be  compatible with an MR scanner. Pre-clinical experiments were carried out for  testing the accuracy of the focus at different steering angles as well as  evaluating the ablation efficiency using MR thermometry. Eleven patients with  uterine fibroids were treated in the pilot clinical trial. RESULTS: Pre-clinical  results showed successful ablation at various steering angles with reasonable  targeting accuracy and no off-target heating. During the pilot clinical study,  effective fibroid ablation was achieved with significant symptom reduction  observed over time. In general, the treatment results showed the system to be  effective in ablating deep tissue volumes. The device was successful at  efficiently ablating large volumes with minimal near-field heating and  eliminating the need for mechanical translation.

An increasing body of research has identified mechanosensitive ion  channels that can be modulated by FUS and support acute electrical activity in  neurons. However, neuromodulatory effects that persist from hours to days have  also been reported. The brain's ability to provide targeted blood flow to  electrically active regions involve a multitude of non-neuronal cell types and  signaling pathways in the cerebral vasculature; an open question is whether  persistent effects can be attributed, at least partly, to vascular mechanisms.  Using a novel in vivo optical approach, we found that microvascular responses,  unlike larger vessels which prior investigations have explored, exhibit  persistent dilation. This finding and approach offers a heretofore unseen aspect  of the effects of FUS in vivo and indicate that concurrent changes in  neurovascular function may partially underly persistent neuromodulatory effects.","2024-02-09","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: bioRxiv Pages: 2024.02.08.579513 Publication Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology PMID: 38370686  PMCID: PMC10871316","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Images obtained immediately following MRgFUS ablation were inputs for voxel-wise  supervised learning classifiers, trained using registered histology as a label  for thermal necrosis. METHODS: VX2 tumors in New Zealand white rabbits quadriceps  were thermally ablated using an MRgFUS system under 3 T MRI guidance. Animals  were re-imaged three days post-ablation and euthanized. Histological necrosis  labels were created by 3D registration between MR images and digitized H&E  segmentations of thermal necrosis to enable voxel-wise classification of  necrosis. Supervised MPMR classifier inputs included maximum temperature rise,  cumulative thermal dose (CTD), post-FUS differences in T2-weighted images, and  apparent diffusion coefficient, or ADC, maps. A logistic regression, support  vector machine, and random forest classifier were trained in red a leave-one-out  strategy in test data from four subjects. RESULTS: In the validation dataset, the  MPMR classifiers achieved higher recall and Dice than a clinically adopted 240  cumulative equivalent minutes at 43 (°)C (CEM (43)) threshold (0.43) in all  subjects. The average Dice scores of overlap with the registered histological  label for the logistic regression (0.63) and support vector machine (0.63) MPMR  classifiers were within 6% of the acute contrast-enhanced non-perfused volume  (0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Voxel-wise registration of MPMR data to histological  outcomes facilitated supervised learning of an accurate non-contrast MR biomarker  for MRgFUS ablations in a rabbit VX2 tumor model.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","355-366","","1","71","","IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37556341  PMCID: PMC10768718","","","","*Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; *Neoplasms; Animals; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Humans; Necrosis; Rabbits; Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, rodent subcutaneous and brain tumor models  were used to evaluate the treatment effect of both 5-ALA- and  fluorescein-mediated SDT. The subcutaneous tumor growth rates of both SDT groups  were significantly inhibited compared with that of the control groups. For  intracranial tumors, 5-ALA-SDT treatment significantly inhibited brain tumor  growth, while fluorescein-SDT exerted no therapeutic effect in animals. The  distribution of fluorescein in the brain tumor region underwent further  assessment. Seven days post tumor implantation, experimental animals received  fluorescein and were sacrificed for brain specimen collection. Analysis of the  dissected brains revealed no fluorescence signals, indicating an absence of  fluorescein accumulation in the early-stage glioma tissue. These data suggest  that the fluorescein-SDT treatment response is closely related to the amount of  accumulated fluorescein. This study reports the equivalent effects of 5-ALA and  fluorescein on the treatment of somatic tumors. For orthotopic brain tumor  models, tumor vascular permeability should be considered when choosing  fluorescein as a sonosensitizer. In conclusion, both fluorescein and 5-ALA are  safe and effective SDT sonosensitizers, and the tumor microenvironment and  pathologic type should be considered in the selection of adequate  sonosensitizers.","2024-01-05","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","2","16","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38254744  PMCID: PMC10813429","","","","5-ALA; brain tumor; fluorescein; focused ultrasound; sonodynamic therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, determining the  temperature in a region of interest in real-time is a subject of high interest.  Although this is still an open problem, in the field of ultrasound analysis, the  use of machine learning as a tool for both imaging and automated diagnostics are  application trends. In this work, a data-driven approach is proposed to address  the problem of estimating the temperature in regions of a B-mode ultrasound image  as a supervised learning problem. The proposal consists in presenting a novel  data modeling for the problem that includes information retrieved from  conventional B-mode ultrasound images and a parametric image built based on  changes in backscattered energy (CBE). Then, we compare the performance of  classic models in the literature. The computational results presented that, in a  simulated scenario, the proposed approach that a Gradient Boosting model would be  able to estimate the temperature with a mean absolute error of around 0.5°C,  which is acceptable in practical environments both in physiotherapic treatments  and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","3-16","","1","46","","Ultrason Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38041411","","","","*Temperature; B-mode images; Humans; Ultrasonography/methods; machine learning; supervised learning; temperature estimation; ultrasound imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The acoustic streaming behavior in brain tissue is difficult to model  numerically and thus warrants an in vitro examination of the effects of using  different sonication parameters, in terms of frequency, intensity, and pulse  duration (PD). METHODS: Melamine and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) foams were used to  mimic the porous brain tissue, which contains leptomeningeal fenestrations and  perivascular space, while agar hydrogel was used to emulate denser neuropil. FUS  was delivered to these media, which were immersed in a phosphate-buffered saline  containing toluidine blue O dye, across various frequencies (400, 500, and 600  kHz; applicable to transcranial delivery) in a pulsed mode at two different  spatialpeak pulse-average intensities (3 and 4 W/cm2). RESULTS: Image analysis  showed that the use of 400 kHz yielded the greatest dye infiltration in melamine  foam, while sonication had no impact on infiltration in the agar hydrogel due to  the dominance of diffusional transport. Using a fixed spatial-peak  temporal-average intensity of 0.4 W/cm2 at 400 kHz, a PD of 75 ms resulted in the  greatest infiltration depth in both melamine and PVA foams among the tested range  (50-150 ms). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the existence of a specific  frequency and PD that induce greater enhancement of solute/fluid movement, which  may contribute to eventual in vivo applications in promoting waste clearance from  the brain.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","35-46","","1","43","","Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Korea (South) PMID: 38029736  PMCID: PMC10766883","","","","Alzheimer’s disease; Bulk flow; Glymphatic; Phantom; Radiation force","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transcranial Focused Ultrasound (TFUS) has been examined as a way to stimulate  non-invasively, but previous studies have limitations in the application of TFUS.  As a result, refinement is needed to improve stimulation results. NEW METHOD: We  utilized a custom-built capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT)  that would send ultrasonic waves through skin and skull to targets located in the  Frontal Eye Fields (FEF) region triangulated from co-registered MRI and CT scans  while a non-human primate subject was performing a discrimination behavioral  task. RESULTS: We observed that the stimulation immediately caused changes in the  local field potential (LFP) signal that continued until stimulation ended, at  which point there was higher voltage upon the cue for the animal to saccade. This  co-incided with increases in activity in the alpha band during stimulation. The  activity rebounded mid-way through our electrode-shank, indicating a specific  point of stimulation along the shank. We observed different LFP signals for  different stimulation targets, indicating the ability to""steer"" the stimulation  through the transducer. We also observed a bias in first saccades towards the  opposite direction. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we provide a new approach for  non-invasive stimulation during performance of a behavioral task. With the  ability to steer stimulation patterns and target using a large amount of  transducers, the ability to provide non-invasive stimulation will be greatly  improved for future clinical and research applications.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","110009","","","402","","J Neurosci Methods","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The success of the treatment greatly depends on  achieving precise and efficient intraoperative focus. However, compensating for  aberrated ultrasound waves caused by the skull through numerical simulation-based  phase corrections is a challenging task due to the significant computational  burden involved in solving the acoustic wave equation. In this article, we  propose a promising strategy using the coupling of the boundary integral equation  method (BIEM) and the finite element method (FEM) to overcome the above  limitation. Specifically, we adopt the BIEM to obtain the Robin-to-Dirichlet maps  on the boundaries of the skull and then couple the maps to the FEM matrices via a  dual interpolation technique, resulting in a computational domain including only  the skull. Three simulation experiments were conducted to evaluate the  effectiveness of the proposed method, including a convergence test and two  skull-induced aberration corrections in 2D and 3D ultrasound. The results show  that the method's convergence is guaranteed as the element size decreases,  leading to a decrease in pressure error. The computation times for simulating a  500 kHz ultrasound field on a regular desktop computer were found to be  0.47 ± 0.01 s in the 2D case and 43.72 ± 1.49 s in the 3D case, provided that  lower-upper decomposition (approximately 13 s in 2D and 2.5 h in 3D) was  implemented in advance. We also demonstrated that more accurate transcranial  focusing can be achieved by phase correction compared to the noncorrected results  (with errors of 1.02 mm vs. 6.45 mm in 2D and 0.28 mm vs. 3.07 mm in 3D). The  proposed strategy is valuable for enabling online ultrasound simulations during  treatment, facilitating real-time adjustments and interventions.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","107181","","","137","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is limited research related to bone injury.  Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential factors  influencing unintentional pelvic bone injury after HIFU ablation of uterine  fibroids with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: A total of 635 patients  with fibroids treated with HIFU in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing  Medical University were enrolled. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced MRI  (CE-MRI) pre- and post-HIFU. Based on the post-treatment MRI, the patients were  divided into two groups: pelvic bone injury group and non-injury group, while the  specific site of pelvic bone injury of each patient was recorded. The univariate  and multivariate analyses were used to assess the correlations between the  factors of fibroid features and treatment parameters and pelvic bone injury, and  to further analyze the factors influencing the site of injury. RESULTS: Signal  changes in the pelvis were observed on CE-MRI in 51% (324/635) of patients after  HIFU. Among them, 269 (42.4%) patients developed sacral injuries and 135 (21.3%)  had pubic bone injuries. Multivariate analyses showed that patients with higher  age [P=0.003; odds ratio (OR), 1.692; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.191-2.404],  large anterior side-to-skin distance of fibroid (P<0.001; OR, 2.297; 95% CI:  1.567-3.365), posterior wall fibroid (P=0.006; OR, 1.897; 95% CI: 1.204-2.989),  hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI, P=0.003; OR, 2.125; 95% CI:  1.283-3.518), and large therapeutic dose (TD, P<0.001; OR, 3.007; 95% CI:  2.093-4.319) were at higher risk of postoperative pelvic bone injury. Further  analysis of the factors influencing the site of the pelvic bone injury showed  that some of the fibroid features and treatment parameters were associated with  it. Moreover, some postoperative pain-related adverse events were associated with  the pelvic bone injury. CONCLUSIONS: Post-HIFU treatment, patients may experience  pelvic injuries to the sacrum, pubis, or a combination of both, and some of them  experienced adverse events. Some fibroid features and treatment parameters are  associated with the injury. Taking its influencing factors into full  consideration preoperatively, slowing down treatment, and prolonging  intraoperative cooling phase can help optimize treatment decisions for HIFU.","2024-01-03","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","179-193","","1","14","","Quant Imaging Med Surg","","","","","","","","eng","2024 Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound  (MRgFUS) is a novel and promising non-invasive treatment for ET which offers  instantaneous results. METHODS: Using interpretative phenomenological analysis we  explored the experience of undergoing MRgFUS in six ET patients as well as their  experiences pre- and post-procedure. RESULTS: One-time, retrospective  semi-structured interviews were conducted and six themes emerged: Life  pre-treatment: ""It's everyday tasks that get you down"" and ""Most people who  understand, they are okay. Some people aren't""; MRgFUS: Treatment day: ""Going  into the unknown"" and ""There's no way I was going to press that button""; and Life  post-treatment: ""One is good. Two is better"" and ""Am I fixed, am I better now?.""  DISCUSSION: The findings point to a significant period of adjustment associated  with living with ET and the effects of undergoing ET MRgFUS treatment. As ET  progressed, participants struggled to cope with increasing symptoms and had to  develop coping strategies to manage life with ET. The procedure itself was  perceived as strange and extraordinary and despite some immediate adverse effects  participants were determined to go through with it. Post procedure, all  participants reported tremor suppression which was life changing. While some  participants still felt burdened by ET, others expressed it took them a while to  psychologically adjust to what essentially was their new body. This study has  highlighted the need for patients to be supported at all stages of their ET  journey.","2024","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","1352581","","","15","","Front Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 Stoycheva, Jameel, Bain, Nandi, Jones, Honeyfield, Gedroyc and Moore.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38390595  PMCID: PMC10882628","","","","MR-guided focused ultrasound; essential tremor; interpretative phenomenological analysis; patient experience; patient perspective","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Histotripsy is a cavitation-based ultrasound ablation method in development for multiple clinical applications. This work investigates the  effects of pulse repetition frequency (PRF) on bubble cloud characteristics and  ablative capabilities for histotripsy using single-cycle pulsing  methods.Approach.Bubble clouds produced by a 500 kHz histotripsy system at PRFs  from 0.1 to 1000 Hz were visualized using high-speed optical imaging in 1%  agarose tissue phantoms at peak negative pressures,p-, of 2-36 MPa.Main  results.Results showed a decrease in the cavitation cloud threshold with  increasing PRF, ranging from 26.7 ± 0.5 MPa at 0.1 Hz to 15.0 ± 1.9 MPa at 1000  Hz. Bubble cloud analysis showed cavitation clouds generated at low PRFs (0.1-1  Hz) were characterized by consistently dense bubble clouds (41.7 ± 2.8 bubbles  mm(-2)at 0.1 Hz), that closely matched regions of the focus above the histotripsy  intrinsic threshold. Bubble clouds formed at higher PRFs measured lower cloud  densities (23.1 ± 4.0 bubbles mm(-2)at 1000 Hz), with the lowest density measured  for 10 Hz (8.8 ± 4.1 bubbles mm(-2)). Furthermore, higher PRFs showed increased  pulse-to-pulse correlation, characteristic of cavitation memory effects; however,  bubble clouds still filled the entire volume of the focus due to their initial  density and enhanced bubble expansion from the restimulation of residual nuclei  at the higher PRFs. Histotripsy ablation assessed through lesion analysis in red  blood cell (RBC) phantoms showed higher PRFs generated lesions with lower  adherence to the initial focal region compared to low PRF ablations; however, no  trend of decreasing ablation efficiency with PRF was observed, with similar  efficiencies observed for all the PRFs tested in this study.Significance.Notably,  this result is different than what has previously been shown for shock-scattering  histotripsy, which has shown decreased ablation efficiencies at higher PRFs.  Overall, this study demonstrates the essential effects of PRF on single-cycle  histotripsy procedures that should be considered to help guide future histotripsy  pulsing strategies.","2024-01-12","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","2","69","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Creative Commons Attribution license.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38041873","","","","*Ablation Techniques; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Lithotripsy/methods; Phantoms, Imaging; Ultrasonography; cavitation; focused ultrasound; histotripsy; pulse repetition frequency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However,  limitations of conventional HIFU still remain. That is, genes are required to  cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in order to reach the neurological disordered  lesion. In this study, we introduce a novel direct intracranial gene delivery  method, bypassing the BBB using human serum albumin-based nanobubbles (NBs)  injected through a less invasive intrathecal route via lumbar puncture, followed  by intracranial irradiation with low-frequency ultrasound (LoFreqUS). Focusing on  both plasmid DNA (pDNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA), our approach utilizes LoFreqUS  for deeper tissue acoustic penetration and enhancing gene transfer efficiency.  This drug delivery method could be dubbed as the ""Spinal Back-Door Approach"", an  alternative to the ""front door"" BBB opening method. Experiments showed that NBs  effectively responded to LoFreqUS, significantly improving gene transfer in vitro  using U-87 MG cell lines. In vivo experiments in mice demonstrated significantly  increased gene expression with pDNA; however, we were unable to obtain conclusive  results using mRNA. This novel technique, combining albumin-based NBs and  LoFreqUS offers a promising, efficient, targeted, and non-invasive solution for  central nervous system gene therapy, potentially transforming the treatment  landscape for neurological disorders.","2024-01-30","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","3","14","","Nanomaterials (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38334557  PMCID: PMC10856598","","","","central nervous system; drug delivery system; low-frequency ultrasound; nanobubble","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to examine the involvement of connector hub  regions in essential tremor. METHODS: We examined whole-brain functional  connectivity alterations across multiple brain networks in 27 patients with  essential tremor and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls to identify  affected hub regions using a network metric called functional connectivity  overlap ratio estimated from resting-state functional MRI. We also evaluated the  relationships of affected hubs with cognitive and tremor scores in all patients  and with motor function improvement scores in 15 patients who underwent  postoperative follow-up evaluations after focused ultrasound thalamotomy.  RESULTS: We have identified affected connector hubs in the cerebellum and  thalamus. Specifically, the dentate nucleus in the cerebellum and the dorsomedial  thalamus exhibited more extensive connections with the sensorimotor network in  patients. Moreover, the connections of the thalamic pulvinar with the visual  network were also significantly widespread in the patient group. The connections  of these connector hub regions with cognitive networks were negatively associated  (FDR q < 0.05) with cognitive, tremor, and motor function improvement scores.  CONCLUSION: In patients with essential tremor, connector hub regions within the  cerebellum and thalamus exhibited widespread functional connections with  sensorimotor and visual networks, leading to alternative pathways outside the  classical tremor axis. Their connections with cognitive networks also affect  patients' cognitive function.","2024-02-14","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","106034","","","121","","Parkinsonism Relat Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

All  transducers operate at 12 MHz at third harmonic frequency, having an outer  diameter of 20 mm, a central hole of 5 mm in diameter, and a radius of curvature  of 15 mm. The electroacoustic efficiency determined by a radiation force balance  is evaluated in a range of input power levels up to 15 W. Schlieren tomography as  well as hydrophone measurements are used for evaluation of the acoustic field  distribution. It is found that the average electroacoustic efficiency of  NBT-based transducers is approximately 40%, while it is around 80% in the  PZT-based devices. NBT devices show significantly higher inhomogeneity of the  acoustic field under schlieren tomography compared to PZT devices. From pressure  measurements in the prefocal plane, it was found that the inhomogeneity could be  attributed to depoling of significant areas of the NBT piezo-component during the  fabrication process. In conclusion, PZT-based devices performed significantly  better than those using lead-free material. However, the NBT devices show promise  for this application and their electroacoustic efficiency as well as the  uniformity of the acoustic field could be improved by employing a low-temperature  fabrication process or repoling after processing.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","16-26","","1","71","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37028298","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: A total of 123 patients were  enrolled in the injury group. In contrast, 246 patients without thermal injury  were assigned to the non-injury group. The relationship between patient and  treatment parameters and injury were explored using univariate analysis and  multiple logistic regression analyses. In addition, the factors influencing the  degree of thermal injury were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis H. RESULTS: (1)  Abdominal scars (p = .007, OR = 2.187, 95% CI: 1.242-3.849), abdominal wall  thickness (p < .001, OR = 1.042, 95% CI: 1.019-1.067), fundus fibroids (p = .038,  OR = 1.790, 95% CI: 1.033-3.100), UFs with hyperintense/mixed T2-weighted imaging  (T2WI) signals (p = .022, OR = 1.843, 95% CI: 1.091-3.115), average sonication  power (AP) (p = .025, OR = 1.021, 95% CI: 1.003-1.039), and treatment time (TT)  (p < .001, OR = 1.017, 95% CI: 1.011-1.023) were independent risk factors for  thermal injury, while treatment volume (TV) (p = .002, OR = 0.775, 95% CI:  0.661-0.909) was a protective factor for injury. (2) Four groups were subdivided  according to the degree of thermal injury(Group A: without skin injury. Group B:  with changed T2WI signal in the abdominal wall, Group C: mild skin injury, Group  D: severe skin injury), comparison of each with every other showed that the  abdominal wall in Groups A and D was thinner than Groups B and C, with  statistically significant differences (P(AB)<0.05, P(AC)<0.01, P(DC)<0.05,  P(DB)<0.05); Group A was slightly thicker than D, however, without statistical  difference. The ratio of sonication time (ST) to TV in Group A was the lowest of  all (P(AB), P(AC), P(AD) all < 0.05). And as the level of thermal injury rose,  the ratio gradually increased, however, without statistical difference.  CONCLUSIONS: Based on our limited results, the following conclusion was made. (1)  Abdominal scars, abdominal wall thickness, fundus fibroids, UFs with T2WI  hyperintense/mixed signals, AP and TT were independent risk factor. (2) Neither  too thick nor too thin abdominal walls would be recommended, as both might  increase the risk of skin injury.

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS:  Several classifications based on MRI have been proposed, and their phenotypes are  reported to be associated with the severity of adenomyosis. However, a consensus  classification based on MRI findings has not yet been reached. Our study was  designed to retrospectively analyze data from a cohort of patients in the  Affiliated Nanchong Central Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College from June  2017 to December 2021 before focused ultrasound ablation surgery (FUAS), to  identify the optimal classification of adenomyosis severity from different  classification criteria and explore factors associated with the presence of  symptoms. METHODS: The proportions of disease severity among different  classification groups were compared to obtain the one generating the most  considerable chi-square value, which was identified as the optimal classification  for informing disease severity. A logistic regression model was constructed to  explore factors associated with disease severity. RESULTS: Classification of  Kobayashi H (classification 4) concerning the affected areas and size (volumes of  lesions) was recognized as the optimal one, which identified dysmenorrhea  (χ2=18.550, p-value=0.002) and menorrhagia (χ2=15.060, p-value=0.010) secondary  to adenomyosis. For volumes of uterine wall <2/3, the dysmenorrhea rate in  subtype-4 was higher than that in subtype-1 (χ2=4.114, p-value=0.043), and the  dysmenorrhea rate in subtype-5 was higher than that in subtype-2 (χ2=4.357,  p-value=0.037).

Concerning volumes of uterine wall ≥2/3, the menorrhagia rate in  subtype-3 remarkably increased compared with that in subtype-6 (χ2=9.776,  p-value=0.002), and internal phenotype was identified as an independent factor  associated with menorrhagia (OR=1.706, 95%CI=1.131～2.573, p-value=0.011).

The directivity of  modulation is empirically regulated by modifying the stimulation length,  interval, and strength. However, bidirectional neuronal modulations using  ultrasound stimulations are rarely reported. This study presents bidirectional  control of epileptiform activities with repetitive transcranial-focused  ultrasound stimulations in a rat model of drug-induced acute epilepsy. It is  found that repeated transmission of elongated (40 s), ultra-low pressure  (0.25 MPa) ultrasound can fully suppress epileptic activities in  electro-encephalography and cerebral blood volume measurements, while the change  in bursting intervals from 40 to 20 s worsens epileptic activities even with the  same burst length. Furthermore, the suppression induced by 40 s long bursts is  transformed to excitatory states by a subsequent transmission. Bidirectional  modulation of epileptic seizures with repeated ultrasound stimulation is achieved  by regulating the changes in glutamate and γ-Aminobutyric acid levels, as  confirmed by measurements of expressed c-Fos and GAD65 and multitemporal analysis  of neurotransmitters in the interstitial fluid obtained via microdialysis.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","e2302404","","2","11","","Adv Sci (Weinh)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

We have developed a  device that addresses these practical requirements. The device delivers  ultrasound through the temporal and parietal skull windows, which minimize the  attenuation and distortions of the ultrasound by the skull. The device consists  of 252 independently controlled elements, which provides the ability to modulate  multiple deep brain targets at a high spatiotemporal resolution, without the need  to move the device or the subject. And finally, the device uses a mechanical  registration method that enables accurate deep brain targeting both inside and  outside of the MRI. Using this method, a single MRI scan is necessary for  accurate targeting; repeated subsequent treatments can be performed reproducibly  in an MRI-free manner. We validated these functions by transiently modulating  specific deep brain regions in two patients with treatment-resistant depression.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","660-668","","2","71","","IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37695955  PMCID: PMC10803076","","","","*Brain/diagnostic imaging; *Skull/diagnostic imaging; Acoustics; Head; Humans; Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vascular malformations are divided into  high-flow (arteriovenous malformation) and low-flow (venous malformations and  lymphatic malformations). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard for  pre-and post-intervention assessments, while ultrasound (US), X-ray fluoroscopy  and computed tomography (CT) are used for intra-procedural guidance.  Sclerotherapy, an image-guided therapy that involves the injection of a  sclerosant directly into the malformation, is typically the first-line therapy  for treating low-flow vascular malformations. Sclerotherapy induces endothelial  damage and necrosis/fibrosis with eventual involution of the malformation.  Image-guided thermal therapies involve freezing or heating target tissue to  induce cell death and necrosis. MRI is an alternative for intra-procedural  guidance and monitoring during the treatment of vascular malformations. MR can  provide dynamic, multiplanar imaging that delineates surrounding critical  structures such as nerves and vasculature. Multiple studies have demonstrated  that MR-guided treatment of vascular malformations is safe and effective. This  review will detail (1) the use of MR for the classification and diagnosis of  vascular malformations, (2) the current literature surrounding MR-guided  treatment of vascular malformations, (3) a series of cases of MR-guided  sclerotherapy and thermal ablation for the treatment of vascular malformations,  and (4) a discussion of technologies that may potentiate interventional MRI  adoption including high intensity focused ultrasound and guided laser ablation.","2024","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","1319046","","","11","","Front Med (Lausanne)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 Bailey, Herrera, Neumeister and Weiss.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38420359  PMCID: PMC10899448","","","","MRI guidance; ablation; cryoablation; interventional MRI; laser; low flow vascular malformations; sclerotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: One hundred sixty patients with localized prostate cancer were treated  with minimally invasive methods (53, 52, 55 patients with cryoablation,  brachytherapy and HIFU therapy, respectively). Prostate-specific antigen and  evaluation of post-procedure biopsies were used as an assessment. The review of  functional indicators and quality of life was made with International Index of  Erectile Function (IIEF-5), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), maximum  urinary flow rate (Qmax), quality of life (QoL) questionnaires. RESULTS: Patients  after cryoablation showed worse results of oncological control according to  positive repeat biopsies, best indicators were observed after brachytherapy. When  considering the IPSS results, there were statistically significantly worse scores  in the brachytherapy group in the early postoperative period, these differences  do not reach statistical significance in the late period in the brachytherapy and  cryoablation groups. Patients in the cryoablation group showed worse indicators  of IIEF-5; in the early postoperative period; in the late follow-up period, the  indicators of erectile function in patients in the cryoablation group did not  statistically significantly differ from those in patients after brachytherapy.  Patients after HIFU therapy showed fewer cases of de novo erectile dysfunction  during the follow-up period of 3 years, higher average IIEF-5 scores, lower IPSS  scores and better QoL results. CONCLUSION: The recurrence of prostate cancer was  statistically significantly higher in the International Society of Urological  Pathology (ISUP) 3 grade group. HIFU therapy had better urination indicators  compared to other groups, that can be associated with the laser enucleation of  prostatic hyperplasia. The advantage was noted in patients after HIFU therapy  when comparing the parameters to the IIEF-5 thus, HIFU treatment had a better  impact on patients' QoL with localized prostate cancer.","2024-01-21","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","3915603231226366","","","","","Urologia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38247121","","","","Brachytherapy; cryoablation; high-intensity focused ultrasound; prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simulated power  deposition patterns were converted to temperature maps using a Pennes' bioheat  equation-based thermal solver. Agreement of pressure between the simulation  techniques and temperature between the simulation and experimental heating was  evaluated. Contributions of scattering and absorption attenuation were  considered. RESULTS: Simulated peak pressures derived using the HAS method  exceeded the simulated peak pressures from k-Wave by 1.6 ± 2.7%. The location and  FWHM of the peak pressure calculated from HAS and k-Wave showed good agreement.  When muscle acoustic absorption value in the simulations was adjusted to  approximately 54% of the measured attenuation, the average root-mean-squared  error between simulated and experimental spatial-average temperature profiles was  0.046 ± 0.019 °C/W. Mean distance between simulated and experimental COTMs was  3.25 ± 1.37 mm. Transverse FWHMs of simulated sonications were smaller than in  in vivo sonications. Longitudinal FWHMs were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Presented  results demonstrate agreement between HAS and k-Wave simulations and that FUS  simulations can accurately predict focal position and heating for in vivo  applications in soft tissue.","2024","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","2301489","","1","41","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38234019  PMCID: PMC10903184","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; Acoustic modeling; Acoustics; Animals; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Rabbits; Temperature; high-intensity focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, achieving precise  spatiotemporal control of immune cell activation in LN in vivo remains a  challenge due to tissue depth and off-target effects. Furthermore, minimally  invasive and real-time feedback methods to monitor the regulation of the immune  system in LN are lacking. Here, focused ultrasound responsive immunomodulator  loaded nanoplatform (FURIN) with near-infrared II (NIR-II) luminescence is  designed to achieve spatiotemporally controllable immune activation in LN  in vivo. The NIR-II persistent luminescence of FURIN can track its delivery in LN  through bioimaging. Under focused ultrasound (FUS) stimulation, the  immunomodulator encapsulated in FURIN can be released locally in the LN to  activate immune cells such as dendritic cells and the NIR-II mechanoluminescence  of FURIN provides real-time optical feedback signals for immune activation. This  work points to a FUS mediated, spatiotemporal selective immune activation  strategy in vivo with the feedback control of luminescence signals via ultrasound  responsive nanocomposite, which is of great significance in improving the  efficacy and reducing the side effect of immune regulation for the development of  potential immunotherapeutic methods in the future.","2024-01-30","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","e202304066","","","","","Chemistry","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 38289154","","","","focused ultrasound; immune regulation; lymph node; mechanoluminescence; near-infrared II","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This transducer involves a back-reflector, which  is modeled after tapetum lucidum in the eyes of some nocturnal animals. The  bionic structure reflects the ultrasound, which passes through the PVDF membrane,  back to PVDF and provides a second chance for the PVDF to convert the ultrasound  to electric signals. This design increases the amount of ultrasound absorbed by  the PVDF, thereby improving the detection sensitivity. Both ultrasonic and  photoacoustic (PA) experiments were conduct to characterize the performance of  the transducer. The results show that the fabricated transducer has a center  frequency of 13.07 MHz, and a bandwidth of 96% at -6 dB. With an acoustic  numerical aperture (NA) of 0.64, the transducer provides a lateral resolution of  140µm.

In adult women with endometriosis,  significant delays in diagnosis and medical or surgical treatment have been  described. Our study aimed to investigate the delay in diagnosis and treatment of  adolescents and young women with suspected endometriosis. METHODS: A  retrospective study of adolescents and young women (12-22 years-old) who were  evaluated for suspected endometriosis at the endometriosis clinic in the Shamir  medical center between January 2017 and December 2022. All patients were referred  by their primary care gynecologists. The evaluation in the endometriosis clinic  included targeted history, physical exam and a focused ultrasound survey for  endometriosis (performed trans-abdominally in all cases, and trans-vaginally in  sexually active women). RESULTS: Out of 400 women with suspected endometriosis  evaluated in our endometriosis clinic during the study period, 68 were  adolescents and young women <22 years old. Their mean age at time of evaluation  for endometriosis was 18 ± 2.5 years, and the mean time-period from onset of  symptoms to the endometriosis evaluation was 4.0 ± 2.9 years. Their most common  symptoms were dysmenorrhea (in 61 cases, 89.7 %), followed by gastrointestinal  symptoms (in 32 cases, 47.1 %). In 30 (44.1 %) cases, hormonal treatment was  prescribed by the primary care gynecologist prior to their appointment in the  endometriosis clinic. On comparison of patients with delay of <4 years (N = 31)  versus ≥4 years (N = 37) from symptom onset to the endometriosis evaluation,  patients with shorter duration of symptoms were more likely to decline any  hormonal treatment for endometriosis while patients with longer duration of  symptoms were more likely to accept the recommendation for hormonal treatment  (16.2 % versus 0 %, p = 0.02, and 83.8 % versus 100 %, p = 0.03, respectively).  CONCLUSION: Adolescents and young women with suspected endometriosis may  experience significant delays in diagnosis and medical care, similar to adult  patients.","2024-03","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","102737","","3","53","","J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.

METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was  conducted in Nanchong Central Hospital, recruiting a total of 672 patients with  UFs undergoing HIFU from June 2017 to December 2019. Using univariate and  multivariate logistic regression, risk factors for re-intervention were assessed.  RESULTS: Among 401 patients with UFs who completed the follow-up visits (median  47 months, range 34-61), 50 (12.46%) patients underwent re-intervention (such as  high-intensity focused ultrasound, uterine artery embolization, myomectomy and  hysterectomy). In the different age distributions, the re-intervention rate was  17.5% (34/194) in patients aged <45 years and 7.7% (16/207) in those aged  ≥45 years. Regarding the younger patient group (aged <45 years), hypo- or  iso-intensive fibroids in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T2WI) intensity  may elevate the risk of re-intervention for UFs (odds ratio [OR] 2.96, 95%  confidence interval [CI] 1.37-6.62; P = 0.007).

It is under investigation to treat a number of  ailments, including renal tumors. Ultrasound imaging is used to monitor  histotripsy, though there remains a lack of definitive imaging metrics to confirm  successful treatment outcomes. In this study, a convolutional neural network  (CNN) was developed to segment ablation on ultrasound images. METHODS: A transfer  learning approach was used to replace classification layers of the residual  network ResNet-18. Inputs to the classification layers were based on imaging  assessment of red blood cell phantoms that were ablated by histotripsy ablation,  including ultrasound images and digital photographs that served as the ground  truth. The efficacy of the CNN was compared to subtraction imaging, and manual  segmentation of images by two board-certified radiologists. RESULTS: The CNN had  a similar performance to manual segmentation, though was improved relative to  segmentation with subtraction imaging. Predictions of the network improved over  the course of treatment, with the Dice similarity coefficient less than 20% for  fewer than 500 applied pulses, but 85% for more than 750 applied pulses. The  network was also applied to ultrasound images of ex vivo kidney exposed to  histotripsy, which indicated a morphological shift in the treatment profile  relative to the phantoms. These findings were consistent with histology that  confirmed ablation of the targeted tissue. CONCLUSION: Overall, the CNN showed  promise as a rapid means to assess outcomes of histotripsy and automate  treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: Data collected in this study indicate integration of CNN  image segmentation to gauge outcomes for histotripsy ablation holds promise for  automating treatment procedures.","2024-01-10","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","PP","","IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38198256","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RECENT FINDINGS: BBB disruption is becoming increasingly common in  the treatment of primary brain tumors. Use of mannitol in BBB disruption for  targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics via superselective intra-arterial cerebral  infusion (SIACI) is the most utilized strategy to modify the BBB. Mannitol is  used in conjunction with chemotherapeutics, oligonucleotides, and other active  agents. Convection-enhanced delivery has become an attractive option for  therapeutic delivery while bypassing the BBB. Other technologic innovations  include laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) and focused ultrasound (FUS)  which have emerged as prime modalities to directly target tumors and cause  significant local BBB disruption.

METHODS: Case records of patients aged < 40 years who were  treated for cervical HSILs using either FUS or LEEP from September 1, 2020 to May  31, 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were followed up for cure,  recurrence, human papillomavirus (HPV) clearance, and complications within 1 year  of treatment. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were determined using  univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to analyze the association  between disease evidence or HPV clearance and treatment modalities or other  covariates. RESULTS: Of the 1,054 women who underwent FUS or LEEP, 225 met our  selection criteria. Among the selected women, 101 and 124 received FUS and LEEP,  respectively.

Current non-drug therapies like transcranial  direct-current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation have limitations  due to their invasive nature and limited reach to deeper brain areas.  Transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) is gaining attention as a noninvasive  option with precise spatial targeting, able to affect deeper areas of the brain.  This research focused on assessing the effectiveness of FUS in influencing the  infralimbic cortex (IL) to prevent the recurrence of MA-seeking behavior, using  the conditioned place preference (CPP) method in rats. The study involved twenty  male Sprague-Dawley rats. Neuronal activation by FUS was first examined via  electromyography (EMG). Rats received alternately with MA or saline, and confined  to one of two distinctive compartments in a three compartment apparatus over a  4-day period. After CPP test, extinction, the first reinstatement, and extinction  again, FUS was applied to IL prior to the second MA priming-induced  reinstatement. Safety assessments were conducted through locomotor and  histological function examinations. EMG data confirmed the effectiveness of FUS  in activating neurons. Significant attenuation of reinstatement of MA CPP was  found, along with successful targeting of the IL region, confirmed through  acoustic field scanning, c-Fos immunohistochemistry, and Evans blue dye staining.  No damage to brain tissue or impaired locomotor activity was observed. The  results of the study indicate that applying FUS to the IL markedly reduced the  recurrence of MA seeking behavior, without harming brain tissue or impairing  motor skills. This suggests that FUS could be a promising method for treating MA  use disorder, with the infralimbic cortex being an effective target for FUS in  preventing MA relapse.","2024-02-13","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","e00328","","","","","Neurotherapeutics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

However, the water balloons  worsen the pathway for acoustic transmission, causing degraded performance both  in ultrasound therapy and in ultrasound imaging. This study was aimed at  establishing a protocol to evaluate the effects of the water balloon. METHODS:  Simulations and experiments were carefully conducted to quantitatively  investigate the effects of water ballons on the efficiency of HIFU energy  delivery and on the quality of ultrasound guiding images. More specifically,  HIFU-induced temperature increases in the focal region, together with spatial  resolution, contrast and signal-to-noise ratio in the ultrasound guiding images,  were compared under the conditions with and without the water balloon. RESULTS:  Experiment results revealed that the use of water balloons led to decreases in  temperature up to 10ºC within the focal region in some specific situations, but  the quality of the guiding images was relatively less affected. CONCLUSION: The  study provided knowledge on what influence the water balloon could have in  ultrasound-guided HIFU treatment; it also established a practical and  standardized evaluation scheme for further optimizing the water balloon, for  example, its material and internal liquid compositions.

Consequently, due to the drug's inability to effectively penetrate  the BBB, outcomes following brain chemotherapy continue to be suboptimal. Several  methods to open the BBB and obtain higher drug concentrations in tumors have been  proposed, with the selection of the optimal method depending on the size of the  targeted tumor volume, the chosen therapeutic agent, and individual patient  characteristics. Herein, we aim to comprehensively describe osmotic disruption  with intra-arterial drug administration, intrathecal/intraventricular  administration, laser interstitial thermal therapy, convection-enhanced delivery,  and ultrasound methods, including high-intensity focused and low-intensity  ultrasound as well as tumor-treating fields. We explain the scientific concept  behind each method, preclinical/clinical research, advantages and disadvantages,  indications, and potential avenues for improvement. Given that each method has  its limitations, it is unlikely that the future of BBB disruption will rely on a  single method but rather on a synergistic effect of a combined approach.  Disruption of the BBB with osmotic infusion or high-intensity focused ultrasound,  followed by the intra-arterial delivery of drugs, is a promising approach.  Real-time monitoring of drug delivery will be necessary for optimal results.","2024-01-04","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","1","16","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38201663  PMCID: PMC10778052","","","","blood–brain barrier; blood–tumor barrier; convection-enhanced delivery; focused ultrasound; laser interstitial thermal therapy; low-intensity pulsed ultrasound; osmotic disruption; tumor-treating fields","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Though a wide-array of  treatment options are available, they are often systemic and/or invasive. As a  promising neuromodulation treatment, Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a noninvasive  and highly spatially-targeted technique shown to stimulate neural activity, yet,  effects on pain signaling are currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: Develop and validate  a method for studying FUS nerve stimulation modulation of pain-evoked neural  responses in vivo. METHODS: We developed a high-resolution functional ultrasound  (fUS) method capable of mapping cortical responses in healthy and neuropathic  pain mice in response to FUS neuromodulation treatment. RESULTS: FUS-evoked  hemodynamic responses are correlated with the intensity of peripheral  neuromodulation. We confirm functional connectivity is altered in neuropathic  mice and demonstrate that FUS can modulate neuropathic pain-evoked hemodynamics.  CONCLUSIONS: The findings presented herein provides evidence for an FUS-based  nerve pain method and validates the fUS technique developed for monitoring  pain-evoked hemodynamics. SIGNIFICANCE: We anticipate that the findings presented  herein describe a noninvasive and flexible nerve modulation technique for pain  mitigation, furthering evidence for clinical translation.","2024-01-10","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","PP","","IEEE Trans Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38198257","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was  to set up a radiomics model based on MRI T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) for  predicting the efficacy of HIFU ablation in uterine fibroids, and it would be  used in preoperative screening of the fibroids for achieving high non-perfused  volume ratio (NPVR). METHODS: A total of 178 patients with uterine fibroids were  consecutively enrolled and treated with ultrasound-guided HIFU under conscious  sedation between February 2017 and December 2021. Among them, 96 patients with  108 uterine fibroids with high ablation efficacy (NPVR ≥80%, h_NPVR) and 82  patients with 92 fibroids with lower ablation efficacy (NPVR <80%, l_NPVR) were  retrospectively analyzed. The transverse T2WI images of fibroids were selected,  and the fibroids were delineated slice by slice using ITK-SNAP software. The  radiomics analysis was performed to find the imaging biomarker for the  construction of a predicting model for the evaluation of the ablation efficacy,  including the feature extraction, feature selection and model construction. The  prediction model was built by logistic regression and assessed by receiver  operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the prediction efficiency of the two  models was compared by Delong test. The ratio of the training set to the testing  set was 8:2. RESULTS: The logistic regression model showed that the mean area  under the curve (AUC) of the training set was 0.817 [95% confidence interval  (CI): 0.755-0.882], and the testing set was 0.805 (95% CI: 0.670-0.941),  respectively, which indicated a strong classification ability. The Delong test  showed that there was no significant difference in the area under the ROC curve  between the training set and testing set (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The radiomics  model based on T2WI is feasible and effective for predicting the efficacy of HIFU  ablation in treatment of uterine fibroids.","2024-02-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","1803-1819","","2","14","","Quant Imaging Med Surg","","","","","","","","eng","2024 Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

SDR values vary across the skull and the  mean value is known to be predictive of sonication thermal increase. The aim of  this investigation was to explore the effects of the SDR distribution on clinical  outcomes following treatment with MRgFUS. METHODS: Data from 61 patients with  essential or dystonic tremor treated with MRgFUS targeting the ventral  intermediate nucleus (Vim) were retrospectively analyzed. Tremor suppression was  assessed using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) and hand tremor score  (HTS). Vim ablation volume was measured on the T1-weighted MR image acquired both  at 1 day and 12 months after treatment. The numerical distribution of SDR values  measured for each element in the ultrasound transducer was quantified by  calculating the mean, standard deviation, skewness, entropy, and kurtosis of the  SDR histogram. The effect of the SDR metrics on change in CRST and HTS was  examined using a linear mixed-effects model. Additionally, the effect of the  regional distribution of SDR values was explored in an element-wise analysis  between patients with above- and below-average tremor suppression. RESULTS: A  significant positive effect was found between SDR kurtosis and improvement in  CRST (β = 0.33, p = 0.004) and HTS (β = 0.38, p < 0.001). The effect was found to  be significant at 1 month posttreatment (CRST: β = 0.415, p = 0.008; HTS: β =  0.369, p = 0.016), and at the most recent clinical follow-up (CRST: β = 0.395, p  < 0.001; HTS: β = 0.386, p < 0.001). One hundred seventy-one significant elements  were identified in the element-wise analysis. The mean percentage difference from  the mean SDR in these elements was associated with improvement in CRST (β = 0.27,  p < 0.008) and HTS (β = 0.27, p < 0.015). Higher SDR kurtosis was associated with  increased lesion volume at 12 months (p = 0.040) and less reduction in volume  relative to the day-1 lesion volume (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Greater SDR  kurtosis was associated with larger, more stable lesions at 12 months  posttreatment and increased tremor suppression at long-term follow-up. SDR  kurtosis may provide a more meaningful prognostic factor than the mean SDR.","2024-03-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","648-656","","3","140","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37657096","","","","*Head; *Tremor/diagnostic imaging/therapy; Humans; MRgFUS; Retrospective Studies; Skull; Ultrasonography; dystonic tremor; essential tremor; focused ultrasound; functional neurosurgery; skull density ratio; thalamotomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  anatomic segment of DRT fibers adjacent to the ventral intermediate nucleus of  the thalamus (VIM), referred to as the rubral wing (RW), may be directly  visualized on the fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery. We compared  reproducibility, lesion overlap, and clinical outcomes when reconstructing the  DRT tract using a novel anatomically defined RW region of interest, DRT-RW, to an  existing tractography method based on the posterior subthalamic area region of  interest (DRT-PSA). METHODS: We reviewed data of 23 patients with either  essential tremor (n = 18) or tremor-predominant Parkinson's disease (n = 5) who  underwent HIFU thalamotomy, targeting the VIM. DRT tractography, ipsilateral to  the lesion, was created based on either DRT-PSA or DRT-RW. Volume sections of  each tract were created and dice similarity coefficients were used to measure  spatial overlap between the 2 tractographies. Post-HIFU lesion size and location  (on postoperative T2 MRI) was correlated with tremor outcomes and side effects  for both DRT tractography methods and the RW itself. RESULTS: DRT-PSA passed  through the RW and DRT-RW intersected with the ROIs of the DRT-PSA in all 23  cases. A higher percentage of the RW was ablated in patients who achieved tremor  control (18.9%, 95% CI 15.1, 22.7) vs those without tremor relief (6.7%, 95% CI%  0, 22.4, P = .017). In patients with tremor control 6 months postoperatively (n =  12), those with side effects (n = 6) had larger percentages of their tracts  ablated in comparison with those without side effects in both DRT-PSA (44.8, 95%  CI 31.8, 57.8 vs 24.2%, 95% CI 12.4, 36.1, P = .025) and DRT-RW (35.4%, 95% CI  21.5, 49.3 vs 21.7%, 95% CI 12.7, 30.8, P = .030). CONCLUSION: Tractography of  the DRT could be reconstructed by direct anatomic visualization of the RW on fast  gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery-MRI. Anatomic planning is expected  to be quicker, more reproducible, and less operator-dependent.","2024-01-30","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","Oper Neurosurg (Hagerstown)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2024.

The fragmentation of stones by ultrasound has  applications in medical lithotripsy for the comminution of kidney stones or gall  stones, where their fragmentation is believed to result from the high acoustic  wave energy as well as the formation of cavitation. Cavitation is known to  contribute to erosion and to cause damage away from the target, yet the exact  contribution and mechanisms of cavitation remain currently unclear. Based on in  situ experimental observations, post-exposure microtomography and acoustic  simulations, the present work sheds light on the fundamental role of cavitation  bubbles in the stone surface fragmentation by correlating the detected damage to  the observed bubble activity. Our results show that not all clouds erode the  stone, but only those located in preferential nucleation sites whose locations  are herein examined. Furthermore, quantitative characterizations of the bubble  clouds and their trajectories within the ultrasonic field are discussed. These  include experiments with and without the presence of a model stone in the  acoustic path length. Finally, the optimal stone-to-source distance maximizing  the cavitation-induced surface damage area has been determined. Assuming the  pressure magnitude within the focal region to exceed the cavitation pressure  threshold, this location does not correspond to the acoustic focus, where the  pressure is maximal, but rather to the region where the acoustic beam and thereby  the acoustic cavitation activity near the stone surface is the widest.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","106738","","","102","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Recent studies have focused on glutamatergic signaling hypoactivity through  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS)  improves behavioral deficits and ameliorates neuropathology in dizocilpine  (MK-801)-treated rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of  LIPUS against psychiatric symptoms and anxiety-like behaviors. STUDY DESIGN: Rats  assigned to 4 groups were pretreated with or without LIPUS for 5 days. The open  field and prepulse inhibition tests were performed after saline or MK-801 (0.3  mg/kg) administration. Then, the neuroprotective effects of LIPUS on the  MK-801-treated rats were evaluated using western blotting and immunohistochemical  staining. STUDY RESULTS: LIPUS stimulation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)  prevented deficits in locomotor activity and sensorimotor gating and improved  anxiety-like behavior. MK-801 downregulated the expression of NR1, the NMDA  receptor, in rat medial PFC (mPFC). NR1 expression was significantly higher in  animals receiving LIPUS pretreatment compared to those receiving only MK-801. In  contrast, a significant increase in c-Fos-positive cells in the mPFC and ventral  tegmental area was observed in the MK-801-treated rats compared to those  receiving only saline; this change was suppressed by pretreatment with LIPUS.  CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new evidence for the role of LIPUS stimulation  in regulating the NMDA receptor and modulating c-Fos activity, which makes it a  potentially valuable antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia.","2024-01-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","120-131","","1","50","","Schizophr Bull","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2023.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 142  retrospective patients, the skeletal muscle index (SMI), skeletal muscle  radiodensity (SMRD), fatty muscle fraction (FMF), and intermuscular fat fraction  (IMFF) were determined on superior mesenteric artery level in pre-interventional  CT. Each marker was tested for associations with sex, age, body mass index (BMI),  and ECOG. The prognostic value of the markers was examined in Kaplan-Meier  analyses with the log-rank test and in uni- and multivariable Cox proportional  hazards (CPH) models. RESULTS: The following significant associations were  observed: Male patients had higher BMI and SMI. Patients with lower ECOG had  lower BMI and SMI. Patients with BMI lower than 21.8 kg/m(2) (median) also showed  lower SMI and IMFF. Patients younger than 63.3 years (median) were found to have  higher SMRD, lower FMF, and lower IMFF. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis,  significantly lower survival times were observed in patients with higher ECOG or  lower SMI. Increased patient risk was observed for higher ECOG, lower BMI, and  lower SMI in univariable CPH analyses for 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival.  Multivariable CPH analysis for 1-year survival revealed increased patient risk  for higher ECOG, lower SMI, lower IMFF, and higher FMF. In multivariable analysis  for 2- and 3-year survival, only ECOG and FMF remained significant. CONCLUSION:  CT-based markers of sarcopenia and myosteatosis show a prognostic value for  assessment of survival in advanced pancreatic cancer patients undergoing HIFU  therapy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The results indicate a greater role of  myosteatosis for additional risk assessment beyond clinical scores, as only FMF  was associated with long-term survival in multivariable CPH analyses along ECOG  and also showed independence to ECOG in group analysis. KEY POINTS: • This study  investigates the prognostic value of CT-based markers of sarcopenia and  myosteatosis for patients with pancreatic cancer treated with high-intensity  focused ultrasound. • Markers for sarcopenia and myosteatosis showed a prognostic  value besides clinical assessment of the physical status by the Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group score. In contrast to muscle size measurements, the  myosteatosis marker fatty muscle fraction demonstrated independence to the  clinical score. • The results indicate that myosteatosis might play a greater  role for additional patient risk assessments beyond clinical assessments of  physical status.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","279-286","","1","34","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Selection of lesion  location can be informed by considering optimal stimulation area from deep brain  stimulation (DBS). METHODS: 118 patients with ET who received DBS (39) or MRgFUS  (79) of the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) underwent stimulation/lesion  mapping, probabilistic mapping of clinical efficacy and normative structural  connectivity analysis. The efficacy maps were compared, which depict the  relationship between stimulation/lesion location and clinical outcome. RESULTS:  Efficacy maps overlap around the VIM ventral border and encompass the  dentato-rubro-thalamic tract. While the MRgFUS map extends inferiorly into the  posterior subthalamic area, the DBS map spreads inside the VIM antero-superiorly.  CONCLUSION: Comparing the efficacy maps of DBS and MRgFUS suggests a potential  alternative location for lesioning, more antero-superiorly. This may reduce  complications, without sacrificing efficacy, and individualise targeting.

Here, we administered peripheral  non-invasive focused ultrasound to hemiparkinsonian ('PD') and non-parkinsonian  (sham) rats to mimic vagus nerve stimulation and assessed its antidepressant-like  efficacy. Following 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion, akinesia-like immobility  was assessed in the limb-use asymmetry test, and despair- and anhedonic-like  behaviors were evaluated in the forced swim test and sucrose preference test,  respectively. After, tyrosine hydroxylase immuno-staining was employed to  visualize and quantify dopaminergic degeneration in the substantia nigra pars  compacta, ventral tegmental area, and striatum. We found that PD rats exhibited  akinesia-like immobility and > 90% reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase  immuno-staining ipsilateral to the lesioned side. PD rats also demonstrated  anhedonic-like behavior in the sucrose preference test compared to sham rats. No  6-OHDA lesion effect on immobility in the forced swim test limited conclusions  about the efficacy of ultrasound on despair-like behavior. However, ultrasound  improved anhedonic-like behavior in PD rats and this efficacy was sustained  through the end of the 1-week recovery period. The greatest number of animals  demonstrating increased sucrose preference was in the PD group receiving  ultrasound. Our findings here are the first to posit that peripheral non-invasive  focused ultrasound to the celiac plexus may improve anhedonia in PD with further  investigation needed to reveal its potential for clinical applicability.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","321-336","","2","242","","Exp Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

In 2018, the first magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound  system in Chinese mainland was installed at the First Medical Center of the PLA  General Hospital. This prospective, single center, open-label, single-arm study  was part of a worldwide prospective multicenter clinical trial  (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03253991) conducted to confirm the safety and  efficacy of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound for treating essential  tremor in the local population. From 2019 to 2020, 10 patients with medication  refractory essential tremor were recruited into this open-label, single arm  study. The treatment efficacy was determined using the Clinical Rating Scale for  Tremor. Safety was evaluated according to the incidence and severity of adverse  events. All of the subjects underwent a unilateral thalamotomy targeting the  ventral intermediate nucleus. At the baseline assessment, the estimated marginal  mean of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor total score was 58.3 ± 3.6, and this  improved after treatment to 23.1 ± 6.4 at a 12-month follow-up assessment. A  total of 50 adverse events were recorded, and 2 were defined as serious. The most  common intraoperative adverse events were nausea and headache. The most frequent  postoperative adverse events were paresthesia and equilibrium disorder. Most of  the adverse events were mild and usually disappeared within a few days.

In this study, a high intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU)-driven nanomotor is developed for effective therapy of TNBC  through induction of ferroptosis. Through bioinformatics analysis of typical  ferroptosis-associated genes in the FUSCCTNBC dataset, gambogic acid is  identified as a promising ferroptosis drug and loaded it into the nanomotor. It  is found that the rapid motion of nanomotors propelled by HIFU significantly  enhanced tumor accumulation and penetration. More importantly, HIFU not only  actuated nanomotors to trigger effective ferroptosis of TNBC cells, but also  drove nanomotors to activate ferroptosis-mediated antitumor immunity in primary  and metastatic TNBC models, resulting in effective tumor regression and  prevention of metastases. Overall, HIFU-driven nanomotors show great potential  for ferroptosis-immunotherapy of TNBC.","2024-02-11","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","e2305546","","","","","Adv Sci (Weinh)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024 The Authors.

METHODS: Real-world data from 101 patients who underwent MRgFUS  between July 2019 and March 2022 at a single institution were analyzed. Tremor  severity was assessed using the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Rating Scale for  Tremor (CRST). The patients were categorized into quartile groups based on their  mean SDR, and the characteristics, treatment effectiveness, treatment parameters,  and adverse events were evaluated among these subgroups. RESULTS: Patients were  classified into 4 quartiles based on the mean SDR: quartile 1 (Q1) (SDR  0.26-0.37), Q2 (SDR 0.38-0.42), Q3 (SDR 0.43-0.49), and Q4 (SDR 0.50-0.75).  MRgFUS significantly improved total CRST and tremor score across all SDR  subgroups. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the improvement  rates among the 4 subgroups. Analysis of the treatment parameters revealed that  lower mean SDR was associated with lower target maximum temperature and smaller  coagulation volume after focused ultrasound (FUS). Regarding adverse events,  headache and nausea during FUS and facial and head edema on the day after surgery  were more frequent in the Q1 subgroup (very low-SDR group). In contrast, numbness  was more common in the Q4 subgroup. However, all these adverse events had  resolved by the 3-month follow-up except numbness. CONCLUSIONS: This study  suggested that MRgFUS is effective and safe for patients with  medication-resistant essential tremor, including those with very low mean SDR.  However, the very low-SDR group had insufficient temperature elevation at the  target site compared with the high-SDR group, suggesting the need for a different  strategy. Notably, with careful adjustments and considerations, positive outcomes  can still be achieved in patients with very low SDR. Therefore, very low SDR  should not be considered an absolute exclusion criterion because it is expected  to increase the number of patients who benefit from MRgFUS.","2024-02-02","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","1-9","","","","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38306635","","","","essential tremor; functional neurosurgery; low skull density ratio; magnetic resonance–guided focused ultrasound; thalamotomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One important effect of histotripsy in  the brain is the blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening (BBBO) at the ablation site,  but there is a knowledge gap concerning the extent of histotripsy-induced BBBO.  Here we describe induction of BBBO by transcranial histotripsy and use of  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology to quantify changes in BBBO at the  periphery of the histotripsy ablation zone over time in the healthy mouse brain.  METHODS: An eight-element, 1 MHz histotripsy transducer with a focal distance of  32.5 mm was used to treat the brains of 23 healthy female BL6 mice. T1-gadolinium  (T1-Gd) MR images were acquired immediately following histotripsy treatment and  during each of the subsequent 4 wk to quantify the size and intensity of BBB  leakage. RESULTS: The T1-Gd MRI results revealed that the hyperintense BBBO  volume increased over the first week and subsided gradually over the following 3  wk. Histology revealed complete loss of tight junction proteins and blood vessels  in the center of the ablation region immediately after histotripsy, partial  recovery in the periphery of the ablation zone 1 wk following histotripsy and  near-complete recovery of tight junction complex after 4 wk. CONCLUSION: These  results provide the first evidence of transcranial histotripsy-induced BBBO and  repair at the periphery of the ablation zone.","2024-01-31","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","S0301-5629(23)00408-8","","","","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Transporters mediate the uptake or efflux of compounds  to and from the brain and they can also challenge the delivery of drugs for the  treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently there is a limited understanding  of changes in BBB transporters in AD. To investigate this, we generated brain  endothelial-like cells (iBECs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with  familial AD (FAD) Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutation and identified AD-specific  differences in transporter expression compared to control (ctrl) iBECs. We first  characterized the expression levels of 12 BBB transporters in AD-, Ctrl-, and  isogenic (PSEN1 corrected) iBECs to identify any AD specific differences. We then  exposed the cells to focused ultrasound (FUS) in the absence (FUS(only)) or  presence of microbubbles (MB) (FUS(+MB)), which is a novel therapeutic method  that can be used to transiently open the BBB to increase drug delivery into the  brain, however its effects on BBB transporter expression are largely unknown.  Following FUS(only) and FUS(+MB), we investigated whether the expression or  activity of key transporters could be modulated. Our findings demonstrate that  PSEN1 mutant FAD (PSEN1(AD)) possess phenotypical differences compared to control  iBECs in BBB transporter expression and function. Additionally, we show that  FUS(only) and FUS(+MB) can modulate BBB transporter expression and functional  activity in iBECs, having potential implications on drug penetration and amyloid  clearance. These findings highlight the differential responses of patient cells  to FUS treatment, with patient-derived models likely providing an important tool  for modelling therapeutic effects of FUS.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","e00299","","1","21","","Neurotherapeutics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

This study presents a  detailed dermoscopic analysis of skin healing post-High-Intensity Focused  Ultrasound (HIFU) treatment, focusing on common benign skin lesions, such as  seborrheic keratosis, sebaceous hyperplasia, vascular lesions, and sebaceous  nevi. Methods: Prior to HIFU treatment, a comprehensive assessment was conducted,  integrating ultrasound scanning and clinical evaluations. The TOOsonix System  ONE-M was employed for HIFU treatments, with parameters tailored to each lesion  type. Results: A common pattern observed across all lesions includes initial  whitening post treatment, followed by scab formation and the development of a  pink area with reparative vessels. This study, however, highlights distinct  differences in fibrosis patterns and healing timelines across different lesion  types. Each lesion type exhibited unique fibrosis patterns post treatment.  Flatter variants of seborrheic keratosis healed within a month, displaying  hypopigmentation and reparative vessels, alongside a distinct lattice fibrosis  pattern in more verrucous forms, which took about two months to heal. Sebaceous  hyperplasia, characterized by rapid healing within three weeks, demonstrated  fibrosis with pink areas and perpendicular white lines, concluding with a slight  depression. Vascular lesions varied in healing time based on depth, with  superficial ones showing whitening and crust formation, while deeper lesions had  vessel occlusion and size reduction accompanied by concentric fibrotic bands.  Sebaceous nevi presented the longest healing duration of three months,  characterized by amorphous white-gray structures, scab formation, and the  emergence of pink areas with branching vessels, leading to clear skin with  reduced white lines. Conclusions: in conclusion, this meticulous clinical  evaluation highlights the unique healing characteristics and timelines for each  skin lesion type treated with HIFU. These insights are invaluable for optimizing  follow-up assessments, identifying potential complications, and refining  treatment protocols. By providing detailed insights into the healing timelines  and patterns for different types of lesions, patients can be better informed  about their post-treatment journey.","2024-02-06","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","4","13","","J Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38398246  PMCID: PMC10888560","","","","HIFU; High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound; dermoscopy; sebaceous hyperplasia; sebaceous nevus; seborrheic keratosis; skin lesion healing; vascular lesion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Clinical and follow-up data of 308 patients with adenomyosis who were  treated with HIFU in Haifu Center, Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University of  Traditional Chinese Medicine from September 2017 to January 2022 were  retrospectively analyzed. The recurrence of adenomyosis and the efficacy of HIFU  at 6 months after surgery were followed up. To explore factors influencing  postoperative prognosis and recurrence, the following variables were analyzed:  patients' age, course of disease, gravidity and parity, size of the uterus,  duration of HIFU, duration of irradiation, treatment intensity, dysmenorrhea  score, time of follow-up, combined treatment of traditional Chinese medicine  (TCM), western medicine adjuvant treatment, lesion location and type, and  menorrhagia. RESULTS: Among the 308 patients, 238 (77%) were followed up from 6  to 36 months, with an average follow-up time of 15.24 ± 9.97 months. The other 70  (23%) were lost to follow-up. At 6-month after surgery, efficacy rates of  dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia management were 86.7% and 89.3%, respectively.  Postoperative recurrence rates were 4.8% (1-12 months), 9.0% (12-24 months), and  17.0% (24-36 months) for dysmenorrhea; and 6.3% (1-12 months), 2.4%  (12-24 months), and 12.2% (24-36 months) for menorrhagia. Multivariate logistic  regression analyses showed that parity (P = 0.043, OR = 1.773, 95% CI  1.018-3.087), uterine size (P = 0.019, OR = 1.004, 95% CI 1.001-1.007), combined  treatment of TCM (P = 0.047, OR = 1.846, 95% CI 1.008-3.381), diffuse lesion type  (P = 0.013, OR = 0.464, 95% CI 0.254-0.848) and ablation rate (P = 0.015,  OR = 0.481, 95%CI 0.267-0.868) were prognostic factors (P < 0.05). Age, course of  disease, gravidity, duration of HIFU, duration of irradiation, treatment  intensity, preoperative dysmenorrhea score, time of follow-up, western medicine  adjuvant therapy, lesion location, and preoperative menstrual volume had no  effect on prognosis (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: HIFU can effectively relieve  dysmenorrhea and reduce menstrual volume in patients with adenomyosis. Parity,  uterine size, lesion type (diffuse), and ablation rate are risk factors for  symptom recurrence after HIFU, while the combination of TCM therapy is a  protective factor for relapse. We, therefore, recommend TCM in the adjuvant  setting after HIFU according to patient condition.","2024-02-12","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","Arch Gynecol Obstet","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024.

A more accurate and sensitive approach is required. METHOD:  The echo amplitudes of the focused ultrasound (FUS) transducer in a testing mode  (short pulse duration and low power) were found to correlate with the ex vivo  coagulation. To further evaluate its coagulation prediction capabilities, in vivo  experiments were carried out. The liver, kidney, and leg muscles of three adult  goats were treated using clinical FUAS settings, and the echo amplitude of the  FUS transducer and grayscale in sonography before and after FUAS were collected.  On day 7, animals were sacrificed humanely, and the treated tissues were  dissected to expose the lesion. Echo amplitude changes and lesion areas were  analyzed statistically, as were the coagulation prediction metrics. RESULTS: The  echo amplitude changes of the FUS transducer correlate well with the lesion areas  in the liver (R = 0.682). Its prediction in accuracy (94.4% vs. 50%), sensitivity  (92.9% vs. 35.7%), and negative prediction (80% vs. 30.8%) is better than  sonography, but similar in specificity (80% vs. 100%) and positive prediction  (100% vs. 100%). In addition, the correlation between tissue depth and the lesion  area is not good (|R| < 0.2). Prediction performances in kidney and leg muscles  are similar.

However, the cellular and molecular  mechanisms of neurological repair and remodelling after LIFUS in ischaemic stroke  are unclear. METHODS: Ultrasound stimulation was treated in adult male mice 7  days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Angiogenesis was measured  by laser speckle imaging and histological analyses. Electromyography and fibre  photometry records were used for synaptogenesis. Brain atrophy volume and  neurobehaviour were assessed 0-14 days after ischaemia. iTRAQ proteomic analysis  was performed to explore the differentially expressed protein. scRNA-seq was used  for subcluster analysis of astrocytes. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation and  Western blot detected the expression of HMGB1 and CAMK2N1. RESULTS: Optimal  ultrasound stimulation increased cerebral blood flow, and improved  neurobehavioural outcomes in ischaemic mice (p<0.05). iTRAQ proteomic analysis  revealed that the expression of HMGB1 increased and CAMK2N1 decreased in the  ipsilateral hemisphere of the brain at 14 days after focal cerebral ischaemia  with ultrasound treatment (p<0.05). scRNA-seq revealed that this expression  pattern belonged to a subcluster of astrocytes after LIFUS in the ischaemic  brain. LIFUS upregulated HMGB1 expression, accompanied by VEGFA elevation  compared with the control group (p<0.05). Inhibition of HMGB1 expression in  astrocytes decreased microvessels counts and cerebral blood flow (p<0.05). LIFUS  reduced CAMK2N1 expression level, accompanied by increased extracellular calcium  ions and glutamatergic synapses (p<0.05). CAMK2N1 overexpression in astrocytes  decreased dendritic spines, and aggravated neurobehavioural outcomes (p<0.05).  CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that LIFUS promoted angiogenesis and  synaptogenesis after focal cerebral ischaemia by upregulating HMGB1 and  downregulating CAMK2N1 in a subcluster of astrocytes, suggesting that LIFUS  activated specific astrocyte subcluster could be a key target for ischaemic brain  therapy.","2024-01-08","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","svn-2023-002614","","","","","Stroke Vasc Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

We  leverage the high spatial resolution and deep focal lengths of low-intensity  focused ultrasound (LIFU) to noninvasively modulate the dACC for effects on  behavioral and cardiac autonomic responses using transient heat pain stimuli. A  N = 16 healthy human volunteers (6 M/10 F) received transient contact heat pain  during either LIFU to the dACC or Sham stimulation. Continuous  electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electrodermal response  (EDR) were recorded. Outcome measures included pain ratings, heart rate  variability, EDR response, blood pressure, and the amplitude of the contact  heat-evoked potential (CHEP).LIFU reduced pain ratings by 1.09 ± 0.20 points  relative to Sham. LIFU increased heart rate variability indexed by the standard  deviation of normal sinus beats (SDNN), low-frequency (LF) power, and the  low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio. There were no effects on the blood  pressure or EDR. LIFU resulted in a 38.1% reduction in the P2 CHEP amplitude.  Results demonstrate LIFU to the dACC reduces pain and alters autonomic responses  to acute heat pain stimuli. This has implications for the causal understanding of  human pain and autonomic processing in the dACC and potential future therapeutic  options for pain relief and modulation of homeostatic signals.","2024-02-21","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","8","44","","J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024 the authors.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38182418  PMCID: PMC10883612","","","","*Acute Pain; *Gyrus Cinguli/diagnostic imaging; Autonomic Nervous System; Heart; Heart Rate/physiology; Humans; Pain Perception; anterior cingulate; autonomic; contact heat; focused ultrasound; heart rate variability; pain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, there has been a trend towards an  increase in the incidence of NET especially insulinoma. AIM: Summarizing and  analyzing current data on various approaches to the treatment of insulinoma. Our  review includes a comprehensive assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of  currently available insulinoma treatment methods in comparison with past  experience, as well as a review of promising methods that are not currently  widely used. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of literature from such databases as  scientific electronic library elibrary.ru, Pubmed, Google Scholar, MedLine,  Scopus and Web of Science. RESULTS: The most common treatment for insulinoma is  surgery. For patients with high operative risk, alternative methods such as  alcohol ablation, radiofrequency ablation, and tumor embolization may be used.  Medications include the use of somatostatin analogues, diazoxide. The literature  describes the potential benefit of the use of beta-blockers, phenytoin, glucagon,  however, in clinical trials, these drugs have not demonstrated a significant  effect. For the treatment of malignant and metastatically advanced insulinoma,  targeted therapy (primarily Everolimus), chemotherapy, as well as embolization  (including chemoembolization, radioembolization), radiofrequency ablation (RFA),  microwave ablation and cryoablation, ultrasound ablation (HIFU), laser ablation,  brachytherapy, irreversible electroporation are used. CONCLUSION: The study of  new drugs is an important task for scientists, among medications the most  promising are new generations of somatostatin analogues, targeted drugs and  chemotherapy drugs. The rare frequency of insulinoma makes it difficult to  conduct randomized controlled trials and prospective studies. That is why  physicians and scientists need to maintain close contacts with each other and  take into account the experience of treating each patient with such disease,  which will help develop effective treatment algorithms in the future.","2024-02-28","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","46-55","","1","70","","Probl Endokrinol (Mosk)","","","","","","","","rus","","","","","","","Place: Russia (Federation) PMID: 38433541","","","","*Apudoma; *Insulinoma/surgery; *Neuroendocrine Tumors; *Pancreatic Neoplasms/therapy; Humans; Prospective Studies; Somatostatin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the  influence of BH on dendritic cell function is unknown, compromising our ability  to optimally combine BH with immunotherapies to control metastatic disease.  Methods: BH was applied using a sparse scan (1 mm spacing between sonications)  protocol to B16F10-ZsGreen melanoma in bilateral and unilateral settings.  Ipsilateral and contralateral tumor growth was measured. Flow cytometry was used  to track ZsGreen antigen and assess how BH drives dendritic cell behavior.  Results: BH monotherapy elicited ipsilateral and abscopal tumor control in this  highly aggressive model. Tumor antigen presence in immune cells in the  tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) was ~3-fold greater at 24h after BH, but this  abated by 96h. B cells, macrophages, monocytes, granulocytes, and both  conventional dendritic cell subsets (i.e. cDC1s and cDC2s) acquired markedly more  antigen with BH. BH drove activation of both cDC subsets, with activation being  dependent upon tumor antigen acquisition. Our data also suggest that BH-liberated  tumor antigen is complexed with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and  that cDCs do not traffic to the TDLN with antigen. Rather, they acquire antigen  as it flows through afferent lymph vessels into the TDLN. Conclusion: When  applied with a sparse scan protocol, BH monotherapy elicits abscopal melanoma  control and shapes dendritic cell function through several previously  unappreciated mechanisms. These results offer new insight into how to best  combine BH with immunotherapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.","2024","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","1647-1661","","4","14","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","eng","© The author(s).","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 38389838  PMCID: PMC10879863","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Melanoma/therapy; Antigens, Neoplasm; Dendritic Cells; Humans; boiling histotripsy; dendritic cells; focused ultrasound; immunotherapy; tumor antigen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a  noninvasive ablation technique. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness and  safety of MRgFUS and pTA for treating bone oligometastases and their  complications. METHODS: Studies were selected with a PICO/PRISMA protocol: pTA or  MRgFUS in patients with bone oligometastases; non-exclusive curative treatment.  Exclusion criteria were: primary bone tumor; concurrent radiation therapy;  palliative therapy; and absence of imaging at follow-up. PubMed, BioMed Central,  and Scopus were searched. The modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale assessed articles  quality. For each treatment (pTA and MRgFUS), we conducted two separate  random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the pooled effectiveness and safety. The  effectiveness was assessed by combining the proportions of treated lesions  achieving local tumor control (LTC); the safety by combining the complications  rates of treated patients. Meta-regression analyses were performed to identify  any outcome predictor. RESULTS: A total of 24 articles were included. Pooled LTC  rate for MRgFUS was 84% (N = 7, 95% CI 66-97%, I(2) = 74.7%) compared to 65% of  pTA (N = 17, 95% CI 51-78%, I(2) = 89.3%). Pooled complications rate was similar,  respectively, 13% (95% CI 1-32%, I(2) = 81.0%) for MRgFUS and 12% (95% CI 8-18%,  I(2) = 39.9%) for pTA, but major complications were recorded with pTA only. The  meta-regression analyses, including technique type, study design, tumor, and  follow-up, found no significant predictors. DISCUSSION: The effectiveness and  safety of the two techniques were found comparable, even though MRgFUS is a  noninvasive treatment that did not cause any major complication. Limited data  availability on MRgFUS and the lack of direct comparisons with pTA may affect  these findings. CONCLUSIONS: MRgFUS can be a valid, safe, and noninvasive  treatment for bone oligometastases. Direct comparison studies are needed to  confirm its promising benefits.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","291-306","","2","129","","Radiol Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024.

METHODS: Eighteen studies were selected from the seven databases. A  meta-analysis was applied to synthesize the reintervention rates for fibroids  across various follow-up durations. Subgroup-analysis was conducted based on the  year of surgery, sample size, guide methods, and non-perfusion volume ratio  (NPVR). Signal intensity of T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) was independently  evaluated for reintervention risk. RESULTS: The study enrolled 5216 patients with  fibroids treated with HIFU. There were 3247, 1239, 1762, and 2535 women reaching  reintervention rates of 1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1-1), 7% (95% CI:  4-11), 19% (95% CI: 11-27), and 29% (95% CI: 14-44) at 12, 24, 36, and 60-month  after HIFU. The reintervention rates of patients treated with US-guided HIFU  (USgHIFU) were significantly lower than those of patients treated with MR-guided  focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS). When the NPVR of fibroids was over 50%, the  reintervention rates at 12, 36 and 60-month after HIFU were 1% (95% CI: 0.3-2),  5% (95% CI: 3-8), and 15% (95% CI: 9-20).

In conventional HMI, the amplitude-modulated FUS sequence and imaging  pulse are transmitted simultaneously. With this method, the high-amplitude FUS  signal must be separated from the imaging data for tissue displacement  estimation. Frequency domain notch filtering and bandpass filtering were  previously used to filter FUS interference from imaging data. However, FUS  interference becomes more pronounced at the increased intensities and durations  necessary for thermal ablation, rendering frequency domain filtering challenging.  In this study, three methods for FUS interference filtering during HMI-guided FUS  ablation (HMIgFUS) were compared. The methods were notch filtering; interleaved  HMIgFUS, with interleaved FUS and imaging pulses; and FUS-net, a convolutional  neural network-based U-Net autoencoder developed by our group for FUS  interference filtering in radiofrequency data. FUS-net was applied here for the  first time for the purpose of ablation displacement monitoring. METHODS: The  three filtering methods were tested during 20 HMIgFUS acquisitions in an ex vivo  canine liver using a range of peak positive pressures from 11 to 18 MPa and  durations ranging from 60 to 180 seconds. The B-mode mean squared errors (MSEs)  and displacement amplitude contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the three methods  were calculated and compared. RESULTS: The interleaved method for HMIgFUS was  found to be significantly robust in avoiding FUS interference in all tested cases  for FUS ablation monitoring, especially cases with high FUS pressure and long  durations, as opposed to traditional notch filtering and FUS-net filtering. CNRs  obtained from displacement amplitude maps in the interleaved data set were  significantly higher in all cases than those obtained from the notch filtered and  FUS-net data sets. There was not a significant trend in displacement CNR between  the FUS-net and notch filtered data sets. However, B-mode MSE was found to be  significantly higher when comparing the FUS-net and interleaved data sets as  opposed to the notch filtered and interleaved data sets, suggesting further  potential of FUS-net as an FUS interference filtering method. CONCLUSION: These  findings indicate the robustness of interleaved HMIgFUS in avoiding FUS  interference during HMIgFUS monitoring and the advantages, limitations and future  potential of FUS-net and notch filtering.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","119-127","","1","50","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

METHODS: Fifty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were  randomly divided into acute control (n = 12, 22.22%), acute MI (AMI, n = 12,  22.22%), AMI + LIFU (n = 12, 22.22%), chronic control (n = 6, 11.11%), chronic MI  (CMI, n = 6, 11.11%), and CMI + LIFU (n = 6, 11.11%) groups. MI was induced by  left anterior artery ligation, and electrocardiographic recording for 0.5 hours  after MI and programmed electrophysiological stimulation were used to test the  vulnerability of VAs. Peripheral sympathetic neural activity was assessed by  measuring left stellate ganglion neural activity. Finally, hearts and brains were  extracted for Western blotting and histopathological analysis, respectively.  RESULTS: Compared with the AMI group, AMI-induced VAs (P < .05) and left stellate  ganglion neural activity (P < .05) were significantly attenuated in the AMI +  LIFU group. In addition, LIFU resulted in a significant reduction of microglial  activation in the PVN and expression of inflammatory cytokines in the  peri-ischemic myocardium. In the CMI + LIFU group, there was no obvious tissue  damage in the brain. CONCLUSION: LIFU modulation of the PVN may prevent the  incidence of post-MI VAs by attenuating MI-induced sympathetic neural activation  and inflammatory response.","2024-03","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","340-348","","3","21","","Heart Rhythm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Heart Rhythm Society.

However, the  influence of BH on dendritic cell function is unknown, compromising our ability  to optimally combine BH with immunotherapies to control metastatic disease.  METHODS: BH was applied using a sparse scan (1 mm spacing between sonications)  protocol to B16F10-ZsGreen melanoma in bilateral and unilateral settings.  Ipsilateral and contralateral tumor growth was measured. Flow cytometry was used  to track ZsGreen antigen and assess how BH drives dendritic cell behavior.  RESULTS: BH monotherapy elicited ipsilateral and abscopal tumor control in this  highly aggressive model. Tumor antigen presence in immune cells in the  tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) was ~3-fold greater at 24h after BH, but this  abated by 96h. B cells, macrophages, monocytes, granulocytes, and both  conventional dendritic cell subsets (i.e. cDC1s and cDC2s) acquired markedly more  antigen with BH. BH drove activation of both cDC subsets, with activation being  dependent upon tumor antigen acquisition. Our data also suggest that BH-liberated  tumor antigen is complexed with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and  that cDCs do not traffic to the TDLN with antigen. Rather, they acquire antigen  as it flows through afferent lymph vessels into the TDLN. CONCLUSION: When  applied with a sparse scan protocol, BH monotherapy elicits abscopal melanoma  control and shapes dendritic cell function through several previously  unappreciated mechanisms. These results offer new insight into how to best  combine BH with immunotherapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.","2024-01-05","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: bioRxiv Pages: 2023.09.02.552844 Publication Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology PMID: 37732205  PMCID: PMC10508728","","","","Focused ultrasound; boiling histotripsy; dendritic cells; immunotherapy; tumor antigen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As of this article's publication, the only US Food and  Drug Administration (FDA)-approved uses of FUS for movement disorders are  thalamotomy for essential tremor (ET) and tremor-dominant Parkinson's Disease  (PD), and pallidotomy for other cardinal symptoms of PD. We present a  state-of-the-art review on all non-FDA approved indications of FUS for movement  disorders, beyond the most well-described indications of ET and PD. Our objective  was to summarize the safety and efficacy of FUS in this setting and provide a  roadmap for future directions of FUS for movement disorders. METHODS: A  state-of-the-art review was conducted on use of FUS for non-FDA approved movement  disorders. All movement disorders excluding FDA-approved uses for ET and PD were  included. RESULTS: A total of 25 studies on 172 patients were included. In  patients with tremor plus dystonia syndromes (n = 6), ventralis intermediate  nucleus of the thalamus (VIM)-FUS gave &gt;50% tremor reduction, with no  improvement in dystonia and worsened dystonia in 2/6 patients. Ventral-oralis  complex (VO)-FUS gave &gt;50% improvement for focal hand dystonia (n = 6) and  100% return to musical performance in musician's dystonia (n = 6). In patients  with multiple sclerosis (MS) and tremor (n = 3), improvement in tremor was seen  in 2 patients with a favorable skull density ratio; no MS disease change was  noted after VIM-FUS. In patients with tremor and comorbid ataxia syndromes (n =  3), none were found to have worsened ataxia after VIM-FUS; all had clinically  significant tremor improvement. Subthalamic nucleus (STN)-FUS for PD (n = 49)  gave approximately 50% improvement in PD motor symptoms, with dystonia and mild  dyskinesias as possible adverse effects. Cerebellothalamic tract (CTT-FUS) for ET  (n = 42) gave 55-90% tremor improvement, with gait dysfunction as a rare  persistent adverse effect. Pallidothalamic tract (PTT-FUS) for PD (n = 50) gave  approximately 50% improvement in motor symptoms, with mild speech dysfunction as  a possible adverse effect. CONCLUSION: VIM-FUS appeared safe and effective for  heterogenous tremor etiologies, and VO-FUS appeared most effective for isolated  segmental dystonia. STN-FUS was effective for PD symptom reduction; postoperative  dystonia and mild on-medication dyskinesias required medical management.  Tractography-based targeting with CTT-FUS for ET and PTT-FUS for PD demonstrated  promising early results. Larger prospective trials with long-term follow-up are  needed to the evaluate the safety and efficacy non-FDA approved indications for  FUS.","2024-02-16","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","1-16","","","","","Stereotact Funct Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","© 2024 S.

Linking cavitation and anatomy was found to be important for predictable outcomes in focused-ultrasound blood-brain-barrier-opening and  requires high resolution cavitation mapping. However, cavitation mapping  techniques for planning and monitoring of therapeutic procedures either (1) do  not leverage the full resolution capabilities of ultrasound imaging or (2)  place constraints on the length of the therapeutic pulse. This study aimed to  develop a high-resolution technique that could resolve vascular anatomy in the  cavitation map.Approach. Herein, we develop  BandPass-sampled-equivalent-time-active-cavitation-imaging (BP-ETACI), derived  from bandpass sampling and dual-frequency contrast imaging at 12.5 MHz to produce  cavitation maps prior and during blood-brain barrier opening with long  therapeutic bursts using a 1.5 MHz focused transducer in the brain of C57BL/6  mice.Main results. The BP-ETACI cavitation maps were found to correlate with the  vascular anatomy in ultrasound localization microscopy vascular maps and in  histological sections. Cavitation maps produced from non-blood-brain-barrier  disrupting doses showed the same cavitation-bearing vasculature as maps produced  over entire blood-brain-barrier opening procedures, allowing use for (1)  monitoring focused-ultrasound blood-brain-barrier-opening (FUS-BBBO), but also  for (2) therapy planning and target verification.Significance. BP-ETACI is  versatile, created high resolution cavitation maps in the mouse brain and is  easily translatable to existing FUS-BBBO experiments.

CCMs can cause debilitating neurological symptoms, and surgical  excision or stereotactic radiosurgery are the only current treatment options.  Meanwhile, transient blood-brain barrier opening (BBBO) with focused ultrasound  (FUS) and microbubbles is now understood to exert potentially beneficial  bioeffects, such as stimulation of neurogenesis and clearance of amyloid-β. Here,  we tested whether FUS BBBO could be deployed therapeutically to control CCM  formation and progression in a clinically-representative murine model. METHODS:  CCMs were induced in mice by postnatal, endothelial-specific Krit1 ablation. FUS  was applied for BBBO with fixed peak-negative pressures (PNPs; 0.2-0.6 MPa) or  passive cavitation detection-modulated PNPs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was  used to target FUS treatments, evaluate safety, and measure longitudinal changes  in CCM growth after BBBO. RESULTS: FUS BBBO elicited gadolinium accumulation  primarily at the perilesional boundaries of CCMs, rather than lesion cores.  Passive cavitation detection and gadolinium contrast enhancement were comparable  in CCM and wild-type mice, indicating that Krit1 ablation does not confer  differential sensitivity to FUS BBBO. Acutely, CCMs exposed to FUS BBBO remained  structurally stable, with no signs of hemorrhage. Longitudinal MRI revealed that  FUS BBBO halted the growth of 94% of CCMs treated in the study. At 1 month, FUS  BBBO-treated lesions lost, on average, 9% of their pre-sonication volume. In  contrast, non-sonicated control lesions grew to 670% of their initial volume.  Lesion control with FUS BBBO was accompanied by a marked reduction in the area  and mesenchymal appearance of Krit mutant endothelium. Strikingly, in mice  receiving multiple BBBO treatments with fixed PNPs, de novo CCM formation was  significantly reduced by 81%. Mock treatment plans on MRIs of patients with  surgically inaccessible lesions revealed their lesions are amenable to FUS BBBO  with current clinical technology. CONCLUSIONS: Our results establish FUS BBBO as  a novel, non-invasive modality that can safely arrest murine CCM growth and  prevent their de novo formation. As an incisionless, MR image-guided therapy with  the ability to target eloquent brain locations, FUS BBBO offers an unparalleled  potential to revolutionize the therapeutic experience and enhance the  accessibility of treatments for CCM patients.","2024-02-04","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: bioRxiv Pages: 2024.01.31.577810 Publication Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology PMID: 38352349  PMCID: PMC10862920","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultrasonic irradiation has been explored  for its ability to enhance dissolution rates and modify surface characteristics.  In this study, we investigate the dissolution of magnesium (Mg) and magnesium  alloys under high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) conditions with frequency  sweeping (wobbling). Our findings reveal distinct effects of cavitation and  acoustic streaming on the dissolution process. For pure magnesium, ultrasonic  treatment significantly increases dissolution rates compared to silent  conditions. Negative frequency sweeps result in the highest dissolution rates,  linked to increased cavitation activity, while positive sweeps reduce dissolution  rates but maintain acoustic streaming effects. The removal of surface oxides is  accelerated in all sonication conditions. Macro- and micro-roughness patterns on  the surface correspond to the wobbling frequency range, with wavelengths matching  the average ultrasonic frequency. However, dissolution is not uniform across the  sample, and preferential attack occurs at the focal point during negative  frequency sweeps. In contrast, magnesium alloys exhibit lower dissolution rates  than pure Mg. The alloy's mechanical properties make it less susceptible to  cavitation erosion but more sensitive to acoustic streaming-induced dissolution.  Grain boundaries are preferentially attacked, revealing differences between  ductile pure Mg and the harder, more cavitation-resistant, alloy. This study  highlights the complex interplay between cavitation and acoustic streaming in the  dissolution of magnesium and its alloys under HIFU conditions, shedding light on  the limits and potential applications of this technique, particularly in  microstructure analysis.","2024-02-28","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","106836","","","104","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2024.

This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of  combining high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) with suction curettage for  treating CSP. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in four databases,  namely PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library, to identify published  studies evaluating the use of HIFU combined with suction curettage to treat CSP.  Intraoperative blood loss, treatment success rate, and reproductive results were  the primary outcomes assessed. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies involving 1251  patients with CSP, all of whom received preoperative HIFU therapy were included.  The average hospital stay was 6.22 days, the intraoperative blood loss was  26.29 ml and the incidence of adverse events was 15.60%, including abdominal or  lower limb pain, fever, vaginal bleeding, haematuria and vomiting. Furthermore,  post-treatment follow-up showed that serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin levels  were rapidly normalized (average of 25.48 days) and menstruation returned  (average of 33.03 days). The treatment had a remarkable success rate of 97.60%  and a subsequent pregnancy rate of 68.70%. CONCLUSION: While the combination of  HIFU and suction-curettage may induce common adverse effects such as lower  abdominal or limb pain, these reactions typically do not necessitate therapeutic  intervention. Additionally, the size of the gestational sac is a determinant of  the procedure's success. In conclusion, HIFU combined with suction curettage  demonstrates promising clinical efficacy, safety and favourable reproductive  outcomes in managing CSP.","2024","2024-03-06 16:58:48","2024-03-06T16:58:48Z","","2310019","","1","41","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38329796","","","","*Blood Loss, Surgical; *Vacuum Curettage; Caesarean scar pregnancy; Cesarean Section/adverse effects; Cicatrix/surgery; Female; Humans; Pain; Pregnancy; clinical efficacy; favourable reproductive outcomes; high-intensity focused ultrasound; safety; suction curettage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
