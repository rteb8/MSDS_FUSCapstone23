This meta-analysis aimed to focus on the pregnancy rate and  outcomes in female patients following UAE and to conduct subgroup analyses based  on different patient populations or various control treatments. METHODS: A  systematic literature search was conducted on 2 August 2023 through the Web of  Science, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library of Clinical Trials for all  potential studies. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were  applied to compare pregnancy rates and outcomes between the UAE group and the  control group. Heterogeneity was evaluated statistically by using the  chi-square-based Cochran's Q test and Higgins I(2) statistics, and 95% prediction  interval (PI). Software R 4.3.1 and Stata 12.0 were used for meta-analysis. The  trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed with TSA v0.9.5.10 Beta software.  RESULTS: A total of 15 eligible studies (11 cohort studies, 3 randomized  controlled trials, and 1 non-randomized clinical trial) were included in this  meta-analysis. The overall results revealed that UAE significantly decreased  postoperative pregnancy rate [RR (95% CI): 0.721 (0.531-0.979), 95% PI:  0.248-2.097] and was associated with an increased risk of postoperative PPH [RR  (95% CI): 3.182 (1.319-7.675), 95% PI: 0.474-22.089]. Analysis grouped by  population indicated that UAE decreased the risk of preterm delivery [RR (95%  CI): 0.326 (0.128-0.831), p = 0.019] and cesarean section [RR (95% CI): 0.693  (0.481-0.999), p = 0.050] and increased the risk of placenta previa [RR (95% CI):  8.739 (1.580-48.341), p = 0.013] in patients with UFs, CSP, and PPH,  respectively. When compared with myomectomy, HIFU, and non-use of UAE, UAE  treatment was associated with the reduced risks of preterm delivery [RR (95% CI):  0.296 (0.106-0.826)] and cesarean section [(95% CI): 0.693 (0.481-0.999),  p = 0.050] and increased placenta previa risk [RR (95% CI): 10.682  (6.859-16.636)], respectively. CONCLUSION: UAE treatment was associated with a  lower postoperative pregnancy rate and increased risk of PPH. Subgroup analysis  suggested that UAE was shown to decrease the risk of preterm delivery and  cesarean section and increase placenta previa risk.Systematic review  registration:https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, Identifier CRD42023448257.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1283279","","","10","","Front Med (Lausanne)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Yan, Zhou, He and Liu.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38179282  PMCID: PMC10764427","","","","cesarean scar pregnancy; postpartum hemorrhage; pregnancy outcomes; uterine artery embolization; uterine fibroids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last two decades, the use of PoCUS in the emergency room has  dramatically increased. This study aimed to determine emergency physicians'  retention of knowledge and skills after a brief training workshop on a focused  ultrasound-guided approach to a patient presenting with undifferentiated shock,  shortness of breath, and cardiac arrest in the emergency department of a tertiary  care hospital. The secondary aim was to deliver the PoCUS-guided algorithmic  approach to manage a patient presenting with undifferentiated shock, respiratory  distress, and cardiac arrest in the emergency department. METHODS: A  quasi-experimental study was conducted with a single-day Point of Care  Ultrasonographic Life Support in Emergency (PULSE) training workshop in October  2021 at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 32  participants attended the course, including twenty-one junior residents (PGY 1  and 2) and medical officers with experience of fewer than two years working in  different emergency departments of urban tertiary care hospitals across Karachi,  Pakistan. Pre- and post-assessment tools comprised a written examination,  evaluating participants' knowledge and skills in ultrasound image acquisition and  interpretation. Cronbach's alpha was used to calculate the validity of the tool.  Results obtained before and after the training session were compared by the  McNemar's test. A p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: There  was a significant improvement in response to each question pre to post-test after  completion of the course (Table 1). The significant change can be seen in  questions 7, 8, 13, and 15, with a percentage change of 33.3, 80.9, 42.9, and  47.7. There was a significant improvement in the understanding and knowledge of  participants after the training. The scores in the post-test were high compared  to the pre-test in each category, i.e., respiratory distress (p < 0.017), cardiac  arrest (p < 0.041), basic ultrasound knowledge (p < 0.001), and undifferentiated  shock (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: All participants showed improvement in their  knowledge and confidence regarding using PoCUS in life-threatening conditions.  Through this study, we have also developed an algorithmic approach to managing  undifferentiated shock, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. Future studies  must assess the effectiveness and feasibility of incorporating these algorithms  into clinical practice.","2023-08-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","49","","1","16","","Int J Emerg Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

A systematic review was conducted throughout  September 2022 using the PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Embase databases.  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA)  guidelines were followed to identify eligible studies. A total of 55 studies  (3836 patients) met our eligibility criteria. The vast majority of men included  had radiation therapy (including brachytherapy) as their first-line treatment (n  = 3240, 84%). Other first-line treatments included HIFU (n = 338, 9%),  electroporation (n = 59, 2%), proton beam therapy (n = 54, 1.5%), cryotherapy (n  = 34, 1%), focal vascular targeted photodynamic therapy (n = 22, 0.6%), and  transurethral ultrasound ablation (n = 19, 0.5%). Median preoperative PSA, at the  time of recurrence, ranged from 1.5 to 14.4 ng/mL. The surgical approach was open  in 2300 (60%) cases, robotic in 1465 (38%) cases, and laparoscopic in 71 (2%)  cases. Since 2019, there has been a clear increase in robotic versus conventional  surgery (1245 versus 525 cases, respectively). The median operative time and  blood loss ranged from 80 to 297 min and 75 to 914 mL, respectively. Concomitant  lymph node dissection was performed in 2587 cases (79%). The overall complication  rate was 34%, with a majority of Clavien grade I or II complications. Clavien ≥ 3  complications ranged from 0 to 64%. Positive surgical margins were noted in 792  cases (32%). The median follow-up ranged from 4.6 to 94 months. Biochemical  recurrence after sRP ranged from 8% to 51.5% at 12 months, from 0% to 66% at 22  months, and from 48% to 59% at 60 months. The specific and overall survival rates  ranged from 13.4 to 98% and 62 to 100% at 5 years, respectively. Urinary  continence was maintained in 52.1% of cases. sRP demonstrated acceptable  oncological outcomes. These results, after sRP, are influenced by several  factors, and above all by pre-treatment assessment, including imaging, with the  development of mpMRI and metabolic imaging. Our results demonstrated that SRP can  be considered a suitable treatment option for selected patients, but the level of  evidence remains low.","2023-11-20","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","22","15","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38001745  PMCID: PMC10670522","","","","prostate cancer; recurrence; salvage radical prostatectomy; systematic review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, few studies have analyzed whether it is feasible for intensive  care nurses to perform POCUS on critically ill patients. This study aimed to  evaluate whether the findings of briefly trained intensive care nurses'  ultrasound examinations agreed with conventional examinations performed by  physicians. METHODS AND RESULTS: This comparative cross-sectional inter-rater  agreement study comprised 50 patients admitted to a cardiac intensive care unit  (CICU), with signs and symptoms of acute dyspnoea and suspected cardiac disease.  After a brief training session, the study nurses performed standardized  examinations of each patient's inferior vena cava (IVC) and the pleural and  pericardial cavities using a handheld ultrasound device. A blinded physician  repeated the same examinations using conventional ultrasound. Analysis using  Gwet's agreement coefficient with quadratic weights showed moderate agreement for  the IVC respiration variation [0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38-0.82],  and substantial agreement for the IVC diameter (0.70; 95% CI: 0.50-0.90) and  right-sided pleural effusion (0.70; 95% CI: 0.52-0.88). For left-sided pleural  effusion (0.85; 95% CI: 0.75-0.95) and pericardial effusion (0.95; 95% CI:  0.90-1.01), the agreement was almost perfect. CONCLUSIONS: Briefly trained  intensive care nurses in a CICU can perform POCUS examinations of the IVC and  pleural and pericardial cavities with moderate to almost perfect agreement with  identical examinations performed by physicians.","2023-07-19","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","482-488","","5","22","","Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2022.

DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and  Embase for literature from January 2000 to January 2022. METHODS OF STUDY  SELECTION: We included all studies reporting reproductive outcomes of  uterine-sparing surgery for patients with AD with fertility requirements.  Surgical treatment was classified as complete excision or incomplete removal of  AD and nonexcisional techniques for induction of necrosis in AD. The latter  included physically removing the tissue where pathology is present or disrupting  the blood flow to the affected area, involving high-intensity focused ultrasound,  microwave ablation, radiofrequency ablation, and uterine artery embolization. Two  independent researchers performed study selection according to the screening  criteria. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: A total of 13 studies with 1319  patients with AD were included in this study, comprising 795 women wishing  fertility. Pooled estimates of pregnancy, miscarriage, and live-birth rates after  excisional treatment for women attempting to conceive were 40% (95% confidence  interval [CI], 29-52), 21% (95% CI, 16-27), and 70% (95% CI, 64-76),  respectively, and corresponding rates after nonexcisional treatment were 51% (95%  CI, 42-60), 22% (95% CI, 13-34), and 71% (95% CI, 57-83), respectively. The  differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Excisional treatment  could be a treatment consideration for patients with symptomatic AD and  infertility for several years or repeated failure of assisted reproductive  technology. Nonexcisional techniques may be considered probably for AD-related  infertility.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","543-554","","7","30","","J Minim Invasive Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 AAGL.

We propose a novel scoring system, the Prostate  Imaging after Focal Ablation (PI-FAB) score, to fill this gap. PI-FAB involves a  3-point scale for rating MRI sequences in sequential order: (1) dynamic  contrast-enhanced sequences; (2) diffusion-weighted imaging, split into  assessment of the high-b-value sequence first and then the apparent diffusion  coefficient map; and (3) T2-weighted imaging. It is essential that the  pretreatment scan is also available to help with this assessment. We designed  PI-FAB using our experience of reading postablation scans over the past 15 years  and include details for four representative patients initially treated with  high-intensity focus ultrasound at our institution to demonstrate the scoring  system. We propose PI-FAB as a standardised method for evaluating prostate MRI  scans after treatment with focal ablation. The next step is to evaluate its  performance across multiple experienced readers of MRI after focal therapy in a  clinical data set. PATIENT SUMMARY: We propose a scoring system called PI-FAB for  assessing the appearance of magnetic resonance imaging scans of the prostate  after focal treatment for localised prostate cancer. This will help clinicians in  deciding on further follow-up.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","629-634","","6","6","","Eur Urol Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

NIBS are hypothesized to rebalance pathological brain  networks thus reducing symptoms and improving functioning. This development has  been fueled by controlled studies with increasing size and rigor aiming to  characterize how treatments induce clinically effective change. Clinical trials  of NIBS for specific indications have resulted in federal approval for unipolar  depression, bipolar depression, smoking cessation, and obsessive-compulsive  disorder in the United States, and several other indications worldwide. As a  rapidly emerging field, there are numerous pre-clinical indications currently in  development using a variety of electrical and magnetic, non-convulsive, and  convulsive approaches. This review discusses the state-of-the-science surrounding  promising avenues of NIBS currently in pre-approval stages for non-affective  psychiatric disorders. We consider emerging therapies for psychosis, anxiety  disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and borderline personality disorder,  utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current  stimulation (tDCS), and magnetic seizure therapy (MST), with an additional brief  section for early-stage techniques including transcranial focused ultrasound  stimulation (tFUS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). As  revealed in this review, there is considerable promise across all four  psychiatric indications with different NIBS approaches. Positive findings are  notable for the treatment of psychosis using tDCS, MST, and rTMS. While rTMS is  already FDA approved for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder,  methodologies such as tDCS also demonstrate potential in this condition. Emerging  techniques show promise for treating non-affective disorders likely leading to  future regulatory approvals.","2023-12-14","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","390","","1","13","","Transl Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Levodopa is the most efficacious drug for most  patients and should be used as primary approach to control troublesome tremor.  While the efficacy of oral dopamine agonists on PD tremor has been demonstrated  in controlled trials, there is no evidence of greater antitremor efficacy  compared to levodopa. The magnitude of the antitremor effect of anticholinergics  is generally lower than that of levodopa. Due to their adverse effects,  anticholinergics have a limited role in selected young and cognitively intact  patients. Propranolol may improve resting and action tremor and may be considered  as an adjunct in patients with insufficient tremor response to levodopa and this  also applies to clozapine, despite its unfavorable adverse effect profile.  Treating motor fluctuations with MAO-B and COMT inhibitors, dopamine agonists,  amantadine, or on-demand treatments such as subcutaneous or sublingual  apomorphine and inhaled levodopa as well as with continuous infusions of levodopa  or apomorphine will improve off period tremor episodes. For patients with  drug-refractory PD tremor despite levodopa optimization deep brain stimulation  and focused ultrasound are first-line considerations. Surgery can also be highly  effective for the treatment medication-refractory tremor in selected patients  without motor fluctuations. The present review highlights the clinical essentials  of parkinsonian tremor, critically examines available trial data on the effects  of medication and surgical approaches and provides guidance for the choice of  treatments to control PD tremor in clinical practice.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","127-144","","2","13","","J Parkinsons Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 36847017  PMCID: PMC10041452","","","","*Parkinson Disease/complications/drug therapy; Antiparkinson Agents; Apomorphine; Cholinergic Antagonists/therapeutic use; Dopamine Agonists/therapeutic use; Humans; Levodopa/therapeutic use; Parkinson’s disease; Tremor/drug therapy/etiology; levodopa; levodopa-resistance; treatment; tremor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this task, real-time 3D temperature  visualization is key to target the diseased tissues while minimizing damage to  the surroundings. Current computed tomography (CT) thermometry is based on  energy-integrated CT, tissue-specific experimental data, and linear relationships  between attenuation and temperature. In this paper, we develop a novel approach  using photon-counting CT for material decomposition and a neural network to  predict temperature based on thermal characteristics of base materials and  spectral tomographic measurements of a volume of interest. In our feasibility  study, distilled water, 50 mmol/L CaCl(2), and 600 mmol/L CaCl(2) are chosen as  the base materials. Their attenuations are measured in four discrete energy bins  at various temperatures. The neural network trained on the experimental data  achieves a mean absolute error of 3.97 °C and 1.80 °C on 300 mmol/L CaCl(2) and a  milk-based protein shake respectively. These experimental results indicate that  our approach is promising for handling non-linear thermal properties for  materials that are similar or dissimilar to our base materials.","2023-01-14","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2","","1","6","","Vis Comput Ind Biomed Art","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

In preparation for our first  in-human TUS studies, we targeted TUS to the lateral geniculate nucleus (visual  thalamus) in a large mammal (sheep). Full-field light flash stimuli were  presented with or without concomitant TUS in randomly interleaved trials. Similar  to what has previously observed by Fry et al (Nature 1959) in cats, EEG  visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) were reversibly suppressed by TUS to the LGN. No  changes in VEPs were observed in sheep who received sham-TUS to a control site in  the basal ganglia, ruling out potential transducer auditory-somatosensory  confounds. Magnetic resonance acoustic radiation force imaging (MR-ARFI), a  technique to measure the ultrasound focus in situ, showed a focal volume of  microscopic displacement at the expected target. Excitingly, MR-ARFI predicted  the suppressive effect on VEPs in individual subjects, suggesting that MR-ARFI  can be used to confirm TUS targeting and estimate neurophysiological impact. We  are now translating this paradigm into human, targeting TUS to the LGN while  participants perform a contrast detection task with EEG recording of steady-state  VEPs. MR-ARFI will be measured to evaluate targeting and estimate TUS dosage in  each participant. This work provides the foundation for a dissection of the roles  of different subcortical nuclei in different aspects of human vision.","2023-12-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","23","","15","23","","J Vis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38109625","","","","*Brain/physiology; *Visual Pathways/diagnostic imaging; Animals; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Sheep; Ultrasonography/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the aim  of developing such a method, this study investigated the use of piezoelectric  molybdenum disulfide nanosheets (MoS(2) NS) to remotely convert ultrasound energy  into localized electrical stimulation in vitro and in vivo. The application of  ultrasound to cells surrounding MoS(2) NS required only a single pulse of 2 MHz  ultrasound (400 kPa, 1,000,000 cycles, and 500 ms pulse duration) to elicit  significant responses in 37.9 ± 7.4% of cells in terms of fluxes of calcium ions  without detectable cellular damage. The proportion of responsive cells was mainly  influenced by the acoustic pressure, number of ultrasound cycles, and  concentration of MoS(2) NS. Tests using appropriate blockers revealed that  voltage-gated membrane channels were activated. In vivo data suggested that, with  ultrasound stimulation, neurons closest to the MoS(2) NS were 3-fold more likely  to present c-Fos expression than cells far from the NS. The successful activation  of neurons surrounding MoS(2) NS suggests that this represents a method with high  spatial precision for selectively modulating one or several targeted brain  circuits.","2023-05-23","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","9140-9154","","10","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37163347","","","","*Nanostructures; 2D nanomaterials; Neurons; molybdenum disulfide; nanosheets; neuromodulation; piezoelectric effect; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most  traditional focusing techniques focus on the design and improvement of  single-point focusing, neglecting the need to carry more dimensions of multifocal  beams. Here we propose an automatic multifocal beamforming method, which is  implemented using a four-step phase metasurface. The metasurface composed of  four-step phases improves the transmission efficiency of acoustic waves as a  matching layer and enhances the focusing efficiency at the target focal position.  The change in the number of focused beams does not affect the full width at half  maximum (FWHM), revealing the flexibility of the arbitrary multifocal beamforming  method. Phase-optimized hybrid lenses reduce the sidelobe amplitude, and  excellent agreement is observed between the simulation and experiments for  triple-focusing beamforming metasurface lenses. The particle trapping experiment  further validates the profile of the triple-focusing beam. The proposed hybrid  lens can achieve flexible focusing in three dimensions (3D) and arbitrary  multipoint, which may have potential prospects for biomedical imaging, acoustic  tweezers, and brain neural modulation.","2023-05-31","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","6","14","","Micromachines (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37374762  PMCID: PMC10305295","","","","Fresnel lens; acoustic metasurface; acoustic tweezers; multi-step phase; multifocal beamforming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rapid development of nano-scale-based technologies makes imperative  the need for novel acoustic devices that take advantage of nanomaterials as well  as their extraordinary physical properties. The successful design of such  acoustic components requires the implementation of efficient nanostructures  accompanied by fast and accurate modeling. Here, endohedral fullerene and carbon  nano-onion one-dimensional nano-chains are explored as possible candidate  nanodevices that generate unique frequency band gaps.

Between 30 % and 60 % of GBM are characterized by overexpression of  the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). The anti-EGFR antibody Cetuximab  (CTX) showed a favorable effect for EGFR(+) colorectal cancer but failed to  demonstrate efficacy for GBM. Insufficient CTX passage through the blood-brain  barrier (BBB) and the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) is assumed to be the primary  determinant of the limited efficacy of this immunotherapy. OBJECTIVE: Using  positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we have previously demonstrated that  focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles (µB) allowed significant and  persistent delivery of CTX across the BBB in healthy mice. In the current study,  we investigated by PET imaging the combination impact of CTX and FUS on  orthotopic GBM preclinical model. METHODS: After radiolabeling CTX with the long  half-life isotope (89)Zr, PET images have been acquired overtime in mice bearing  U251 (EGFR(+)) with or without FUS treatment. Autoradiography combined with  immunofluorescence staining was used to corroborate CTX delivery with EGFR  expression. A survival study was conducted simultaneously to evaluate the  therapeutic benefit of repeated CTX monotherapy associated or not with FUS.  RESULTS: Ex vivo analysis confirmed that FUS enhanced and homogenized the  delivery of CTX into all the FUS exposure area, including the tumor and the  contralateral hemisphere at the early-time-point. Interestingly, FUS did not  improve the long-term accumulation and retention of CTX in the tumor compared  with the control group (no FUS). No significant difference in the CTX treatment  efficacy, determined by the survival between FUS and non-FUS groups, has been  either observed. This result is consistent with the absence of change in the CTX  distribution through the GBM tumor after FUS. The neuroinflammation induced by  FUS is not significant enough to explain the failure of the CTX delivery  improvement. CONCLUSION: All together, these data suggest that the role of FUS  combined with µB on the CTX distribution, even after multiple therapeutic  sessions and glial cell activation is insufficient to improve survival of GBM  mice compared with CTX treatment alone in this model.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","141-151","","","182","","Eur J Pharm Biopharm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In our previous work with a neuronavigation-guided FUS system, only part  of the cavitation signal could be monitored in real time due to the computational  burden although full-burst analysis is required to detect transient and  stochastic cavitation activity. In addition, the spatial resolution of PAM can be  limited for a small-aperture receiving array transducer. For full-burst real-time  PAM with enhanced resolution, we developed a parallel processing scheme for  coherence-factor-based PAM (CF-PAM) and implemented it onto the  neuronavigation-guided FUS system using a co-axial phased-array imaging  transducer. METHODS: Simulation and in-vitro human skull studies were conducted  for the performance evaluation of the proposed method in terms of spatial  resolution and processing speed. We also carried out real-time cavitation mapping  during BBB opening in non-human primates (NHPs). RESULTS: CF-PAM with the  proposed processing scheme provided better resolution than that of traditional  time-exposure-acoustics PAM with a higher processing speed than that of  eigenspace-based robust Capon beamformer, which facilitated the full-burst PAM  with the integration time of 10 ms at a rate of 2 Hz. In vivo feasibility of PAM  with the co-axial imaging transducer was also demonstrated in two NHPs, showing  the advantages of using real-time B-mode and full-burst PAM for accurate  targeting and safe treatment monitoring.

Image-guided navigation has  been widely utilized to visualize the location of acoustic focus in the cranial  cavity. However, this system is often inaccurate because of the significant  aberrations caused by the skull. Therefore, acoustic simulations using a  numerical solver have been widely adopted to compensate for this inaccuracy.  Although the simulation can predict the intracranial acoustic pressure field,  real-time application during tFUS treatment is almost impossible due to the high  computational cost. In this study, we propose a neural network-based real-time  acoustic simulation framework and test its feasibility by implementing a  simulation-guided navigation (SGN) system. Real-time acoustic simulation is  performed using a 3D conditional generative adversarial network (3D-cGAN) model  featuring residual blocks and multiple loss functions. This network was trained  by the conventional numerical acoustic simulation program (i.e., k-Wave). The SGN  system is then implemented by integrating real-time acoustic simulation with a  conventional image-guided navigation system. The proposed system can provide  simulation results with a frame rate of 5 Hz (i.e., about 0.2 s), including all  processing times. In numerical validation (3D-cGAN vs. k-Wave), the average peak  intracranial pressure error was 6.8 ± 5.5%, and the average acoustic focus  position error was 5.3 ± 7.7 mm. In experimental validation using a skull phantom  (3D-cGAN vs. actual measurement), the average peak intracranial pressure error  was 4.5%, and the average acoustic focus position error was 6.6 mm. These results  demonstrate that the SGN system can predict the intracranial acoustic field  according to transducer placement in real-time.","2023-11-15","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","120411","","","282","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

To achieve an ATP-detecting probe  resistant to ultrasound irradiation, we constructed a Cu/N-doped carbon  nanosphere (CNS), which has two fluorescence (FL) emissions at 438 and 578 nm to  detect ultrasound-regulated ATP release. The addition of ATP to Cu/N-doped CNS  was conducted to recover the FL intensity at 438 nm, where ATP enhanced the FL  intensity probably via intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) primarily and  hydrogen-bond-induced emission (HBIE) secondarily. The ratiometric probe was  sensitive to detect micro ATP (0.2-0.6 μM) with the limit of detection (LOD) of  0.068 μM. The detection of ultrasound-regulated ATP release by Cu,N-CNS/RhB  showed that ATP release was enhanced by the long-pulsed ultrasound irradiation at  1.1 MHz (+37%, p < 0.01) and reduced by the short-pulsed ultrasound irradiation  at 5 MHz (-78%, p < 0.001). Moreover, no significant difference in ATP release  was detected between the control group and the dual-frequency ultrasound  irradiation group (+4%). It is consistent with the results of ATP detection by  the ATP-kit. Besides, all-ATP detection was developed to prove that the CNS had  ultrasound-resistant properties, which means it could bear the irradiation of  focused ultrasound in different patterns and detect all-ATP in real time. In the  study, the ultrasound-resistant probe has the advantages of simple preparation,  high specificity, low limit of detection, good biocompatibility, and cell imaging  ability.

The primary outcome was  the difference from baseline to 36 months after FUS-STN in the score of the  Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)  motor part (III) for the treated hemibody in the off-medication state. The safety  outcome included all adverse events occurring during follow-up. Secondary  outcomes were the change in the MDS-UPDRS III score on-medication; subscores of  rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and axial features; total MDS-UPDRS III; and the  MDS-UPDRS part IV. Functional disability and quality of life were assessed using  the MDS-UPDRS II and the PDQ39, respectively. Patient impression of change and  satisfaction with the treatment were self-assessed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test  with subsequent Bonferroni's correction was used for data analysis. RESULTS:  Thirty-two patients with PD were evaluated at 36 months after treatment. The mean  (±SD) age at baseline was 56.0 ± 10.1 years, with a mean disease duration of 6.8  ± 2.8 years. The MDS-UPDRS III score for the treated hemibody off-medication was  improved by 52.3% from baseline to 3 years (score reduction from 19.0 ± 3.2 to  8.9 ± 3.3, 95% CI 8.7 to 11.6, p < 0.001), and all specific motor features were  improved from baseline. No disabling or delayed adverse events were reported. The  total MDS-UPDRS III off-medication score was 22.9% lower at 3 years than before  treatment (36.8 ± 7.4 vs 27.4 ± 6.2, 95% CI 6.0 to 11.5, p < 0.001). The  MDS-UPDRS II, IV, and PDQ39 scores and levodopa dose were equivalent to those at  baseline. DISCUSSION: The benefit of unilateral FUS-STN on PD motor features is  sustained in the long term. FUS-STN contributes to better clinical control over  several years of evolution. NCT02912871/03454425. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE:  This study provides Class IV evidence on the utility of focused ultrasound  unilateral subthalamotomy in the treatment of people with Parkinson disease.","2023-03-28","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e1395-e1405","","13","100","","Neurology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 American Academy of Neurology.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36631272  PMCID: PMC10065206","","","","*Deep Brain Stimulation; *Parkinson Disease/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/surgery; *Subthalamic Nucleus; Aged; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The currently FDA-approved AAV-vector based  gene therapies rely on naturally occurring serotypes, such as AAV2 or AAV9, which  display limited or no transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) if  systemically administered. Recently developed engineered AAV variants have shown  broad brain transduction and reduced off-target liver toxicity in non-human  primates (NHPs). However, these vectors lack spatial selectivity for targeted  gene delivery, a potentially critical limitation for delivering therapeutic doses  in defined areas of the brain. The use of microbubbles, in conjunction with  focused ultrasound (FUS), can enhance regional brain AAV transduction, but  methods to assess transduction in vivo are needed. Methods: In a murine model, we  combined positron emission tomography (PET) and optical imaging of reporter gene  payloads to non-invasively assess the spatial distribution and transduction  efficiency of systemically administered AAV9 after FUS and microbubble treatment.  Capsid and reporter probe accumulation are reported as percent injected dose per  cubic centimeter (%ID/cc) for in vivo PET quantification, whereas results for ex  vivo assays are reported as percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g). Results: In a  study spanning accumulation and transduction, mean AAV9 accumulation within the  brain was 0.29 %ID/cc without FUS, whereas in the insonified region of interest  of FUS-treated mice, the spatial mean and maximum reached ~2.3 %ID/cc and 4.3  %ID/cc, respectively. Transgene expression assessed in vivo by PET reporter gene  imaging employing the pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)/[(18)F]DASA-10 reporter system  increased up to 10-fold in the FUS-treated regions, as compared to mice receiving  AAVs without FUS. Systemic injection of AAV9 packaging the EF1A-PKM2 transgene  followed by FUS in one hemisphere resulted in 1) an average 102-fold increase in  PKM2 mRNA concentration compared to mice treated with AAVs only and 2) a  12.5-fold increase in the insonified compared to the contralateral hemisphere of  FUS-treated mice. Conclusion: Combining microbubbles with US-guided treatment  facilitated a multi-hour BBB disruption and stable AAV transduction in targeted  areas of the murine brain. This unique platform has the potential to provide  insight and aid in the translation of AAV-based therapies for the treatment of  neuropathologies.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","5151-5169","","15","13","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","eng","© The author(s).","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 37908737  PMCID: PMC10614693","","","","*Dependovirus/genetics; *Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Adeno-associated virus; Animals; Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism; Blood-brain barrier; Brain/diagnostic imaging/metabolism; Focused ultrasound; Gene therapy; Genetic Vectors; Mice; Positron emission tomography; Positron-Emission Tomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The volume of opening  determines the extent of therapeutic administration and sets a lower bound on the  size of targets which can be selectively treated. We tested a custom 1 MHz array  transducer optimized for cortical regions in the macaque brain with the goal of  achieving small volume openings. We integrated this device into a magnetic  resonance image guided focused ultrasound system and demonstrated twelve  instances of small volume BBB opening with average opening volumes of 59 ± 37 mm  (3) and 184 ± 2 mm (3) in cortical and subcortical targets, respectively. We  developed real-time cavitation monitoring using a passive cavitation detector  embedded in the array and characterized its performance on a bench-top flow  phantom mimicking transcranial BBB opening procedures. We monitored cavitation  during in-vivo procedures and compared cavitation metrics against opening volumes  and safety outcomes measured with FLAIR and susceptibility weighted MR imaging.  Our findings show small BBB opening at cortical targets in macaques and  characterize the safe pressure range for 1 MHz BBB opening. Additionally, we used  subject-specific simulations to investigate variance in measured opening volumes  and found high correlation (R (2) = 0.8577) between simulation predictions and  observed measurements. Simulations suggest the threshold for 1 MHz BBB opening  was 0.53 MPa. This system enables BBB opening for drug delivery and gene therapy  to be targeted to more specific brain regions.","2023-03-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: bioRxiv Pages: 2023.03.02.530815 Publication Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology PMID: 36909495  PMCID: PMC10002751","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, C6-ceramide-loaded nanoliposomes (CNLs), which rely upon  the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect for delivery, have shown  promise for treating solid tumors and are being tested in clinical trials. Here,  our objective was to determine whether CNLs synergize with TA in the control of  4T1 breast tumors. CNL-monotherapy of 4T1 tumors yielded significant intratumoral  bioactive C6 accumulation by the EPR effect, but tumor growth was not controlled.  TA increased bioactive C6 accumulation by ∼12.5-fold over the EPR effect. In  addition, TA+CNL caused shifts in long-chain to very-long-chain ceramide ratios  (i.e., C16/24 and C18/C24) that could potentially contribute to tumor control.  Nonetheless, these changes in intratumoral ceramide levels were still  insufficient to confer tumor growth control beyond that achieved when combining  with TA with control ""ghost"" nanoliposomes (GNL). While this lack of synergy  could be due to increased ""pro-tumor"" sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels, this  is unlikely because S1P levels exhibited only a moderate and statistically  insignificant increase with TA+CNL. In vitro studies showed that 4T1 cells are  highly resistant to C6, offering the most likely explanation for the inability of  TA to synergize with CNL. Thus, while our results show that sparse scan TA is a  powerful approach for markedly enhancing CNL delivery and generating ""anti-tumor""  shifts in long-chain to very-long-chain ceramide ratios, resistance of the tumor  to C6 can still be a rate-limiting factor for some solid tumor types.","2023-03-23","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: bioRxiv Pages: 2023.03.23.532394 Publication Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology PMID: 36993445  PMCID: PMC10055354","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although widely used in clinical practice, it remains  challenging to completely ablate the tumor margin due to fear of damaging the  surrounding tissues, thus leading to low efficacy and a series of complications.  Herein, we have developed novel pH-responsive drug-loading magnetosomes (STPSD  nanoplatform) for increasing the T(2)-contrast and improved the ablation  efficiency with a clinical MRgFUS system. Specifically, this STPSD nanoplatform  is functionalized by pH-responsive peptides (STP-TPE), encapsulating  superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and doxorubicin (DOX), which can cause drug  release and SPIO deposition at the tumor site triggered by acidity and MRgFUS.  Under MRgFUS treatment, the increased vascular permeability caused by  hyperthermia can improve the uptake of SPIO and DOX by tumor cells, so as to  enhance ultrasound energy absorption and further enhance the efficacy of  chemotherapy to completely ablate tumor margins. Moreover, we demonstrated that a  series of MR sequences including T(2)-weighted imaging (T(2)WI),  contrast-enhanced T(1)WI imaging (T(1)WI C+), maximum intensity projection (MIP),  volume rendering (VR) and ADC mapping can be further utilized to monitor the  MRgFUS ablation effect in rat models. Overall, this smart nanoplatform has the  capacity to be a powerful tool to promote the therapeutic MRgFUS effect and  minimize the side effects to surrounding tissues.","2023-10-24","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","7158-7168","","21","11","","Biomater Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37718624","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We selected male Sprague?Dawley rats as subjects and  performed transverse injuries on the T9 vertebra of their spinal cord (SC) to  build SCI. On the 7th day after SCI, LIFU treatment was performed below the SCI  segment once a day for 20 min, for 4 consecutive weeks. During treatment, a  pressure sensor was used to assess the degree of spasticity. After treatment, the  SC tissues from the treatment sites of the SCI+LIFU(-) and SCI+LIFU(+) groups  were extracted, and high-throughput sequencing was performed to identify the  changes in proteomics. In addition, expression of the growth associated protein  43 (Gap43) was validated by western blotting. RESULTS: The behavioral results  suggested that after 2 weeks of SCI, the rats were significantly induced to have  a spastic reaction (p < 0.05), while after 4 weeks of LIFU treatment, the spastic  response of rats was significantly improved (p < 0.05). Western blot analysis  showed a significant increase in Gap43 expression in the SCI+LIFU(-) group  compared with the sham group, whereas after 4 weeks of LIFU treatment, Gap43  protein expression was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The  results of this study showed that LIFU is an alternative treatment that can  effectively relieve spastic reactions caused by SCI, possibly by reducing  abnormal neuroplasticity or axon regeneration below the SCI segment.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","77-86","","1","33","","Turk Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Turkey PMID: 36066052","","","","*Muscle Spasticity/etiology/therapy/metabolism; *Spinal Cord Injuries/metabolism; Animals; Axons; Male; Nerve Regeneration; Proteomics; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Spinal Cord/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Resistant hypertension, a  condition with a prevalence of 10% to 20% in the general hypertensive population,  is more likely to experience poor outcomes and adverse cardiovascular events.  Renal sympathetic denervation (RDN), a minimally invasive, catheter-based  percutaneous intervention, has been considered for treating this condition.  Clinical trials have used various catheters, such as the Symplicity Spyral  catheter, Vessix Renal Denervation system, and Paradise endovascular ultrasound  renal denervation system. RECENT FINDINGS: After the first randomized clinical  trials examining the effectiveness and safety of RDN for lowering blood pressure  in hypertensive patients, new clinical trials have used various catheters based  on radiofrequency, such as the Spyral catheter, Vessix Renal Denervation system,  or based on radiofrequency as the Paradise endovascular ultrasound renal  denervation system. Positive results on this trials have shown that endovascular  RDN (radiofrequency energy or high focused ultrasound energy) could be considered  as a treatment option for uncontrolled resistant hypertension. SUMMARY:  Therefore, endovascular RDN (radiofrequency energy or high focused ultrasound  energy) could be considered as a treatment option for uncontrolled resistant  hypertension, which can be considered as an alternative to increasing medication.  Nevertheless more data are needed, mainly in cardiovascular outcomes. RDN should  be performed in experienced and specialized centers with a multidisciplinary  team, and the benefits and risks of RDN should be addressed in a  shared-decision-making process.","2023-11-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","544-550","","6","32","","Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Uniform treatment  and minimal adverse bioeffects are critical to achieve reliable doses and enable  safe routine use of this technique. Towards these aims, we have previously  designed a rapid short-pulse ultrasound sequence and used it to deliver a 3 kDa  model agent to mouse brains. We observed a homogeneous distribution in delivery  and blood-brain barrier closing within 10 min. However, many therapeutics and  imaging agents are larger than 3 kDa, such as antibody fragments and antisense  oligonucleotides. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of using rapid short-pulses  to deliver higher-molecular-weight model agents. 3, 10 and 70 kDa dextrans were  successfully delivered to mouse brains, with decreasing doses and more  heterogeneous distributions with increasing agent size. Minimal extravasation of  endogenous albumin (66.5 kDa) was observed, while immunoglobulin (~ 150 kDa) and  PEGylated liposomes (97.9 nm) were not detected. This study indicates that rapid  short-pulses are versatile and, at an acoustic pressure of 0.35 MPa, can deliver  therapeutics and imaging agents of sizes up to a hydrodynamic diameter between  8 nm (70 kDa dextran) and 11 nm (immunoglobulin). Increasing the acoustic  pressure can extend the use of rapid short-pulses to deliver agents beyond this  threshold, with little compromise on safety. This study demonstrates the  potential for deliveries of higher-molecular-weight therapeutics and imaging  agents using rapid short-pulses.","2023-04-28","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","6963","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Pentobarbital-loaded decafluorobutane nanodroplets (PBNDs) with a  Definity-derived lipid shell (237 nm; 4.08 × 10(9) particles/mL) were fabricated  and assessed. Change in droplet stability, concentration, and drug-release  efficacy were tested for PBNDs frozen at -80 °C over 4 weeks.

UFs are the most common benign tumors in women all over the world.  Clinical presentation, including abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), pelvic pain,  bulky symptoms, and infertility affect patients' quality of life, and a large  variety of conservative treatments are available especially for those with desire  of pregnancy. Fertility sparing surgery, by either laparoscopy, hysteroscopy or  laparotomy, or radiological interventions (uterine artery embolization,  high-intensity focused ultrasound or magnetic resonance-guided focused  ultrasound), are the most common therapeutic approaches. However, the genetic or  acquired predisposition to UFs remain despite the treatments, and the recurrences  are frequently described in a large percentage of patients. The most relevant  risk factors for recurrence of UFs are young age at the first surgery, incomplete  fibroid resection, the presence of multiple lesions, an enlarged uterus, and the  coexistence with other pelvic diseases. The discussion on the possible medical  strategy to reduce the recurrence is an open field of clinical investigation, in  particular by using hormonal drugs.","2023-12-18","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","Reprod Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Among the related techniques, focused ultrasound (FUS) is a favorite means of  enhancing drug delivery via transient BBB opening. Photoacoustic brain imaging  relies on the conversion of light into heat and the detection of ultrasound  signals from contrast agents, offering the benefits of high resolution and large  penetration depth. The extensive versatility and adjustable physicochemical  properties of nanoparticles make them promising therapeutic agents and imaging  probes, allowing for successful brain imaging and treatment through the combined  action of ultrasound and nanoparticulate agents. FUS-induced BBB opening enables  nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems to efficiently access the brain.  Moreover, photoacoustic brain imaging using nanoparticle-based contrast agents  effectively visualizes brain morphologies or diseases.

In this study, we propose a thin acrylic film as the  cheapest and most easily accessible phantom for assessing the functionality of  MRgFUS hardware and software. METHODS: Through the paper, specific QA tests are  detailed in the framework of evaluating an MRgFUS preclinical robotic device  comprising a single element spherically focused transducer with a nominal  frequency of 2.75 MHz. These tests take advantage of the reflection of ultrasonic  waves at a plastic-air interface, which results in almost immediate lesion  formation on the film at a threshold of applied acoustic energy. RESULTS: The  phantom offered qualitative information on the power field distribution of the  FUS transducer and the ability to visualize different FUS protocols. It also  enabled quick and reliable assessment of various navigation algorithms as they  are used in real treatments, and also allowed for the assessment of the accuracy  of robotic motion. CONCLUSION: Therefore, it could serve as a useful tool for  detecting defects in system's performance over its lifetime after establishing a  baseline while concurrently contributing to establish QA and calibration  guidelines for clinical routine controls.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","401-408","","2","26","","J Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Unfortunately, current clinical treatments for glioblastoma (GBM) are  lacking, leading to low long-term survival rates among patients. SDT is a  promising method for treating GBM in an effective, noninvasive, and  tumor-specific manner. Sonosensitizers preferentially enter tumor cells compared  to the surrounding brain parenchyma. The application of FUS in the presence of a  sonosensitizing agent generates reactive oxidative species resulting in  apoptosis. Although this therapy has been shown previously to be effective in  preclinical studies, there is a lack of established standardized parameters.  Standardized methods are necessary to optimize this therapeutic strategy for  preclinical and clinical use. In this paper, we detail the protocol to perform  SDT in a preclinical GBM rodent model using magnetic resonance-guided FUS  (MRgFUS). MRgFUS is an important feature of this protocol, as it allows for  specific targeting of a brain tumor without the need for invasive surgeries  (e.g., craniotomy). The benchtop device used here can focus on a specific  location in three dimensions by clicking on a target on an MRI image, making  target selection a straightforward process. This protocol will provide  researchers with a standardized preclinical method for MRgFUS SDT, with the added  flexibility to change and optimize parameters for translational research.","2023-02-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","DOI: 10.3791/65114 ISSN: 1940-087X Issue: 192 Journal Abbreviation: J Vis Exp Publication Title: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE PMID: 36847383","","","","*Brain Neoplasms/therapy/drug therapy; *Glioblastoma/diagnostic imaging/therapy; *Ultrasonic Therapy/methods; Animals; Brain/pathology; Cell Line, Tumor; Mice; Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inspection using high-frequency focused ultrasound has shown promise  for detecting defects of this size and geometry. However, implementing focused  ultrasound to inspect anisotropic media can prove challenging, given the  directional dependence of wave propagation and subsequent focusing behavior. In  this work, back surface-breaking defects at various orientations within silicon  wafers (0°, 15°, and 45° relative to the [010] crystallographic axis) are  experimentally inspected in an immersion tank setup. Using 100 MHz unfocused and  focused shear waves, the impact of medium anisotropy on focusing and defect  detection is evaluated. The scattering amplitude and defect detection sensitivity  results demonstrate orientation-dependent patterns that strongly rely on the use  of focused transducers. The defects along the 45° orientation reveal two-lobe  scattering patterns with maximum amplitudes less than half that of the defects in  the 0° orientation, which in contrast show a one-lobe scattering pattern. The  experimental results are further explored using finite element (FE) modeling and  ray tracing to visualize the impact of focusing on wave propagation within the  silicon. Ray tracing results show that the focused beam profiles for the 45° and  0° orientations form a butterfly wing and elliptical focusing profile,  respectively, which correspond directly to experimentally found scattering  patterns from defects. Additionally, the FE scattering results from unfocused  transducers reveal single lobe scattering for both 0° and 45° orientations,  proving the varying scattering patterns to be driven by the anisotropic focusing  behavior.","2023-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1506-1515","","11","70","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37782587","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although ADV has been  used widely in theranostic applications, ADV-induced bioeffects are understudied.  Here, we integrated ultra-high-speed microscopy, confocal microscopy, and focused  ultrasound for real-time visualization of ADV-induced mechanics and sonoporation  in fibrin-based, tissue-mimicking hydrogels. Three monodispersed phase-shift  droplets-containing perfluoropentane (PFP), perfluorohexane (PFH), or  perfluorooctane (PFO)-with an average radius of ∼6 μm were studied. Fibroblasts  and tracer particles, co-encapsulated within the hydrogel, were used to quantify  sonoporation and mechanics resulting from ADV, respectively. The maximum radial  expansion, expansion velocity, induced strain, and displacement of tracer  particles were significantly higher in fibrin gels containing PFP droplets  compared to PFH or PFO. Additionally, cell membrane permeabilization  significantly depended on the distance between the droplet and cell (d),  decreasing rapidly with increasing d. Significant membrane permeabilization  occurred when d was smaller than the maximum radius of expansion. Both  ultra-high-speed and confocal images indicate a hyper-local region of influence  by an ADV bubble, which correlated inversely with the bulk boiling point of the  phase-shift droplets. The findings provide insight into developing optimal  approaches for therapeutic applications of ADV.","2023-09-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","114101","","11","123","","Appl Phys Lett","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Author(s).","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37705893  PMCID: PMC10497320","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microbubble radiolabeling challenges contribute  to this void. This barrier is overcome by developing a one-pot, purification-free  copper chelation protocol able to stably radiolabel diverse  porphyrin-lipid-containing Definity® analogues (pDefs) with >95% efficiency while  maintaining microbubble physicochemical properties.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Between October 2015 and October 2021, a retrospective observational study was  conducted at the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, China, for  32 women with submucous leiomyomas who became pregnant after USgHIFU. Pregnancy  outcomes, submucous leiomyomas characteristics, and USgHIFU parameters were  analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 17 (53.1%) deliveries were successfully achieved,  with full-term delivery in 16 (94.1%) patients and preterm delivery in 1 (5.9%).  After USgHIFU, the effective volume in the uterus cavity and the volume of  submucous leiomyomas shrank in all 32 patients. The median time to achieve  pregnancy after USgHIFU was 11.0 months. Before pregnancy, myoma type was  downgraded in 13 (40.6%) patients, stable in 10 (31.3%) and upgraded in 9  (28.1%).

A new therapeutic approach for them consists of  providing specific drugs to the CNS through blood circulation; however, the  Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) prevents almost 100% of neurotherapeutics from reaching  the brain. There are indications that Focused Ultrasound (FUS), temporarily  placed in the BBB, can achieve a controlled increase in temperature at its focus,  allowing temporary, localized, and reversible opening of this barrier, which  facilitates the temporary delivery of specific drugs. This work presents a  FUS-based protocol for the local, temporary, and reversible opening of the BBB in  Wistar rats. The proposed protocol specifies certain power, treatment times, and  duty cycle to controllably increase the temperature at the region of interest,  i.e., the substantia nigra. Numerical simulations using commercial software based  on the finite element method were carried out to determine the optimal size of  the craniotomies for nearly full-acoustic transmission. Experiments in rats were  performed with the parameters used during computational simulations to determine  the adequate opening of the BBB. For this, craniotomies of different sizes were  made at coordinates of the substantia nigra, and FUS was applied from the  exterior. The opening of the BBB was evaluated using Evans Blue (EB) as an  indicator of the crossing of the dye from the blood vessels to brain tissue.  Numerical simulations demonstrated a major distance reached by the ultrasound  focus with a bigger diameter. Experimental results show the local, temporary, and  reversible opening of the BBB through a 10 mm diameter craniotomy, which  effectively allowed placing the ultrasound focus over the substantia nigra,  unlike a 6 mm diameter craniotomy in which there is a deviation of the focus  through that window. Moreover, from these results, it was also determined that  the disruption of the BBB was reversible, with an opening duration of 6 h after  FUS application. The experimental work developed in this study resulted in a  minimally invasive method for the temporary opening of the BBB.","2023-12-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","12","15","","Pharmaceutics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38140074  PMCID: PMC10748005","","","","Blood–Brain Barrier; craniotomy; focused ultrasound; reversible opening","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: A total of 17  participants (12 male, 5 female) with an average age of 58 y (range: 46-73 y)  were enrolled, including 11 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 2 patients  with hepatic metastasis and 4 patients with cholangiocarcinoma. The total volume  of tumor mass was 111.82 (11.01-272.30) cm(3). The average total ablation time  for a patient was 2021 ± 1030 s, and the energy efficiency factor was 5979.7  (3108.0, 45634.5) J/cm(3). Immediately after HIFU treatment, 1 patient (5.9%)  achieved complete response (CR), 4 patients (23.5%) had a moderate response, 8  patients (47.1%) had partial reperfusion and 4 patients (23.5%) had stable  disease (SD). The average ablation rate for all the tumors was 51.5 ± 26.7%. The  level of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT) was mildly increased in 71.6%  (12/17) of patients after HIFU therapy. Mean ALT values before and after  treatment were 22 (14, 35) U/L and 36 (25, 41) U/L, respectively (Z = 1.947,  p = 0.051). Mild or obvious edema in skin and subcutaneous soft tissues were  observed in 76.5% of patients, but no serious side effects were found. Twelve  months after treatment, the follow-up results revealed that 1 patient (5.8%)  achieved a CR, 8 patients (47.1%) had SD and 8 patients (47.1%) had progressive  disease. The estimated median time to progression was 11 mo after treatment, with  a 95% confidence interval of 6, 11 for all involved patients. CONCLUSION: Use of  Sonazoid is safe and feasible for improving HIFU ablation efficiency during the  treatment of advanced malignant liver lesions. The therapeutic efficacy of  Sonazoid-assisted HIFU needs to be explored in additional controlled clinical  investigations.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","134-141","","1","50","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Here we present the results of the first case  study evaluating the feasibility of non-thermal mechanical ablation of human  prostate adenocarcinoma tissue using the boiling histotripsy (BH) method on ex  vivo tissue. High intensity focused ultrasound field was generated using a  1.5-MHz custom-made transducer with nominal F#=0.75. A sonication protocol of  734 W acoustic power, 10-ms long BH-pulses, 30 pulses per focal spot, 1 % duty  cycle, and 1 mm distance between single foci was tested in an ex vivo human  prostate tissue sample containing PCa. The protocol used here has been  successfully applied in the previous BH studies for mechanical disintegration of  ex vivo prostatic human tissue with benign hyperplasia. BH treatment was  monitored using B-mode ultrasound. Post-treatment histologic analysis  demonstrated BH produced liquefaction of the targeted tissue volume. BH treated  benign prostate parenchyma and PCa had similar tissue fractionation into  subcellular fragments. The results of the study demonstrated that PCa tumor  tissue can be mechanically ablated using the BH method. Further studies will aim  on optimizing protocol parameters to accelerate treatment while maintaining  complete destruction of the targeted tissue volume into subcellular debris.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","107029","","","133","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Existing methods estimate  the specific absorption rate (SAR) from the temperature rise after a short power  pulse, which yields a biased estimate as thermal diffusion broadens the apparent  SAR pattern. To obtain an unbiased estimate, we propose a robust frequency-domain  method that simultaneously identifies the SAR as well as the thermal  dynamics.Methods: We propose a method consisting of periodic modulation of the  FUS power while recording the response with MR thermometry (MRT). This approach  enables unbiased measurements of spatial Fourier coefficients that encode the  thermal response. These coefficients are substituted in a generic thermal model  to simultaneously estimate the SAR, diffusivity, and damping. The method was  tested using a cylindrical phantom and a 3 T clinical MR-HIFU system. Three  scenarios with varying modulation strategies are chosen to challenge the method.  The results are compared to the well-known power pulse technique.Results: The  thermal diffusivity is estimated at 0.151 mm(2)s(-1) with a standard deviation of  0.01 mm(2)s(-1) between six experiments. The SAR estimates are consistent between  all experiments and show an excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to the  well established power pulse method. The frequency-domain method proved to be  insensitive to B(0)-drift and non steady-state initial temperature  distributions.Conclusion: The proposed frequency-domain estimation method shows a  high SNR and provided reproducible estimates of the SAR and the corresponding  thermal diffusivity. The findings suggest that frequency-domain tools can be  highly effective at estimating the SAR from (biased) MRT data acquired during  periodic power modulation.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2283388","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37994800","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; *Thermometry; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Phantoms, Imaging; Specific absorbtion rate; Temperature; Thermal Diffusion; focused ultrasound; parameter estimation; thermometry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An  iron-based coupling medium (IBCM) using iron oxide nanoparticles previously  developed by our group increased the relaxivity of the coupling bath such that it  appears to be invisible on MRI compared with degassed water. However, the  nanoparticles also reduced the pressure threshold for cavitation. To address this  concern for prefocal cavitation, our group recently developed an IBCM of  electrosterically stabilized and aggregation-resistant poly(methacrylic  acid)-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (PMAA-FeOX) with a similar capability to  reduce the MR signal of degassed water. This study examines the effect of the  PMAA-FeOX IBCM on the cavitation threshold. METHODS: Increasing concentrations of  PMAA-FeOX nanoparticles in degassed, deionized water were placed at the focus of  two different transducers to assess low and high duty-cycle pulsing parameters  which are representative of two modes of focused ultrasound being investigated  for tMRgFUS. Passive cavitation detection and high-speed optical imaging were  used to measure cavitation threshold pressures. RESULTS: The mean cavitation  threshold was determined in both cases to be indistinguishable from the degassed  water control, between 6-8 MPa for high duty-cycle pulsing (CW) and between  25.5-26.5 MPa for very low duty-cycle pulsing. CONCLUSION: The findings of this  study indicate that an IBCM of PMAA-FeOX nanoparticles is a possible solution to  reducing MRI interference from the coupling bath without increasing the risk of  prefocal cavitation.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2519-2526","","12","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Previous work  has shown that the acoustic emissions from cavitation can serve as ""point  sources"" for aberration correction (AC). This study compared the efficacy of soft  tissue AC for histotripsy using acoustic cavitation emissions (ACE) from bubble  cloud nucleation and collapse. METHODS: A 750-kHz, receive-capable histotripsy  array was pulsed to generate cavitation in ex vivo porcine liver through an  intervening abdominal wall. Received ACE signals were used to determine the  arrival time differences to the focus and compute corrective delays. Corrections  from single pulses and from the median of multiple pulses were tested.  DISCUSSION: On average, ACE AC obtained 96% ± 3% of the pressure amplitude  obtained by hydrophone-based correction (compared with 71% ± 5% without AC). Both  nucleation- and collapse-based corrections obtained >96% of the  hydrophone-corrected pressure when using medians of ≥10 pulses. When using  single-pulse corrections, nucleation obtained a range of 49%-99% of the  hydrophone-corrected pressure, while collapse obtained 95%-99%. CONCLUSION: The  results suggest that (i) ACE AC can recover nearly all pressure amplitude lost  owing to soft tissue aberration and that (ii) the collapse signal permits robust  AC using a small number of pulses.","2023-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1182-1193","","5","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Furthermore, C6-ceramide-loaded nanoliposomes (CNLs), which rely  upon the enhanced-permeation and retention (EPR) effect for delivery, have shown  promise for treating solid tumors and are being tested in clinical trials. Here,  our objective was to determine whether CNLs synergize with TA in the control of  4T1 breast tumors. CNL monotherapy of 4T1 tumors yielded significant intratumoral  bioactive C6 accumulation by the EPR effect, but tumor growth was not controlled.  TA increased bioactive C6 accumulation by ~ 12.5-fold over the EPR effect. In  addition, TA + CNL caused shifts in long-chain to very-long-chain ceramide ratios  (i.e., C16/24 and C18/C24) that could potentially contribute to tumor control.  Nonetheless, these changes in intratumoral ceramide levels were still  insufficient to confer tumor growth control beyond that achieved when combining  with TA with control ""ghost"" nanoliposomes (GNL). While this lack of synergy  could be due to increased ""pro-tumor"" sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels, this  is unlikely because S1P levels exhibited only a moderate and statistically  insignificant increase with TA + CNL. In vitro studies showed that 4T1 cells are  highly resistant to C6, offering the most likely explanation for the inability of  TA to synergize with CNL. Thus, while our results show that sparse scan TA is a  powerful approach for markedly enhancing CNL delivery and generating ""anti-tumor""  shifts in long-chain to very-long-chain ceramide ratios, resistance of the tumor  to C6 can still be a rate-limiting factor for some solid tumor types.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","3145-3153","","12","13","","Drug Deliv Transl Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

METHODS: A 3D segmented EPI pulse sequence was used  to simultaneously measure proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) MR thermometry  (MRT), T(1) relaxation time, and shear wave velocity induced by focused  ultrasound (FUS) push pulses. Experiments were performed in tissue mimicking  gelatin phantoms and ex vivo bovine liver. Using a carefully designed FUS  triggering scheme, a heating duty cycle of approximately 65% was achieved by  interleaving FUS ablation pulses with FUS push pulses to induce shear waves in  the tissue. RESULTS: In phantom studies, temperature increases measured with PRFS  MRT and increases in T(1) correlated with decreased shear wave velocity,  consistent with material softening with increasing temperature. During ablation  in ex vivo liver, temperature increase measured with PRFS MRT initially  correlated with increasing T(1) and decreasing shear wave velocity, and after  tissue coagulation with decreasing T(1) and increasing shear wave velocity. This  is consistent with a previously described hysteresis in T(1) versus PRFS curves  and increased tissue stiffness with tissue coagulation. CONCLUSION: An efficient  approach for simultaneous and dynamic measurements of PRSF, T(1) , and shear wave  velocity during treatment is presented. This approach holds promise for providing  co-registered dynamic measures of multiple parameters, which correlates to tissue  nonviability during and following thermal therapies, such as FUS.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2171-2185","","6","89","","Magn Reson Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36656135","","","","*Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Animals; Cattle; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Phantoms, Imaging; Protons; T1; Temperature; Ultrasonography; focused ultrasound; proton resonance frequency shift; shear-wave elastography; shear-wave velocity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the thermal and mechanical effects of ultrasound, the  system aims to deliver ultrasound energy to a target precisely without damaging  the normal tissue. The temperature elevation can be monitored in real time by  MRI, and the treatment plan can be adjusted during the procedure. The  requirements, design specifications, control system and registration of the  robotic system are specified. METHODS: The robotic system was designed with a 3  degrees of freedom manipulator with limit switches and encoders, a customised  MRI-compatible breast coil, a water bladder with sets of breast-conforming  brackets, and a probe capable of generating ultrasound. Twenty volunteers were  recruited for this study, and their data were analysed to provide more precise  data for the design. The accuracy of the robot was evaluated in free space using  a coordinate measuring machine, phantom and ex vivo porcine tissue in MRI room.  The study also verified the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the MRI with the  effect of the robotic system. RESULTS: The research findings revealed that the  manipulator exhibited a translational precision of 0.10 ± 0.14 mm, a rotational  fidelity around the X direction of 0.11 ± 0.09°, and an oscillatory exactness  around the Y direction of 0.10 ± 0.08°. The investigation of positioning accuracy  demonstrated that the robot's error in free space was 0.26 ± 0.07 mm. When  subjected to MRI room with agar-silica phantom and ex vivo porcine tissue, the  positioning accuracy amounted to 1.11 ± 0.47 mm and 1.57 ± 0.52 mm. In the  presence of the robotic system, the SNR of the MRI experienced a 4.2% reduction,  which had a negligible impact on image quality. CONCLUSIONS: The conducted  experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed MRI-guided HIFU robotic system  in executing agar-silica phantom and ex vivo porcine tissue investigations with  adequate positioning accuracy. Consequently, this system exhibits certain  feasibility for the treatment of breast fibroadenomas.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e2519","","4","19","","Int J Med Robot","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37081747","","","","*Fibroadenoma/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Robotic Surgical Procedures; Agar; Animals; Feasibility Studies; HIFU; MRI robot; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Phantoms, Imaging; Swine; breast fibroadenoma treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The transurethral identification of  the first thermal lesion generated by transrectal High Intensity Focused  Ultrasound (HIFU) for the treatment of prostate cancer, was used to preliminarily  test in silico the combined reconstruction method. The RTM method was optimised  by comparing reconstruction images from several cross-correlation techniques,  including a new proposed one, and different device configurations in terms of the  number and arrangement of emitters and receivers of the conceptual transurethral  probe. The best results were obtained for the new proposed cross-correlation  method and a device configuration with 3 emitters and 32 receivers. The RTM  reconstructions did not completely contour the shape of the HIFU lesion, however,  as planned for the combined approach, the areas in the RTM images with high level  of correlation were used to narrow down the search space in the GA-based  technique. The GA-based technique was set to find the location of the HIFU lesion  and the increment in stiffness and viscosity due to thermal damage. Overall, the  combined approach achieves lower level of error in the reconstructed values, and  in a shorter computational time, compared to the GA-based technique alone. The  lowest errors were accomplished for the location of HIFU lesion, followed by the  contrast ratio of stiffness between thermally treated tissue and non-treated  normal tissue. The homologous ratio of viscosity obtained higher level of error.  Further investigation considering diverse scenarios to be reconstructed and with  experimental data is required to fully evaluate the feasibility of the combined  approach.","2023-11-25","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","107206","","","138","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

While light is a conventional stimulus for remote  chemical activation, its penetration is severely attenuated in tissues, which  limits biological applicability. On the other hand, ultrasound is a biocompatible  remote energy source that is highly penetrant and offers a wide range of  functional tunability. Coupling ultrasound to the activation of specific chemical  reactions under physiological conditions, however, remains a challenge. Here, we  describe a synergistic platform that couples the selective mechanochemical  activation of mechanophore-functionalized polymers with biocompatible focused  ultrasound (FUS) by leveraging pressure-sensitive gas vesicles (GVs) as  acousto-mechanical transducers. The power of this approach is illustrated through  the mechanically triggered release of covalently bound fluorogenic and  therapeutic cargo molecules from polymers containing a masked 2-furylcarbinol  mechanophore. Molecular release occurs selectively in the presence of GVs upon  exposure to FUS under physiological conditions. These results showcase the  viability of this system for enabling remote control of specific mechanochemical  reactions with spatiotemporal precision in biologically relevant settings and  demonstrate the translational potential of polymer mechanochemistry.","2023-09-26","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e2309822120","","39","120","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37725651  PMCID: PMC10523651","","","","*Energy-Generating Resources; *Polymers; Transducers; Upper Extremity; drug delivery; focused ultrasound; gas vesicle; mechanophore; polymer mechanochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total  of 406 patients with uterine fibroids who underwent percutaneous ultrasound  ablation were analyzed retrospectively. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans before and after high-intensity focused  ultrasound. The abnormal signal intensity (low signal intensity on T1WI and high  signal intensity on T2WI) on the postoperative MRIs was indicative of a sacral  injury. The patients were divided into a sacrum injury group and a sacrum  non-injury group. The relationship between fibroid characteristics, ultrasound  ablation parameters, and injury was analyzed using univariate and multivariate  analyses. RESULTS: There were 139 cases of sacral injury (34.24%). When the  distance from the fibroid's dorsal side to the sacrum was 0-10 mm, the risk  assessment showed that the danger of sacral injury increased by 1.85 times and  3.03 times compared with that at a distance of 11-20 or 21-30 mm. Furthermore,  the risk of sacral injury increased by 1.89 times and 3.23 times when the  therapeutic dose (TD) of a fibroid was >500 KJ compared with that of a fibroid  with TD= 250-500 KJ and <250 KJ. CONCLUSION: A distance of 10 mm or less and a TD  of >500 KJ were significantly correlated with sacral injury. The distance from  the fibroid's dorsal side to the sacrum and the TD were the main causes of injury  to the sacrum. A distance of 10 mm or less and a TD of >500 KJ carried higher  injury risks, while a distance of 21-30 mm and a TD of <250 KJ were the most  appropriate circumstances to reduce the risk of sacral injury.","2023-01-31","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","195-201","","1","29","","Diagn Interv Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Turkey PMID: 36960616  PMCID: PMC10679587","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Leiomyoma/diagnostic imaging/surgery/pathology; *Uterine Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/surgery/pathology; Female; High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU); Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Retrospective Studies; Sacrum/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Treatment Outcome; magnetic resonance imaging; sacrum injury; ultrasound ablation; uterine fibroids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to construct  an optimal model for predicting NPVR based on T2-weighted magnetic resonance  imaging (T2MRI) radiomics features combined with clinical parameters by machine  learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted among 223  patients diagnosed with uterine fibroids from two centers. The patients from one  center were allocated to a training cohort (n = 122) and an internal test cohort  (n = 46), and the data from the other center (n = 55) was used as an external  test cohort. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)  algorithm was employed for feature selection in the training cohort. The support  vector machine (SVM) was adopted to construct a radiomics model, a clinical  model, and a radiomics-clinical model for NPVR prediction, respectively. The area  under the curve (AUC) and the decision curve analysis (DCA) were performed to  evaluate the predictive validity and the clinical usefulness of the model,  respectively. RESULTS: A total of 851 radiomic features were extracted from  T2MRI, of which seven radiomics features were screened for NPVR  prediction-related radiomics features. The radiomics-clinical model combining  radiomics features and clinical parameters showed the best predictive performance  in both the internal (AUC = 0.824, 95% CI 0.693-0.954) and external (AUC = 0.773,  95% CI 0.647-0.902) test cohorts, and the DCA also suggested the  radiomics-clinical model had the highest net benefit.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an effective and safe  treatment option for advanced pancreatic cancer, however, the survival time of  patients after the treatment was different. So, the purpose of this study was to  evaluate the relationship between the high-risk characteristics and prognosis of  unresectable pancreatic cancer after HIFU treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This  prospective study included 30 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer who  received HIFU at Beijing Friendship Hospital. Data on patients' tumor size, pain  scores, peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, CA19-9 and contrast enhanced  ultrasound (CEUS) features were collected to assess the relationship with overall  survival (OS) after HIFU. RESULTS: The median OS from the start of HIFU treatment  was 159 days, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 108-210. The levels of pain were  determined by visual analogue scale (VAS) score, and the quartile of the score  decreased from 6 (2, 7) to 4 (2, 5) immediately after one session of the  treatment (p = 0.001). The diagnostic model showed that high post VAS score and  decreasing of peripheral CD4(+) T cells were significantly correlated with poor  prognosis (p < 0.05), and showed good discrimination ability (AUC = 0.848, 95%  CI = 0.709-0.987). CONCLUSION: HIFU can effectively relieve pain in patients with  unresectable pancreatic cancer.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological features, laboratory  tests and follow-ups of 192 patients. Among the patients, 57 were treated with  HIFU prior to chemotherapy (HIFU-priority), and 135 patients received  chemotherapy followed by HIFU (HIFU-second). Univariate and multivariate Cox  regression analysis was used to determine the prognostic value of tumor  inflammation-related serological markers. A nomogram model was established based  on the identified prognostic factors. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that  receiving the treatment regimen in HIFU-priority was a significant protective  factor for overall survival (OS, p < 0.001). Tumor stage, high C-reactive protein  (CRP), high gamma-glutamyl transferase(γGT) high carbohydrate antigen 125  (CA125), high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), high lymphocyte-to-monocyte  ratio (LMR) and liver metastasis were significant risk factors for poor prognosis  (p < 0.05). CRP combined with normal tumor marker CA125 (CRP + CA125) was  associated with longer OS (p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis shows that  HIFU-priority is a protective factor for OS (Hazard Ratio, HR: 0.38; 95%  confidence interval(CI): 0.25-0.57), tumor stage (HR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.12-2.31),  CRP + CA125 (HR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.02-2.08) and γGT (HR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.04-1.98)  are risk factors for OS and serve as independent prognostic factors in the  nomogram. CONCLUSION: Early application of HIFU treatment improves the OS of  patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer.

However, real-time imaging and monitoring of the  therapeutic ultrasound delivered to the target area remain challenges for  precision breast cancer therapy. The main objective of this study is to propose  and evaluate a novel intelligence-based thermography (IT) method that can monitor  and control FUS treatment using thermal imaging with the fusion of artificial  intelligence (AI) and advanced heat transfer modeling. In the proposed method, a  thermal camera is integrated into FUS system for thermal imaging of the breast  surface, and an AI model is employed for the inverse analysis of the surface  thermal monitoring, thereby estimating the features of the focal region. This  paper presents experimental and computational studies conducted to assess the  feasibility and efficiency of IT-guided FUS (ITgFUS). Tissue phantoms, designed  to mimic the properties of breast tissue, were used in the experiments to  investigate detectability and the impact of temperature rise at the focal region  on the tissue surface. Additionally, an AI computational analysis employing an  artificial neural network (ANN) and FUS simulation was carried out to provide a  quantitative estimation of the temperature rise at the focal region. This  estimation was based on the observed temperature profile on the breast model's  surface. The results proved that the effects of temperature rise at the focused  area could be detected by the thermal images acquired with thermography.  Moreover, it was demonstrated that the AI analysis of the surface temperature  measurement could result in near real-time monitoring of FUS by quantitative  estimation of the temporal and spatial temperature rise profiles at the focal  region.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","107100","","","134","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Sixty-two patients with 85 uterine  leiomyomas were consecutively enrolled in this retrospective study and underwent  DTI scanning before HIFU treatment. Based on whether the non-perfused volume  ratio (NPVR) was greater than 70%, all patients were assigned to sufficient  ablation (NPVR ≥ 70%) or insufficient ablation (NPVR < 70%) groups. The selected  DTI indicators and imaging features were incorporated to construct a combined  model. The predictive performance of DTI indicators and the combined model were  assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: There  were 42 leiomyomas in the sufficient ablation group (NPVR ≥ 70%) and 43  leiomyomas in the insufficient ablation group (NPVR < 70%). The fractional  anisotropy (FA) and relative anisotropy (RA) values were higher in the sufficient  ablation group than in the insufficient ablation group (p < 0.05). Conversely,  the volume ratio (VR) and mean diffusivity (MD) values were lower in the  sufficient ablation group than those in the insufficient ablation group  (p < 0.05). Notably, the combined model composed of the RA and enhancement degree  values had high predictive efficiency, with an AUC of 0.915. The combined model  demonstrated higher predictive performance than FA and MD alone (p = 0.032 and  p < 0.001, respectively) but showed no significant improvement compared with RA  and VR (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: DTI indicators, especially the combined model  incorporating DTI indicators and imaging features, can be a promising imaging  tool to assist clinicians in predicting HIFU efficacy for uterine leiomyomas.","2023-03-13","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","Abdom Radiol (NY)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Treatment  strategies are limited, resulting in a median survival of only 11 months.  Currently, radiotherapy (RT), often combined with temozolomide, is considered the  standard of care but remains palliative, highlighting the urgency for new  therapies. Radiosensitisation by olaparib, an inhibitor of PARP1 and subsequently  PAR-synthesis, is a promising treatment option. We assessed whether PARP1  inhibition enhances radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo following focused  ultrasound mediated blood-brain barrier opening (FUS-BBBO). METHODS: Effects of  PARP1 inhibition were evaluated in vitro using viability, clonogenic, and  neurosphere assays. In vivo olaparib extravasation and pharmacokinetic profiling  following FUS-BBBO was measured by LC-MS/MS. Survival benefit of FUS-BBBO  combined with olaparib and RT was assessed using a patient-derived xenograft  (PDX) DMG mouse model. RESULTS: Treatment with olaparib in combination with  radiation delayed tumour cell proliferation in vitro through the reduction of  PAR. Prolonged exposure of low olaparib concentration was more efficient in  delaying cell growth than short exposure of high concentration. FUS-BBBO  increased olaparib bioavailability in the pons by 5.36-fold without observable  adverse effects. A Cmax of 54.09 μM in blood and 1.39 μM in the pontine region  was achieved following administration of 100 mg/kg olaparib. Although RT combined  with FUS-BBBO mediated olaparib extravasation delayed local tumour growth,  survival benefits were not observed in an in vivo DMG PDX model. CONCLUSIONS:  Olaparib effectively radiosensitises DMG cells in vitro and reduces primary  tumour growth in vivo when combined with RT. Further studies are needed to  investigate the therapeutic benefit of olaparib in suitable preclinical PDX  models.","2023-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","287-298","","","357","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Liposomes have the advantage of being able to encapsulate both  hydrophilic and hydrophobic functional substances and are thus important  mediators used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. It is important for liposomes to  have small sizes, uniform particle size distribution, and long-term stability.  Previously, liposomes have been prepared using a homo mixer, microfluidizer, and  horn and bath types of sonicators. However, it is difficult to produce liposomes  with small sizes and uniform particle size distribution using these methods.  Therefore, we have developed a focused ultrasound method to produce nano-sized  liposomes with better size control. In this study, the liposome solutions were  prepared using the focused ultrasound method and conventional methods. The  liposome solutions were characterized for their size distribution, stability, and  morphology. Results showed that the liposome solution prepared using focused  ultrasonic equipment had a uniform particle size distribution with an average  size of 113.6 nm and a polydispersity index value of 0.124. Furthermore, the  solution showed good stability in dynamic light scattering measurements for 4 d  and Turbiscan measurements for 1 week.","2023-09-22","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","19","13","","Nanomaterials (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37836259  PMCID: PMC10574396","","","","focused ultrasonication; nano liposome; stability; uniform size distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We  aimed to investigate oncological follow-up and safety data of focal  high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment. METHODS: We conducted a  single-center prospective study of 29 patients with PCa treated with (focal) HIFU  between 2016 and 2021. Inclusion criteria were unilateral PCa detected by  mpMRI-US-fusion prostate biopsy and maximum prostate specific antigen (PSA) of 15  ng/ml. Follow-up included mpMRI-US fusion-re-biopsies 12 and 24 months after  HIFU. No re-treatment of HIFU was allowed. The primary endpoint was failure-free  survival (FFS), defined as freedom from intervention due to cancer progression.  RESULTS: Median follow-up of all patients was 23 months, median age was 67 years  and median preoperative PSA was 6.8 ng/ml. One year after HIFU treatment PCa was  still detected in 13/ 29 patients histologically (44.8%). Two years after HIFU  another 7/29 patients (24.1%) were diagnosed with PCa. Until now, PCa recurrence  was detected in 11/29 patients (37.93%) which represents an FFS rate of 62%.One  patient developed local metastatic disease 2 years after focal HIFU. Adverse  events (AE) were low with 70% of patients remaining with sufficient erectile  function for intercourse and 97% reporting full maintenance of urinary  continence. CONCLUSION: HIFU treatment in carefully selected patients is  feasible. However, HIFU was oncologically not as safe as expected because of  progression rates of 37.93% and risk of progression towards metastatic disease.

This study explores behavioral effects  and hippocampal restoration induced by pulsed FUS in a kainic acid (KA) animal  model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Twenty-nine male Sprague-Dawley rats were  observed for 20 weeks with anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and  behavioral performance evaluations, comprising measures of anxiety, limb usage,  sociability, and memory. FUS targeted to the right hippocampus was given 9 and  14 weeks after KA was delivered to the right amygdala. Ultrasound pulsations were  delivered with the acoustic settings of 0.25 of mechanical index, 0.5 W/cm(2) of  intensity spatial peak temporal average (I(SPTA)), 100 Hz of pulse repetition  frequency, and 30% of duty cycle, during three consecutive pulse trains of 10 min  separated by 5-min rests. Controls included normal animals with sham injections  and KA-exposed animals without FUS exposure. Longitudinal MRI observations showed  that FUS substantially protected hippocampal and striatal structures from  KA-induced atrophy. KA alone increased anxiety, impaired contralateral limb  usage, and reduced sociability and learning. Two courses of FUS sonications  partially ameliorated these impairments by enhancing exploring and learning,  balancing limb usage, and increasing social interaction. The histology results  indicated that two sonications enhanced neuroprotection effect and decreased the  inflammation markers induced by KA.

Recent research suggests that  focused ultrasound might treat melasma effectively. OBJECTIVES: To investigate  the efficacy and safety of superficial micro-focused ultrasound with  visualization (MFU-V) for melasma in Asians. METHODS: Patients (n = 20) with  mixed melasma on both cheeks received 2 MFU-V treatments spaced 1 month apart. At  monthly visits over 5 months, treatment efficacy and safety were evaluated.  Standardized photographs were clinically assessed using the modified Melasma Area  and Severity Index (mMASI), and 6-point grading scales for melasma lightening and  area of involvement. Patients provided pain, global aesthetic improvement scale  (GAIS), and satisfaction assessments. RESULTS: In 40 cheeks, the mean mMASI score  was significantly reduced from 13.2 at baseline to 2.4 at month 4, and 2.8 at  month 5. Twenty-nine cheeks (72.5%) showed lightening of melasma at month 4 that  persisted until month 5, with improvements up to 75% compared to baseline.  Melasma area decreased overall, with sites containing >30% melasma involvement  decreasing from 55% to 20% by month 5, and none with 70%-89% involvement. Melasma  lightening and area improved visibly in 40% and 20% of cheeks, respectively, as  early as 1 month after index MFU-V treatment. Improvements continued after the  second treatment and persisted until study closure, correlating with patient GAIS  and satisfaction scores.

Monitoring of those effects is essential for improving the efficacy and safety of  HIFU interventions. Herein, we suggest a hybrid optoacoustic-ultrasound (OPUS)  approach for real-time assessment of heating and cavitation processes while  providing an essential anatomical reference for accurate localization of the  HIFU-induced lesion. Both effects could clearly be observed by exploiting the  temperature dependence of optoacoustic (OA) signals and the strong contrast of  gas bubbles in pulse-echo ultrasound (US) images. The differences in temperature  increase and its rate, as recorded with a thermal camera for different HIFU  pressures, evinced the onset of cavitation at the expected pressure threshold.  The estimated temperatures based on OA signal variations were also within 10-20 %  agreement with the camera readings for temperatures below the coagulation  threshold (∼50 °C). Experiments performed in excised tissues as well as in a  post-mortem mouse demonstrate that both heating and cavitation effects can be  effectively visualized and tracked using the OPUS approach. The good sensitivity  of the suggested method for HIFU monitoring purposes was manifested by a  significant increase in contrast-to-noise ratio within the ablated region by  > 10 dB and > 5 dB for the OA and US images, respectively. The hybrid OPUS-based  monitoring approach offers the ease of handheld operation thus can readily be  implemented in a bedside setting to benefit several types of HIFU treatments used  in the clinics.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","100508","","","31","","Photoacoustics","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 37228577  PMCID: PMC10203775","","","","High-intensity focused ultrasound treatment monitoring; Optoacoustic imaging; Photoacoustic imaging; Ultrasound imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HCC It ranges as the fifth most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide. While  The prognosis of metastatic or advanced HCC is still quite poor. Recently,  locoregional treatment, especially local ablation therapies, plays an important  role in the treatment of HCC. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and high-intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation are the most common-used methods effective and  feasible for treating HCC. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the  actions of ablation in the treatments for HCC and the HCC recurrence after  ablation still are poorly understood. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), the key  gene switch for adaptive responses to hypoxia, has been found to play an  essential role in the rapid aggressive recurrence of HCC after ablation  treatment. In this review, we summarized the current evidence of the roles of HIF  in the treatment of HCC with ablation. Fifteen relevant studies were included and  further analyzed. Among them, three clinical studies suggested that HIF-1α might  serve as a crucial role in the RAF treatment of HCC or the local recurrence of  HCC after RFA. The remainder included experimental studies demonstrated that  HIF-1, 2α might target the different molecules (e.g., BNIP3, CA-IX, and  arginase-1) and signaling cascades (e.g., VEGFA/EphA2 pathway), constituting a  complex network that promoted HCC invasion and metastasis after ablation.  Currently, the inhibitors of HIF have been developed, providing important proof  of targeting HIF for the prevention of HCC recurrence after IRFA and HIFU  ablation. Further confirmation by prospective clinical and in-depth experimental  studies is still warranted to illustrate the effects of HIF in HCC recurrence  followed ablation treatment in the future.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1086813","","","14","","Front Pharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Xiao, Liu, Ge, Jiang, Wang, Chen, Jin, Mo, Li, Wang, Zhang and Zhou.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36814489  PMCID: PMC9939531","","","","ablation; hepatocellular carcinoma; hypoxia-inducible factor; mechanism; therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous systematic reviews  supported evidence for favorable functional outcomes, but oncological outcomes  were inconclusive owing to limited follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the  real-world data on the mid- to long-term oncological and functional outcomes of  whole-gland cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in patients  with clinically localized PCa, and to provide expert recommendations and  commentary on these findings. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic  review of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library publications through February 2022  according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. As endpoints, baseline clinical  characteristics, and oncological and functional outcomes were assessed. To  estimate the pooled prevalence of oncological, functional, and toxicity outcomes,  and to quantify and explain the heterogeneity, random-effect meta-analyses and  meta-regression analyses were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-nine studies  were identified, including 14 on cryoablation and 15 on HIFU with a median  follow-up of 72 mo. Most of the studies were retrospective (n = 23), with IDEAL  (idea, development, exploration, assessment, and long-term study) stage 2b  (n = 20) being most common. Biochemical recurrence-free survival, cancer-specific  survival, overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and metastasis-free  survival rates at 10 yr were 58%, 96%, 63%, 71-79%, and 84%, respectively.  Erectile function was preserved in 37% of cases, and overall pad-free continence  was achieved in 96% of cases, with a 1-yr rate of 97.4-98.8%. The rates of  stricture, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, rectourethral fistula, and  sepsis were observed to be 11%, 9.5%, 8%, 0.7%, and 0.8%, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: The mid- to long-term real-world data, and the safety profiles of  cryoablation and HIFU are sound to support and be offered as primary treatment  for appropriate patients with localized PCa. When compared with other existing  treatment modalities for PCa, these ablative therapies provide nearly equivalent  intermediate- to long-term oncological and toxicity outcomes, as well as  excellent pad-free continence rates in the primary setting. This real-world  clinical evidence provides long-term oncological and functional outcomes that  enhance shared decision-making when balancing risks and expected outcomes that  reflect patient preferences and values. PATIENT SUMMARY: Cryoablation and  high-intensity focused ultrasound are minimally invasive treatments available to  selectively treat localized prostate cancer, considering their nearly comparable  intermediate- to long term cancer control and preservation of urinary continence  to other radical treatments in the primary setting. However, a well-informed  decision should be made based on one's values and preferences.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","547-560","","6","84","","Eur Urol","","","","","","","","eng","Published by Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37419773","","","","*Cryosurgery/adverse effects; *Prostatic Neoplasms/surgery; Ablation therapy; Best practice statement; Cryotherapy; Focal Therapy Society; Functional outcomes; High-intensity focused ultrasound; Humans; Male; Oncological outcomes; Prostate cancer; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Whole-gland ablation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ureteral stents are small conduits connecting the kidney  and the bladder. They have been widely used to treat ureteral obstructions and  ureteral leaks. The most problematic and frequent stent-associated complication  is stent encrustation. This occurs when mineral crystals (e.g. calcium, oxalate,  phosphorus, struvite) are deposited onto the surface and internal lumen of the  stent. Encrustation can lead to the obstruction of a stent and increases risk of  systemic infection. As a result, ureteral stents need to be replaced typically  every 2-3 months. PURPOSE: In this study, we present a non-invasive,  high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)-based technique to recanalize obstructed  stents. By taking advantage of the mechanical force produced by a HIFU beam,  including acoustic radiation force, acoustic streaming, and cavitation, HIFU can  break up encrustations, clearing the stent of obstruction. METHODS: The ureteral  stents for this study were obtained from patients undergoing ureteral stent  removal. Under the guidance of ultrasound imaging, the encrustation in the stents  were located, and then targeted by HIFU at frequencies of 0.25 and 1 MHz. The  duty cycle of HIFU was 10%, and the HIFU burst repetition rate was 1 Hz, while  the HIFU amplitude was varied to find the threshold pressure that would displace  encrustations. The treatment duration was limited at 2 min (or 120 shots from  HIFU). The treatments were carried out in two different orientations (parallel  and perpendicular) of the ureteral stent with respect to the HIFU beam. For each  setting, five treatments were conducted for a maximum duration of 2 min. During  the entire treatment, an ultrasound imaging system was used to monitor the  movement of encrustations inside the stent. The peak negative HIFU pressures  needed to move the encrustations inside the stent was recorded for quantitative  analysis. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that at both 0.25 and 1 MHz  ultrasound frequencies, obstructed stents could be recanalized. At 0.25 MHz, the  needed average peak negative pressure was 0.52 MPa in parallel orientation and  0.42 MPa in perpendicular orientation. At 1 MHz, the needed average peak negative  pressure was 1.10 MPa in parallel orientation and 1.15 MPa in perpendicular  orientation CONCLUSIONS: This first in-vitro study has demonstrated the  feasibility of non-invasive HIFU to recanalize ureteral stents. This technology  has a potential to reduce the need for ureteral stent exchange.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","7349-7358","","12","50","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37153961","","","","*Ureter/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Ureteral Obstruction/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Humans; Kidney; Stents/adverse effects; biofilm; encrustation; high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU); ureteral stent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, traditional HIFU, based on thermal effects, has a  high local working temperature, which may cause thermal damage to surrounding  tissues and reduce the therapeutic effect. Based on the cavitation effect of  HIFU, histotripsy can mechanically destroy the cells in the target lesion. This  paper aims to explain the mechanism of histotripsy, summarize the research  progress of animal models for clinical evaluation and clinical application, and  analyze the advantages and limitations of histotripsy. METHODS: Literature  published from January 2006 to March 2022 was retrieved from the PubMed database.  We reviewed these articles to examine histotripsy from the aspects of the  mechanism, animal experiments, clinical trials, advantages, disadvantages, and  optimization. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Histotripsy is a noninvasive,  nonionizing, nonthermal ablation technique. The clinical application of  histotripsy has made significant progress in the treatment of liver tumors,  benign prostatic hyperplasia, and aortic valve calcification stenosis. Phase I  clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of histotripsy in the  treatment of these diseases. More research is needed to evaluate and optimize its  efficacy and safety and to fully explore its mechanism of action, pathological  and immunological effects, and the short-term and long-term reactions of the body  after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Histotripsy has broad application prospects in  ablation therapy and will benefit patients after more clinical trials are  conducted in the future.","2023-03-31","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","263","","6","11","","Ann Transl Med","","","","","","","","eng","2023 Annals of Translational Medicine.

SDT uses ultrasound  waves in combination with a sonosensitizer to selectively damage cancer cells,  while MRgFUS delivers high-intensity ultrasound waves to precisely target tumor  tissue and disrupt the blood-brain barrier to enhance drug delivery. In this  review, we explore the potential of SDT as a novel therapeutic strategy for GB.  We discuss the principles of SDT, its mechanisms of action, and the preclinical  and clinical studies that have investigated its use in Gliomas. We also highlight  the challenges, the limitations, and the future perspectives of SDT. Overall, SDT  and MRgFUS hold promise as novel and potentially complementary treatment  modalities for GB.

This systematic review and  meta-analysis (CRD42022297312) aims to assess and compare reproductive and  obstetric outcomes in women who underwent these minimally invasive approaches for  uterine fibroids. The search was performed in PubMed, Google Scholar,  ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Risk of bias  was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Cochrane guidelines. The  articles were selected to meet the following eligibility criteria: (1) research  article, (2) human subject research, and (3) the study of pregnancy outcomes  after the treatment of uterine fibroids by either one of three methods-UAE, HIFU,  and TFA. The analysis of 25 eligible original articles shows a similar rate of  live births for UAE, USgHIFU, MRgHIFU, and TFA (70.8%, 73.5%, 70%, and 75%,  respectively). The number of pregnancies varied considerably among these studies,  as well as the mean age of pregnant women. However, the results of pregnancy  outcomes for TFA are insufficient to draw firm conclusions, since only 24 women  became pregnant in these studies, resulting in three live births. The miscarriage  rate was highest in the UAE group (19.2%). USgHIFU was associated with a higher  rate of placental abnormalities compared to UAE (2.8% vs. 1.6%). The pooled  estimate of pregnancies was 17.31% to 44.52% after UAE, 18.69% to 78.53% after  HIFU, and 2.09% to 7.63% after TFA. The available evidence confirmed that these  minimally invasive uterine-sparing treatment options for uterine fibroids are a  good approach for patients wishing to preserve their fertility, with comparable  reproductive and obstetric outcomes among the different techniques.","2023-03-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","5","20","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36901489  PMCID: PMC10001943","","","","*Leiomyoma; *Uterine Artery Embolization/methods; *Uterine Neoplasms; Female; Humans; MRgHIFU; Placenta; Pregnancy; Treatment Outcome; UAE; USgHIFU; leiomyoma; pregnancy; transcervical radiofrequency ablation; uterine fibroids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

HIFU is a minimally  invasive technique that relies on the thermo-mechanical effects of focused  ultrasound waves to perform clinical treatments, such as tumor ablation, mild  hyperthermia adjuvant to radiation or chemotherapy, vein occlusion, and many  others. HIFU is typically performed under ultrasound (USgHIFU) or magnetic  resonance imaging guidance (MRgHIFU), which provide intra-operative monitoring of  treatment outcomes. Robot-assisted HIFU probe manipulation provides precise HIFU  focal control to avoid damage to surrounding sensitive anatomy, such as blood  vessels, nerve bundles, or adjacent organs. These clinical and technical benefits  have promoted the rapid adoption of robot-assisted HIFU in the past several  decades. This paper aims to present the recent developments of robot-assisted  HIFU by summarizing the key features and clinical applications of each system.  The paper concludes with a comparison and discussion of future perspectives on  robot-assisted HIFU.","2023-04-03","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","7","23","","Sensors (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37050766  PMCID: PMC10098661","","","","*Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Robotics; Fever; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; high-intensity focused ultrasound; image-guided therapy; robot-assisted HIFU","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
