This study explores the efficacy and time course of  a short series of pulsed FUS in suppressing EEG epileptiform spikes/bursts in a  kainic acid (KA) animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Forty-four male  Sprague-Dawley rats were recorded for 14 weeks with EEG while software calculated  EEG numbers of epileptiform spikes and bursts (≥ 3 spikes/s). Four regimens of  FUS given in a single session at week 7 were evaluated, with mechanical index  (MI) ranging from 0.25 to 0.75, intensity spatial peak temporal average (I(SPTA))  from 0.1 to 2.8 W per cm(2), duty cycle from 1 to 30%, and three consecutive  pulse trains for 5 or 10 min each. Controls included sham injections in four and  KA without FUS in eleven animals. Histological analysis investigated tissue  effects. All animals receiving KA evidenced EEG spikes, averaging 10,378 ± 1651  spikes per 8 h and 1255 ± 199 bursts per 8 h by weeks 6-7. The KA-only group  showed a 30% of increase in spikes and bursts by week 14. Compared to the KA-only  group, spike counts were reduced by about 25%, burst counts by about 33%, and  burst durations by about 50% with FUS. Behavioral seizures were not analyzed, but  electrographic seizures longer than 10 s declined up to 70% after some FUS  regimens. Repeated-measure ANOVA showed a significant effect of higher intensity  and longer sonication duration FUS treatment using 0.75-MI, I(SPTA) 2.8 W/cm(2),  30% duty cycle for 10-min sonications (group effect, F (4, 15) = 6.321, p < 0.01;  interaction effect, F (44, 165) = 1.726, p < 0.01), with the hippocampal  protective effect lasting to week 14, accompanied by decreased inflammation and  gliosis effect. In contrast, spike and burst suppression were achieved using an  FUS regimen with 0.25-MI I(SPTA) 0.5 W/cm(2), 30% duty cycle for 10-min  sonications. This regimen reduced inflammation and gliosis at weeks 8-14 and  protected hippocampal tissue. This study demonstrates that low-intensity pulsed  ultrasound can modulate epileptiform activity for up to 7 weeks and, if  replicated in the clinical setting, might be a practical treatment for epilepsy.","2022-05-17","2024-03-06 17:10:48","2024-03-06T17:10:48Z","","","","","","","Neurotherapeutics","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Ultrasound exposure in the presence of microbubbles has  emerged as an effective method to transiently and locally increase the  permeability of the BBB, facilitating para- and transcellular transport of drugs  across the BBB. Imaging the vasculature during ultrasound-microbubble treatment  will provide valuable and novel insights on the mechanisms and dynamics of  ultrasound-microbubble treatments in the brain. Here, we present an experimental  procedure for intravital multiphoton microscopy using a cranial window aligned  with a ring transducer and a 20x objective lens. This set-up enables high spatial  and temporal resolution imaging of the brain during ultrasound-microbubble  treatments. Optical access to the brain is obtained via an open-skull cranial  window. Briefly, a 3-4 mm diameter piece of the skull is removed, and the exposed  area of the brain is sealed with a glass coverslip. A 0.82 MHz ring transducer,  which is attached to a second glass coverslip, is mounted on top. Agarose (1%  w/v) is used between the coverslip of the transducer and the coverslip covering  the cranial window to prevent air bubbles, which impede ultrasound propagation.  When sterile surgery procedures and anti-inflammatory measures are taken,  ultrasound-microbubble treatments and imaging sessions can be performed  repeatedly over several weeks. Fluorescent dextran conjugates are injected  intravenously to visualize the vasculature and quantify ultrasound-microbubble  induced effects (e.g., leakage kinetics, vascular changes). This paper describes  the cranial window placement, ring transducer placement, imaging procedure,  common troubleshooting steps, as well as advantages and limitations of the  method.","2022-02-05","2024-03-06 17:10:45","2024-03-06T17:10:45Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","DOI: 10.3791/62235 ISSN: 1940-087X Issue: 180 Journal Abbreviation: J Vis Exp Publication Title: Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE PMID: 35188113","","","","*Blood-Brain Barrier/diagnostic imaging; *Microbubbles; Biological Transport; Drug Delivery Systems; Microscopy; Permeability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the related techniques, focused ultrasound (FUS) is a favorite means of  enhancing drug delivery via transient BBB opening. Photoacoustic brain imaging  relies on the conversion of light into heat and the detection of ultrasound  signals from contrast agents, offering the benefits of high resolution and large  penetration depth. The extensive versatility and adjustable physicochemical  properties of nanoparticles make them promising therapeutic agents and imaging  probes, allowing for successful brain imaging and treatment through the combined  action of ultrasound and nanoparticulate agents. FUS-induced BBB opening enables  nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems to efficiently access the brain.

Usually, they are associated  with prolonged heavy bleeding during the menstrual period, sacral pain, and  increased frequency of UTIs, secondary dysmenorrhea, constipation, and  pregnancy-associated problems. It also impacts usual activities, which lead to  diminished quality of life and rising healthcare costs. Generally, surgery is the  only choice for uterine fibroids; however, MR-HIFU is an entirely non-invasive  novel therapy, preferred in pregnancy desiring females. AIM: To re-evaluate the  efficacy of magnetic resonance-high intensity focused ultrasound (MRHIFU) therapy  for uterine fibroids. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs),  prospective or retrospective non-randomized, and cross-over studies that  considered clinically symptomatic uterine fibroid treatment were included.  Meta-analysis was performed using NCSS software, and data were analyzed at a 95%  confidence level with a significance level of 0.05. In addition, the non-perfused  volume percentage (NPV%), transformed Symptom Severity Score percentage change  (tSSS change%), and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) were computed.  RESULTS: The overall effect of NPV% was 67.60%, where the 95% confidence interval  ranged from 55.58% to 79.62%. The overall impact of tSSS% change was  approximately 50% (0.54) with 95% CI of 0.41-0.66 of 3 months, 6 months, and 12  months in the included studies.

The currently available revascularisation methods have an acceptable  initial success rate, but the long-term patency is limited, while surgical  revascularisation is associated with a relatively high perioperative risk. This  urges the need for development of less invasive and more effective treatment  modalities. This protocol article describes a study investigating a new  non-invasive technique that uses robot assisted high-intensity focused ultrasound  (HIFU) to treat atherosclerosis in the femoral artery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A  pilot study is currently performed in 15 symptomatic patients with PAD with a  significant stenosis in the common femoral and/or proximal superficial femoral  artery. All patients will be treated with the dual-mode ultrasound array system  to deliver imaging-guided HIFU to the atherosclerotic plaque. Safety and  feasibility are the primary objectives assessed by the technical feasibility of  this therapy and the 30-day major complication rate as primary endpoints.  Secondary endpoints are angiographic and clinical success and quality of life.  ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study was obtained in 2019  from the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht, the  Netherlands.

This study investigated the effects of tFUS on BBB opening, regional  cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglu), and cognitive function in AD  patients. Eight patients with AD received image-guided tFUS to the right  hippocampus immediately after intravenous injection of microbubble ultrasound  contrast agents. Patients completed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),  (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), and cognitive  assessments before and after the sonication. No evidence of transient BBB opening  was found on T1 dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. However, immediate recall (p =  0.03) and recognition memory (p = 0.02) were significantly improved on the verbal  learning test. PET image analysis demonstrated increased rCMRglu in the right  hippocampus (p = 0.001). In addition, increases of hippocampal rCMRglu were  correlated with improvement in recognition memory (Spearman's ρ = 0.77, p =  0.02). No adverse event was observed. Our results suggest that tFUS to the  hippocampus of AD patients may improve rCMRglu of the target area and memory in  the short term, even without BBB opening. Further larger sham-controlled trials  with loger follow-up are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tFUS in  patients with AD.","2022-02-09","2024-03-06 17:10:31","2024-03-06T17:10:31Z","","","","2","12","","J Pers Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 35207738  PMCID: PMC8878180","","","","Alzheimer’s disease; blood–brain barrier; cognition; regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose; transcranial focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we  revised the available evidence to present an expert opinion that could support  physicians, patients and policy-makers for considering this approach in other  populations. We revisited systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials and  cohort studies from January 2018 to August 2021 using PubMed and Google scholar,  regarding short and long term outcomes after ablation with focused ultrasound  waves. In total, 33 studies, including 114,810 adult patients showed that  outcomes of this approach depend on several parameters directly related with  resistance to thermal ablation, especially fibroid size and vascularization. Two  studies report satisfactory outcomes in Afro-American women. In accordance to the  technique used, fibroid volume reduction showed to be higher in fibroids <300  cm(3) after ultrasound guided HIFU than after MRI guided. Compared to myomectomy  and uterine artery embolization, HIFU seems to have shorter hospital stay, higher  pregnancy rates and similar adverse events rates, with skin burn being the most  reported. Symptoms and quality of life improvement is similar to myomectomy but  lower than embolization, however reintervention rate is higher after HIFU. Lacks  evidence about long-term sarcoma risk after ablation.

Depending on the strain and size, important variables  include ultrasound attenuation and sound field distortion caused by the skull. We  examined the ultrasound attenuation of the skull of Wistar rats using a targeted  FUS system. By modifying the transducer elements and by varying and simulating  the acoustic field of the FUS system, we measured a skull attenuation of about  60%. To evaluate potential application of the targeted FUS system in genetically  modified animals with increased sensitivity to brain hemorrhage caused by  vascular dysfunction, we assessed safety in healthy animals. Histological and MRI  analyses of the central nervous system revealed an increase in the number and  severity of hyperacute bleeds with focal pressure. At a pressure of 0.4 MPa, no  bleeds were induced, albeit at the cost of a weaker hyperintense MRI signal post  BBBo.

Focused ultrasound hyperthermia (HT)  combined with thermosensitive therapeutics have been demonstrated promising in  enhancing local drug delivery to solid tumors. We hypothesized that the presence  of microbubbles (MBs) combined with transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound  (MRgFUS) could be used to reduce the ultrasound power required for HT while  simultaneously increasing drug delivery by locally opening the blood-brain  barrier (BBB). METHODS: Transcranial HT (42 °C, 10 min) was performed in  wild-type mice using a small animal MRgFUS system incorporated into a 9.4T Bruker  MR scanner, with infusions of saline or Definity MBs with doses of 20 or 100  µl/kg/min (denoted as MB-20 and MB-100). MR thermometry data was continuously  acquired as feedback for the ultrasound controller during the procedure. RESULTS:  Spatiotemporally precise transcranial HT was achieved in both saline and MB  groups. A significant ultrasound power reduction (-45.7%, p = 0.006) was observed  in the MB-20 group compared to saline. Localized BBB opening was achieved in MB  groups confirmed by CE-T1w MR images. There were no structural abnormalities,  edema, hemorrhage, or acutemicroglial activation in all groups, confirmed by T2w  MR imaging and histology. CONCLUSION: Our investigations showed that it is  feasible and safe to achieve spatiotemporally precise brain HT at significantly  reduced power and simultaneous localized BBB opening via transcranial MRgFUS and  MBs.

Brain cancer management via blood-based liquid biopsies is a minimally  invasive alternative; however, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the  release of brain tumor-derived molecular biomarkers necessary for sensitive  diagnosis. Methods: A mouse glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model was used to  demonstrate the capability of focused ultrasound (FUS)-enabled liquid biopsy  (sonobiopsy) to improve the diagnostic sensitivity of brain tumor-specific  genetic mutations compared with conventional blood-based liquid biopsy.  Furthermore, a pig GBM model was developed to characterize the translational  implications of sonobiopsy in humans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided FUS  sonication was performed in mice and pigs to locally enhance the BBB permeability  of the GBM tumor. Contrast-enhanced T(1)-weighted MR images were acquired to  evaluate the BBB permeability change. Blood was collected immediately after FUS  sonication. Droplet digital PCR was used to quantify the levels of brain  tumor-specific genetic mutations in the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).  Histological staining was performed to evaluate the potential for off-target  tissue damage by sonobiopsy. Results: Sonobiopsy improved the detection  sensitivity of EGFRvIII from 7.14% to 64.71% and TERT C228T from 14.29% to 45.83%  in the mouse GBM model. It also improved the diagnostic sensitivity of EGFRvIII  from 28.57% to 100% and TERT C228T from 42.86% to 71.43% in the porcine GBM  model. Conclusion: Sonobiopsy disrupts the BBB at the spatially-targeted brain  location, releases tumor-derived DNA into the blood circulation, and enables  timely collection of ctDNA.

Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) involves systemic delivery  of non-toxic chemical agents (sonosensitizers) that accumulate in tumor cells or  environment and are subsequently activated by exposure to low-frequency ultrasound  to become cytotoxic agents. Herein, we discuss proposed mechanisms of action of SDT  and provide recommendation for future research and clinical applications of SDT for  gliomas. METHODS: Review of literature of SDT in glioma cell cultures and animal  models published in Pubmed/MEDLINE before January, 2021. RESULTS: Different  porphyrin and xanthene derivatives have proven to be effective sonosensitizers.  Generation of reactive oxygen species and free radicals from water pyrolysis or  sonosensitizers, or physical destabilization of cell membrane, have been identified  as mechanisms of SDT leading to cell death. Numerous studies across glioma cell  lines using various sonosensitizers and ultrasound parameters have documented  tumoricidal effects of SDT. Studies in small animal glioma xenograft models have  also consistently documented that SDT is associated with improved tumor control and  longer survival of animals treated with SDT while avoiding damage of surrounding  brain. There are no clinical trials completed to date regarding safety and efficacy  of SDT in patients harboring gliomas, but some are beginning. CONCLUSIONS:  Pre-clinical studies cell cultures and animal models indicate that SDT is a  promising treatment approach for gliomas. Further studies should define optimal  sonication parameters and sonosensitizers for gliomas. Clinical trials of SDT in  patients harboring gliomas and other malignant brain tumors are currently underway.","2022-01","2024-03-06 17:10:20","2024-03-06T17:10:20Z","","1-10","","1","156","","J Neurooncol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

Although many alternative non-invasive solid  tumor therapies have been proposed through the years and continue to be tested in  various contexts, tumor cell eradication remains a daunting task for the current  cancer armamentarium. Indeed, solid tumors exhibit physically and biochemically  heterogenous microenvironments, allowing them to easily acquire resistance  mechanisms. Progress in sonodynamic therapy (SDT), a treatment modality capable  of controlling tumor growth while limiting off-target effects and toxicities, has  accelerated in recent years. SDT combines ""sonosensitizing"" agents with the  non-invasive application of focused acoustic energy [i.e. focused ultrasound  (FUS)] to drive highly localized formation of tumor cell-killing reactive oxygen  species (ROS). Sonosensitizers selectively accumulate in tumor cells, after which  FUS radiation eliminates the tumor by forcing the tumor cells to undergo cell  death. In this article, we comprehensively review recent studies wherein SDT has  been applied to treat primary and metastatic tumors. We discuss sonosensitizers,  combination therapies with SDT, developments in defining the mechanism of  SDT-induced cell cytotoxicity, and the promise SDT offers as a modulator of  anti-tumor immunity.","2022-04-28","2024-03-06 17:10:17","2024-03-06T17:10:17Z","","215592","","","532","","Cancer Lett","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional hydrogels are designed a priori, with  characteristics that cannot be dynamically changed in an externally controlled,  user-defined manner. We developed a composite hydrogel, termed an  acoustically-responsive scaffold (ARS), that enables non-invasive,  spatiotemporally controlled modulation of mechanical and morphological properties  using focused ultrasound. An ARS consists of a phase-shift emulsion distributed  in a fibrin matrix. Ultrasound non-thermally vaporizes the emulsion into bubbles,  which induces localized, radial compaction and stiffening of the fibrin matrix.  In this in vitro study, we investigate how this mechanism can control the  differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, a transition correlated with  substrate stiffness on 2D substrates. Matrix compaction and stiffening was shown  to be highly localized using confocal and atomic force microscopies,  respectively. Myofibroblast phenotype, evaluated by α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)  immunocytochemistry, significantly increased in matrix regions proximal to  bubbles compared to distal regions, irrespective of the addition of exogenous  transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Introduction of the TGF-β1 receptor  inhibitor SB431542 abrogated the proximal enhancement. This approach providing  spatiotemporal control over biophysical signals and resulting cell behavior could  aid in better understanding fibrotic disease progression and the development of  therapeutic interventions for chronic wounds. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE:  Hydrogels are used in cell culture to recapitulate both biochemical and  biophysical aspects of the native extracellular matrix. Biophysical cues like  stiffness can impact cell behavior. However, with conventional hydrogels, there  is a limited ability to actively modulate stiffness after polymerization. We have  developed an ultrasound-based method of spatiotemporally-controlling mechanical  and morphological properties within a composite hydrogel, termed an  acoustically-responsive scaffold (ARS). Upon exposure to ultrasound, bubbles are  non-thermally generated within the fibrin matrix of an ARS, thereby locally  compacting and stiffening the matrix. We demonstrate how ARSs control the  differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in 2D. This approach could  assist with the study of fibrosis and the development of therapies for chronic  wounds.","2022-01-15","2024-03-06 17:10:13","2024-03-06T17:10:13Z","","133-143","","","138","","Acta Biomater","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Acta Materialia Inc.

Here we show that the selective activation  of the nerve plexus of the hepatic portal system via peripheral focused  ultrasound stimulation (pFUS) improves glucose homoeostasis in mice and rats with  insulin-resistant diabetes and in swine subject to hyperinsulinemic-euglycaemic  clamps. pFUS modulated the activity of sensory projections to the hypothalamus,  altered the concentrations of metabolism-regulating neurotransmitters, and  enhanced glucose tolerance and utilization in the three species, whereas physical  transection or chemical blocking of the liver-brain nerve pathway abolished the  effect of pFUS on glucose tolerance. Longitudinal multi-omic profiling of  metabolic tissues from the treated animals confirmed pFUS-induced modifications  of key metabolic functions in liver, pancreas, muscle, adipose, kidney and  intestinal tissues.

In this context, we evaluated MRI-based synthetic CT (sCT)  imaging for the visualization of cortical bone. METHODS: MR and CT images of nine  patients with pelvic and femoral metastases were retrospectively analyzed in this  study. The metastatic lesions were osteolytic, osteoblastic or mixed. sCT were  generated from pre-treatment or treatment MR images using a UNet-like neural  network. sCT was qualitatively and quantitatively compared to CT in the bone  (pelvis or femur) containing the metastasis and in a region of interest placed on  the metastasis itself, through mean absolute difference (MAD), mean difference  (MD), Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and root mean square surface distance  (RMSD). RESULTS: The dataset consisted of 3 osteolytic, 4 osteoblastic and 2  mixed metastases. For most patients, the general morphology of the bone was well  represented in the sCT images and osteolytic, osteoblastic and mixed lesions  could be discriminated. Despite an average timespan between MR and CT  acquisitions of 61 days, in bone, the average (± standard deviation) MAD was 116  ± 26 HU, MD - 14 ± 66 HU, DSC 0.85 ± 0.05, and RMSD 2.05 ± 0.48 mm and, in the  lesion, MAD was 132 ± 62 HU, MD - 31 ± 106 HU, DSC 0.75 ± 0.2, and RMSD 2.73 ±  2.28 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Synthetic CT images adequately depicted the cancellous and  cortical bone distribution in the different lesion types, which shows its  potential for MRI-HIFU treatment planning.

The  three-drug regimen costs over $320,000 per treatment course, requires a 4 h  infusion time, and has many adverse side effects, while achieving only 18 months  of progression-free survival. To replace this regimen, reduce infusion time, and  enhance efficacy, a single therapeutic is developed based on  trastuzumab-conjugated nanoparticles for co-delivering docetaxel and siRNA  against HER2 (siHER2). The optimal nanoconstruct has a hydrodynamic size of  100 nm and specifically treats HER2+ breast cancer cells over organ-derived  normal cells. In a drug-resistant orthotopic HER2+ HCC1954 tumor mouse model, the  nanoconstruct inhibits tumor growth more effectively than the docetaxel and  trastuzumab combination. When coupled with microbubble-assisted focused  ultrasound that transiently disrupts the blood brain barrier, the nanoconstruct  inhibits the growth of trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ BT474 tumors residing in the  brains of mice. The nanoconstruct has a favorable safety profile in cells and in  mice. Combination therapies have become the cornerstone of cancer treatment and  this versatile nanoparticle platform can co-deliver multiple therapeutic types to  ensure that they reach the target cells at the same time to realize their  synergy.","2022-03","2024-03-06 17:10:00","2024-03-06T17:10:00Z","","e2107550","","11","18","","Small","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","","","","","","PMID: 35083840  PMCID: PMC8959011","","","","*Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy; *Breast Neoplasms/pathology; *HER2+; *Nanoparticles; *breast cancer; *nanoparticles; *siRNAs; *taxane; Animals; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use; Female; HER2+; Humans; Mice; RNA, Small Interfering; Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics; Taxoids/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Trastuzumab/adverse effects/therapeutic use; breast cancer; nanoparticles; siRNAs; taxane","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are usually performed in combination with other treatment modalities,  including lasers and energy-based devices, to enhance cosmetic results.  Theoretically, HA and other filler injections should be performed after laser- or  energy-based device treatments. In some instances, however, practitioners are  asked to administer laser- or energy-based device treatment after HA dermal  filler injection. There is a concerning possibility of HA filler degradation as a  result of bulk heating generated by lasers or energy-based devices, especially  radiofrequency (RF). AIM: To evaluate the effect of RF treatment at different  time points on HA degradation in vivo, using clinicohistological analysis.  PATIENTS/METHODS: Fourteen volunteers were recruited and received intradermal HA  filler injections in four sites on the abdomen. One site served as the control,  and the other three sites were treated with monopolar RF on the same day after  injection, at 14 and 28 days post-injection. Skin biopsies were performed at  baseline and 56 days after HA injection. Histopathological sections were reviewed  for residual filler in the tissue. RESULTS: The results showed that HA grading  scores decreased in five (35.71%), one (7.14%), and one (7.14%) participants when  RF was performed immediately, 14 and 28 days after injection, respectively.  CONCLUSION: In conclusion, RF treatment after HA filler injection may affect the  integrity of the HA filler in the tissue, especially if RF treatment was  performed on the same day after HA injection.","2023-03","2024-03-06 17:09:54","2024-03-06T17:09:54Z","","798-803","","3","22","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

Resting  state functional connectivity (rs-FC) correlates of MRgFUS have not been  extensively investigated yet. A region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI rs-FC MRI  ""connectomic"" analysis focusing on brain regions relevant for tremor was  conducted on 15 tremor-dominant patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent  MRgFUS. We tested whether rs-FC between tremor-related areas was modulated by  MRgFUS at 1 and 3 months post-operatively, and whether such changes correlated  with individual clinical outcomes assessed by the MDS-UPDRS-III sub items for  tremor. Significant increase in FC was detected within bilateral primary motor  (M1) cortices, as well as between bilateral M1 and crossed primary somatosensory  cortices, and also between pallidum and the dentate nucleus of the untreated  hemisphere. Correlation between disease duration and FC increase at 3 months was  found between the putamen of both cerebral hemispheres and the Lobe VI of both  cerebellar hemispheres, as well as between the Lobe VI of untreated cerebellar  hemisphere with bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA). Drop-points value of  MDS-UPDRS at 3 months correlated with post-treatment decrease in FC, between the  anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral SMA, as well as between the Lobe VI of  treated cerebellar hemisphere and the interpositus nucleus of untreated  cerebellum. Tremor improvement at 3 months, expressed as percentage of  intra-subject MDS-UPDRS changes, correlated with FC decrease between bilateral  occipital fusiform gyrus and crossed Lobe VI and Vermis VI. Good responders (≥50%  of baseline tremor improvement) showed reduced FC between bilateral SMA, between  the interpositus nucleus of untreated cerebellum and the Lobe VI of treated  cerebellum, as well as between the untreated SMA and the contralateral putamen.  Good responders were characterized at baseline by crossed hypoconnectivity  between bilateral putamen and M1, as well as between the putamen of the treated  hemisphere and the contralateral SMA. We conclude that MRgFUS can effectively  modulate brain FC within the tremor network. Such changes are associated with  clinical outcome. The shifting mode of integration among the constituents of this  network is, therefore, susceptible to external redirection despite the chronic  nature of PD.","2021","2024-03-06 17:00:31","2024-03-06T17:00:31Z","","786734","","","12","","Front Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Stanziano, Golfrè Andreasi, Messina, Rinaldo, Palermo, Verri, Demichelis, Medina, Ghielmetti, Bonvegna, Nigri, Frazzetta, D'Incerti, Tringali,  DiMeco, Eleopra and Bruzzone.","","","","","","PMID: 35095731  PMCID: PMC8791196","","","","MRgFUS (magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery); Parkinson's disease; fMRI; resting state functional connectivity; tremor; ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pallidotomy is performed off-center  within the cranium compared to thalamotomy and may present challenges to  therapeutic lesioning due to this location. However, the impact of target  location on treatment efficiency and ability to create therapeutic lesions has  not been studied. This study aimed to compare the physical efficiency of MRgFUS  thalamotomy and pallidotomy. METHODS: Treatment characteristics were compared  between patients treated with thalamotomy (n = 20) or pallidotomy (n = 20),  matched by skull density ratios (SDR). Aspects of treatment efficiency were  compared between these groups. Demographic and comparative statistics were  conducted to assess these differences. Acoustic field simulations were performed  to compare and validate the simulated temperature profile for VIM and GPi  ablation. RESULTS: Lower SDR values were associated with greater energy  requirement for thalamotomy (R(2) = 0.197, p = 0.049) and pallidotomy (R(2) =  0.342, p = 0.007). The impact of low SDR on efficiency reduction was greater for  pallidotomy, approaching significance (p = 0.061). A nearly two-fold increase in  energy was needed to reach 50°C in pallidotomy (10.9kJ) than in thalamotomy  (5.7kJ), (p = 0.002). Despite lower energy requirement, the maximum average  temperature reached was higher in thalamotomy (56.7°C) than in pallidotomy  (55.0°C), (p = 0.017). Mean incident angle of acoustic beams was lesser in  thalamotomy (12.7°) than in pallidotomy (18.6°), (p < 0.001). For all patients, a  lesser mean incident angle correlated with a higher maximum average temperature  reached (R(2) = 0.124, p = 0.026), and less energy needed to reach 50°C  (R(2)=0.134, p = 0.020). Greater skull thickness was associated with a higher  maximum energy for a single sonication for thalamotomy (R(2) = 0.206, p = 0.045)  and pallidotomy (R(2) = 0.403, p = 0.003). An acoustic and temperature field  simulation validated similar findings for thalamotomy and pallidotomy in a single  patient. CONCLUSION: The centrally located VIM offers a more efficient location  for therapeutic lesioning compared to GPi pallidotomy in SDR matched cohort of  patients. The impact on therapeutic lesioning with lower SDR may be greater for  pallidotomy patients. As newer off-center targets are investigated, these  findings can inform patient selection and treatment requirements for lesion  production.","2021","2024-03-06 17:00:03","2024-03-06T17:00:03Z","","808810","","","12","","Front Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Ahmed, Guo, Kelm, Clanton, Melhem, Gullapalli, Ksendzovsky, Eisenberg, Miller and Gandhi.","","","","","","PMID: 35126300  PMCID: PMC8813961","","","","focused ultrasound (MRgFUS); movement disorders; skull density ratio; stereotactic ablation; thalamotomy pallidotomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MR-guided Focused  Ultrasound (MRgFUS) subthalamotomy is being explored as a therapeutic alternative  to Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the STN. The hyperdirect pathway provides a  direct connection between the cortex and the STN and is likely to play a key role  in the therapeutic effects of MRgFUS intervention in PD patients. OBJECTIVE: This  study aims to investigate the topography and somatotopy of hyperdirect pathway  projections from the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: We used advanced  multi-fiber tractography and high-resolution diffusion MRI data acquired on five  subjects of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to reconstruct hyperdirect pathway  projections from M1. Two neuroanatomy experts reviewed the anatomical accuracy of  the tracts. We extracted the fascicles arising from the trunk, arm, hand, face  and tongue area from the reconstructed pathways. We assessed the variability  among subjects based on the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)  of the fibers. We evaluated the spatial arrangement of the different fascicles  using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of spatial overlap and the centroids  of the bundles. RESULTS: We successfully reconstructed hyperdirect pathway  projections from M1 in all five subjects. The tracts were in agreement with the  expected anatomy. We identified hyperdirect pathway fascicles projecting from the  trunk, arm, hand, face and tongue area in all subjects. Tract-derived  measurements showed low variability among subjects, and similar distributions of  FA and MD values among the fascicles projecting from different M1 areas. We found  an anterolateral somatotopic arrangement of the fascicles in the corona radiata,  and an average overlap of 0.63 in the internal capsule and 0.65 in the zona  incerta. CONCLUSION: Multi-fiber tractography combined with high-resolution  diffusion MRI data enables the identification of the somatotopic organization of  the hyperdirect pathway. Our preliminary results suggest that the subdivisions of  the hyperdirect pathway projecting from the trunk, arm, hand, face, and tongue  motor area are intermixed at the level of the zona incerta and posterior limb of  the internal capsule, with a predominantly overlapping topographical organization  in both regions. Subject-specific knowledge of the hyperdirect pathway somatotopy  could help optimize target definition in MRgFUS intervention.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","791092","","","13","","Front Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Pujol, Cabeen, Yelnik, François, Fernandez Vidal, Karachi, Bardinet, Cosgrove and Kikinis.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35547388  PMCID: PMC9081715","","","","diffusion MRI; neuroanatomy; somatotopy; stereotactic surgery; tractography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has proven useful in several clinical applications,  with promising outcomes reported in the recent literature. Furthermore, it is  currently being investigated in a range of neuromodulation (NM) and ablative  applications, including epilepsy. In this application, tFUS access through the  temporal window is the key to optimizing the treatment safety and efficacy.  Traditional approaches have utilized transducers with low operating frequencies  for tFUS applications. Modern array transducers and driving systems allow for  more intelligent use of the temporal window by exploiting the spatio-spectral  transmission bandwidth to a specified target or targets within the brain. To  demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we have investigated the ultrasound  reflection and transmission characteristics for different access points within  the temporal window of human skull samples ex vivo. Different transmit-receive  (Rx) configurations are used for characterization of the spatio-spectral  variability in reflection and transmission through the temporal window. In this  article, we show results from a dual-piston transducer set up in the frequency  range of 2-7 MHz. Broadband pulses as well as synthesized orthogonal frequency  division multiplexed (OFDM) waveforms were used. The latter was used to improve  the magnitude and phase measurements in 100-kHz subbands within the 2-7 MHz  spectral window. A temperature-controlled water bath was used to characterize the  change in reflection and transmission characteristics with temperature in the  25°C-43°C range. The measured values of the complex reflection and transmission  coefficients exhibited significant variations with space, frequency, and  temperature. On the other hand, the measured transmission phase varied more with  location and frequency, with smaller sensitivity to temperature. A  measurement-based hybrid angular spectrum (HAS) simulation through the human  temporal bone was used to demonstrate the dependence of focusing gain on the  skull profile and spatial distribution of change of speed of sound (SOS) at  different skull temperatures.","2022-05","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1727-1737","","5","69","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35349438  PMCID: PMC9050954","","","","*Skull/diagnostic imaging; *Transducers; Brain; Humans; Temperature; Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients can undergo further and potentially curative  treatment including salvage surgery, brachytherapy (BT), external beam  radiotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound and cryotherapy. Systematic  review shows that high-dose-rate (HDR) BT and stereotactic body radiotherapy  (SBRT) have the best outcomes in terms of biochemical control and lowest side  effects. The reirradiation options for previously irradiated prostate cancer  (RO-PIP) trial aims to determine the feasibility of recruitment to a trial  randomising patients to salvage HDR-BT or SBRT and provide prospective data on  patient recorded toxicity outcomes that will inform a future phase III trial.  METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint of the RO-PIP feasibility study is to  evaluate the patient recruitment potential over 2 years to a trial randomising to  either SBRT or HDR-BT for patients who develop local recurrence of prostate  cancer following previous radiation therapy. The aim is to recruit 60 patients  across 3 sites over 2 years and randomise 1:1 to SBRT or HDR-BT. Secondary  objectives include recording clinician and patient-reported outcome measures to  evaluate treatment-related toxicity. In addition, the study aims to identify  potential imaging, genomic and proteomic biomarkers that are predictive of  toxicity and outcome based on hypoxia status, a prognostic marker of prostate  cancer.

To  reduce exposure during the Coronavirus Infectious Disease-2019 (COVID-19)  pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) broadened access to  telehealth services. We assessed provider satisfaction with the rapid transition  from in-person prenatal visits to multidisciplinary consultations via telehealth  as an adaptive response to the pandemic. METHODS: Patients referred to an urban  academic fetal care center during the first 6 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic  underwent advanced imaging including fetal MRI, focused ultrasound, and fetal  echocardiography. Subsequently, multidisciplinary telehealth consultations  occurred with all providers attending virtually. Patients were given the option  of attending the multidisciplinary telehealth consultation in a conference room  in the hospital or from home. During these meetings, relevant images were  reviewed with all participants via screen sharing through a secure video  platform. Provider satisfaction with the telehealth paradigm was assessed using  an electronic survey. RESULTS: Twenty-two surveys were administered with a  response rate of 82%. 89% of providers were highly satisfied with the telehealth  format. 72% of providers would prefer the multidisciplinary telehealth format to  an in-person visit for future visits after COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. 22%  of providers would leave the choice to the patient's family. One provider  preferred in-person visits. Some providers noted that virtual conferences limited  the ability to draw pictures, show educational materials, and provide emotional  support. CONCLUSION: Providers were overwhelmingly supportive of continuing  multidisciplinary telehealth conferences for complex prenatal consultations, even  after restrictions are lifted, which has led to the continuation of this model  for the duration of the pandemic. Providers highlighted the convenience and  improved care coordination across specialties. Further studies to examine the  patient experience with virtual consultations are warranted.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","9765-9769","","25","35","","J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35337237","","","","*COVID-19; *Communicable Diseases; *Telemedicine/methods; Aged; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Medicare; Pandemics; Patient Satisfaction; Personal Satisfaction; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care/methods; Referral and Consultation; Telehealth; United States; multidisciplinary; provider satisfaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultrasound signals backscattered from bone contain information associated with microstructures. This study  proposed using entropy imaging to collect the information in bone microstructures  as a possible solution for ultrasound bone tissue characterization. Bone phantoms  with different pounds per cubic foot (PCF) were used for ultrasound scanning by  using single-element transducers of 1 (nonfocused) and 3.5 MHz (nonfocused and  focused). Clinical measurements were also performed on lumbar vertebrae (L3  spinal segment) in participants with different ages (n = 34) and postmenopausal  women with low or moderate-to-high risk of osteoporosis (n = 50; identified using  the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Taiwan). The signals backscattered from  the bone phantoms and subjects were acquired for ultrasound entropy imaging by  using sliding window processing. The independent t-test, one-way analysis of  variance, Spearman correlation coefficient r(s), and the receiver operating  characteristic (ROC) curve were used for statistical analysis. The results  indicated that ultrasound entropy imaging revealed changes in bone  microstructures. Using the 3.5-MHz focused ultrasound, small-window entropy  imaging (side length: one pulse length of the transducer) was found to have high  performance and sensitivity in detecting variation among the PCFs (r(s) = - 0.83;  p < 0.05). Small-window entropy imaging also performed well in discriminating  young and old participants (p < 0.05) and postmenopausal women with low versus  moderate-to-high osteoporosis risk (the area under the ROC curve = 0.80; cut-off  value = 2.65; accuracy = 86.00%; sensitivity = 71.43%; specificity = 88.37%).

Focused ultrasound (FUS) has been applied  for transient blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening of cortical regions in  neurodegenerative disorders. The striatum is a primary target for delivery of  putative therapeutic agents in PD. OBJECTIVE: Here, we report a prospective,  single-arm, nonrandomized, proof-of-concept, phase I clinical trial (NCT03608553  amended) in PD with dementia to test the safety and feasibility of striatal BBB  opening in PD patients. METHODS: Seven PD patients with cognitive impairment were  treated for BBB opening in the posterior putamen. This was performed in two  sessions separated by 2 to 4 weeks, where the second session included bilateral  putamina opening in 3 patients. Primary outcome measures included safety and  feasibility of focal striatal BBB opening. Changes in motor and cognitive  functions, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (18) F-fluorodopa (FDOPA), and  β-amyloid PET (positron emission tomography) images were determined. RESULTS: The  procedure was feasible and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. No  neurologically relevant change in motor and cognitive (battery of  neuropsychological tests) functions was recognized at follow-up. MRI revealed  putamen BBB closing shortly after treatment (24 hours to 14 days) and ruled out  hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions. There was a discrete but significant reduction  in β-amyloid uptake in the targeted region and no change in FDOPA PET.

In this paper, we discuss old  and new surgical treatments for PD and the many technological innovations in this  field. We have initially reviewed the relevant surgical anatomy as well as the  pathological signaling considered to be the underlying cause of specific symptoms  of PD. Subsequently, early attempts at surgical symptom control will be briefly  reviewed. As the most well-known surgical intervention for PD is deep brain  stimulation, this subject is discussed at length. As deciding on whether a  patient stands to benefit from DBS can be quite difficult, the different proposed  paradigms for precisely this are covered. Following this, the evidence regarding  different targets, especially the subthalamic nucleus and internal globus  pallidus, is reviewed as well as the evidence for newer proposed targets for  specific symptoms. Due to the rapidly expanding nature of knowledge and  technological capabilities, some of these new and potential future capabilities  are given consideration in terms of their current and future use. Following this,  we have reviewed newer treatment modalities, especially magnetic resonance-guided  focused ultrasound and other potential surgical therapies, such as spinal cord  stimulation for gait symptoms and others.

They are extremely difficult to diagnose, monitor and treat. Conventional  anti-cancer strategies such as radio- and chemotherapy have largely failed, and  to date, the development of even a single effective therapeutic strategy against  central nervous system (CNS) tumors has remained elusive. There are several  factors responsible for this. Brain cancers are a heterogeneous group of diseases  with variable origins, biochemical properties and degrees of invasiveness.  High-grade gliomas are amongst the most metastatic and invasive cancers, which is  another reason for therapeutic failure in their case. Moreover, crossing the  blood brain and the blood brain tumor barriers has been a significant hindrance  in the development of efficient CNS therapeutics. Cancer nanomedicine, which  encompasses the application of nanotechnology for diagnosis, monitoring and  therapy of cancers, is a rapidly evolving field of translational medicine.  Nanoformulations, because of their extreme versatility and manipulative  potential, are emerging candidates for tumor targeting, penetration and treatment  in the brain. Moreover, suitable nanocarriers can be commissioned for  theranostics, a combinatorial personalized approach for simultaneous imaging and  therapy. This review first details the recent advances in novel bioengineering  techniques that provide promising avenues for circumventing the hurdles of  delivering the diagnostic/therapeutic agent to the CNS. The authors then describe  in detail the tremendous potential of utilizing nanotechnology, particularly  nano-theranostics for brain cancer imaging and therapy, and outline the different  categories of recently developed next-generation smart nanoformulations that have  exceptional potential for making a breakthrough in clinical neuro-oncology  therapeutics.","2022-11-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","21","14","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36358807  PMCID: PMC9655255","","","","bioengineering; electro-magnetic nanoparticles; exosomes; focused ultrasound; gliomas; theranostics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our previous study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of sonodynamic  therapy (SDT) on atherosclerotic plaques. However, traditional single-element  therapeutic transducer has single acoustic field, and positioning therapeutic and  imaging transducers in the same position is difficult during ultrasound  imaging-guided SDT. Continuously changing the position of transducers to  intervene lesions in different positions is required, increasing the difficulty  of treatment. Thus, an SDT device with precise theranostics is required.  Therefore, we designed and fabricated a ""concentric ultrasound transducer for  theranostics"" (CUST-T), comprising a central 8-MHz linear array transducer for  ultrasound imaging, and a peripheral 1-MHz hollow two-dimensional (2-D) planar  array transducer for generating phased-array focused ultrasound (PAFUS). The  CUST-T exhibited high imaging resolution at a distance of up to 20 mm from the  transducer and could generate a personalized complex PAFUS acoustic field to  match various lesions. In vitro biomedical results showed that PAFUS-SDT induced  RAW264.7-derived foam cell apoptosis leading to a targeting field apoptotic rate  4.36-6.24 times that of the nontargeting field and the significant apoptotic  region was consistent with the PAFUS acoustic field.

Conventional focusing techniques  based on curved surfaces, metamaterial structures, and multielement phased arrays  either present difficulties in massively parallel manufacturing with high  precision or require complex drive electronics to operate. These difficulties  have been addressed by microfabricated self-focusing acoustic transducers (SFATs)  with Parylene air-cavity Fresnel acoustic lenses (ACFALs), which require a  time-demanding step in removing the sacrificial layer. This paper presents three  new and improved types of ACFALs based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), an  SU-8/PDMS bilayer, and SU-8, which are manufactured through simple  sacrificial-layer-free microfabrication processes that are two to four times  faster than that for the Parylene ACFALs. Moreover, by studying the effect of the  lens thickness on the acoustic transmittance through the lens, the performance of  the transducers has been optimized with improved thickness control techniques  developed for PDMS and SU-8. As a result, the measured power transfer efficiency  (PTE) and peak output acoustic pressure are up to 2.0 and 1.8 times higher than  those of the Parylene ACFALs, respectively. The simple microfabrication  techniques described in this paper are useful for manufacturing not only  high-performance ACFALs but also other miniaturized devices with hollow or  suspended structures for microfluidic and optical applications.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","75","","","8","","Microsyst Nanoeng","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2022.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35812805  PMCID: PMC9256634","","","","Electrical and electronic engineering; Electronic devices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their application against gliomas has not been studied.  Herein, multifunctional cancer homologous targeting biomimetic nanoparticles  (PIOC@CM NPs) encapsulating both Fe(3)O(4) and Ce6 were constructed as a  nanosonosensitizer. Based on focused ultrasound (US) combined with circulating  microbubbles (MBs) to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a safe and transient  manner, the development of a therapeutic strategy to integrate the biomimetic  nanosonosensitizer-mediated SDT and ferroptosis could achieve synergistic  therapeutic effects against gliomas. We demonstrated that the glioma C6 cell  membrane (CM) on the surface of the NPs allowed the nanosonosensitizer to  accumulate selectively in tumors through homologous targeting in vitro. After  efficient internalization in C6 cells, the PIOC@CM NPs could significantly  increase the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and deplete glutathione (GSH)  upon ultrasonic irradiation, resulting in the loss of glutathione peroxidase-4  (GPX4) activity, which facilitated SDT and ferroptosis to kill glioma C6 cells.  Furthermore, the PIOC@CM NPs were intravenously injected after noninvasively  opening the BBB via US-MBs, which enhanced the accumulation of the  nanosonosensitizer in tumor tissues. Crucially, an attractive phenomenon of the  significant reduction in orthotopic gliomas after the second US pulse-triggered  SDT and ferroptosis was observed. Taken together, this study presents a novel  combinatorial glioma therapeutic strategy based on noninvasive BBB opening with a  biomimetic sonotheranostic system-mediated SDT and ferroptosis.","2022-07-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","3911-3923","","14","10","","Biomater Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35699471","","","","*Ferroptosis; *Glioma/drug therapy/pathology; *Nanoparticles/metabolism; *Ultrasonic Therapy/methods; Biomimetics; Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the last 20 years, there is a progressive interest in  use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in mental illnesses.

Despite the fact that the efficacy of neuromodulation with DBS, as well  as of various lesional interventions, in cases of mental illnesses is still not  fully established, there are several premises for wider applications of such  ""unclassical"" psychiatric treatments in the future. Novel technologies of DBS,  developments in non-invasive lesioning using stereotactic radiosurgery and  transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound, and advances of  neurophysiological and neuroimaging modalities may bolster further clinical  applications of psychiatric neurosurgery, improve its results, and allow for  individually selected treatment strategies tailored to specific needs of the  patient.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","61-96","","1","270","","Prog Brain Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

This strategy was applied to the  valorisation of pomegranate seeds. Nine different NADES were screened and that  constituted by choline chloride and acetic acid was chosen due to its best  performance. A Response Surface Methodology was employed to optimize other  conditions in this extraction step: time, temperature, amount of sample, and HIFU  amplitude. Protein recovery, under optimal conditions, was 13.3 g of  proteins/100 g of milled and dried defatted seeds. Proteins were next  characterized by their separation using RP-HPLC, SDS-PAGE, isoelectrofocusing  electrophoresis, and by the evaluation of their digestibility and antioxidant  properties. Comparison of these results with those from extracts obtained by  other techniques supported the interest of combining the extraction using acid  NADES with PLE, under alkaline conditions. The successive extraction by both  methodologies enabled to double the total recovery of proteins. The analysis of  samples by UHPLC-MS/MS, after a simulated gastrointestinal digestion, and de novo  identification revealed the presence of 19 peptides in the NADES hydrolysate,  while the successive extraction by PLE enabled to observe 15 additional peptides.  Additional 83 peptides were found by database searching against Punica granatum  and by homology with other organisms. Differences between peptides and the  proteins in both hydrolysates confirmed the different protein selectivity of both  strategies and the potential of NADES for extracting larger proteins and PLE for  the extraction of smaller ones. Some phenolic compounds, amino acids, and fatty  acids were also co-extracted with proteins in both extractions.","2022-11","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","111862","","","161","","Food Res Int","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Essential Tremor (ET) is the most  common movement disorder affecting approximately 1 million in the UK causing  considerable societal impact affecting patients, carers and the wider  healthservice. Medical treatment has mixed efficacy, with approximately 25-55% of  ET medication refractory. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a proven neurosurgical  treatment; however, the risks of surgery and anaesthesia mean some patients are  ineligible. MRgFUS is an emerging noninvasive technique that causes tremor  suppression by thermal ablation of tremor-sensitive brain tissue. Several  international clinical trials have demonstrated MRgFUS is safe and clinically  effective; however, to-date no cost-effectiveness study has been performed in  Europe. METHODS: A Markov model was used to assess two subpopulations of mrET -  those eligible and those ineligible for neurosurgery - in the context specific to  England and its healthcare system. For those eligible for neurosurgery, MRgFUS  was compared to DBS, the current standard treatment. For those ineligible for  neurosurgery, MRgFUS was compared to treatment with medication alone. The model  calculated the Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with appropriate  sensitivity and scenario analyses. RESULTS: For those eligible for neurosurgery:  In the model base case, the MRgFUS was economically dominant compared to DBS;  MRgFUS was less costly (£19,779 vs £62,348) and more effective generating 0.03  additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient (3.71 vs 3.68) over  the 5-year time horizon.For those ineligible for neurosurgery: In the model base  case, MRgFUS cost over £16,000 per patient more than medication alone (£19,779 vs  £62,348) but yielded 0.77 additional QALYs per patient(3.71 vs 2.95), producing  an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £20,851 per QALY. This ICER of  £20,851 per QALY falls within the National Institute for Clinical Excellence's  (NICE) willingness to pay threshold (WTP) of 20,000-30,000 demonstrating the  cost-effectiveness profile of MRgFUS. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the  favourable cost-effectiveness profile of MRgFUS for the treatment of mrET in  England; in both patients suitable and not suitable for neurosurgery. ADVANCES IN  KNOWLEDGE: The introduction of MRgFUS as a widely available ET treatment in UK is  currently undergoing the necessary stages of regulatory approval. As the first  European study, these favourable cost-effectiveness outcomes (notably the model  base case ICER falling within NICE's WTP) can provide a basis for future  commissioning of brain MRgFUS treatments in the UK, Europe and globally.","2022-12-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","20220137","","1140","95","","Br J Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36125247  PMCID: PMC9733625","","","","*Deep Brain Stimulation/methods; *Essential Tremor/therapy/surgery; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Treatment Outcome; Tremor/therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transcranial LIFU  requires a low-frequency ultrasound of around 0.5 MHz due to skull attenuation,  thus providing poor axial and lateral resolution. This paper proposes a new  conceptual device that would use a stent to place a high-frequency ultrasound  array within the brain vasculature to achieve high axial and lateral spatial  resolution. The first part of this work identified the most commonly treated deep  brain nuclei and examined the human brain vasculature for stent placement.

Between 30 % and 60 % of GBM are characterized by overexpression of  the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). The anti-EGFR antibody Cetuximab  (CTX) showed a favorable effect for EGFR(+) colorectal cancer but failed to  demonstrate efficacy for GBM. Insufficient CTX passage through the blood-brain  barrier (BBB) and the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) is assumed to be the primary  determinant of the limited efficacy of this immunotherapy. OBJECTIVE: Using  positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we have previously demonstrated that  focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles (µB) allowed significant and  persistent delivery of CTX across the BBB in healthy mice. In the current study,  we investigated by PET imaging the combination impact of CTX and FUS on  orthotopic GBM preclinical model. METHODS: After radiolabeling CTX with the long  half-life isotope (89)Zr, PET images have been acquired overtime in mice bearing  U251 (EGFR(+)) with or without FUS treatment. Autoradiography combined with  immunofluorescence staining was used to corroborate CTX delivery with EGFR  expression. A survival study was conducted simultaneously to evaluate the  therapeutic benefit of repeated CTX monotherapy associated or not with FUS.  RESULTS: Ex vivo analysis confirmed that FUS enhanced and homogenized the  delivery of CTX into all the FUS exposure area, including the tumor and the  contralateral hemisphere at the early-time-point. Interestingly, FUS did not  improve the long-term accumulation and retention of CTX in the tumor compared  with the control group (no FUS). No significant difference in the CTX treatment  efficacy, determined by the survival between FUS and non-FUS groups, has been  either observed. This result is consistent with the absence of change in the CTX  distribution through the GBM tumor after FUS. The neuroinflammation induced by  FUS is not significant enough to explain the failure of the CTX delivery  improvement. CONCLUSION: All together, these data suggest that the role of FUS  combined with µB on the CTX distribution, even after multiple therapeutic  sessions and glial cell activation is insufficient to improve survival of GBM  mice compared with CTX treatment alone in this model.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","141-151","","","182","","Eur J Pharm Biopharm","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Replacement of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase)  slows neurodegeneration in PD models and may be a promising disease-modifying  therapy in patients with PD. However, recombinant GCase has limited penetration  through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Microbubble-mediated magnetic  resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) can reversibly disrupt the BBB for  drug delivery. METHODS: This open-label phase I study investigated the safety and  feasibility of MRgFUS putaminal delivery of intravenous GCase at escalating doses  (15 to 30 to 60 IU/kg) every 2 weeks in four patients with PD with GBA1  mutations. RESULTS: BBB permeability was achieved and restored in all patients as  quantified by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging after  treatment. There were no serious adverse events. Two patients developed transient  dyskinesia after treatment.

Propranolol and primidone are the first-line pharmacological therapies. They provide symptomatic  control in less than 50% of patients. Topiramate, alprazolam, clonazepam,  gabapentin, and botulinum toxin injections are the next line of treatments. These  medications lead to modest improvements and are therefore commonly used as add-on  agents. Surgical therapies, including deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery and  focused ultrasound beam targeted to the thalamus, are considered for treating  tremor refractory to medications and lead to greater than 75% improvements in  tremor symptoms. However, DBS is a costly and an invasive procedure; some  patients report tolerance to benefits. Focused ultrasound therapy leading to  brain lesions is associated with a possibility for permanent clinical deficits.  Therefore, research efforts to develop the next generation of oral medications  with greater benefits and lesser adverse effects are warranted. There is  considerable evidence that the increased functions of calcium channels (P/Q-type  and T-type channels) and reduced functions of calcium-activated potassium  channels (SK channels) located in the neuronal membranes lead to tremor  oscillations. Consequently, many new pharmacological studies have targeted these  channels to leverage better clinical outcomes. The current review will discuss  the pathophysiology, the specific importance of these channels, and the early  clinical experience of using compounds targeting these channels to treat  essential tremor.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","335-355","","","163","","Int Rev Neurobiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: This retrospective study  was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital. From April 2018  to November 2019, a total of 44 symptomatic fibroids in 38 patients who underwent  MRgFUS ablation were included. The association between pre-ablation  characteristics on CEUS/MR imaging and the non-perfusion volume (NPV) after  ablation was analyzed using multivariable linear regression analysis. The area  under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve values  was compared between the CEUS and MR imaging regression models. NPV after  ablation was compared between CEUS and enhanced MR imaging. RESULTS: On CEUS,  entangled branch vessels, fast-in, and fast-out patterns were significantly  associated with NPV, with an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI; 0.88, 1.00). On MR imaging,  hyper-intensity on T2-weighted images (T2WI), hyper-intense ring-like signal on  T2WI images, and hyper-enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1WI images were  correlated with NPV, with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI; 0.70, 1.00). After ablation, no  differences in NPV were noted between contrast-enhanced T1WI (84.13 ± 75.42  cm(3)) and CEUS (80.22 ± 76.49 cm(3)). CONCLUSIONS: Some pre-ablation  characteristics of uterine fibroids on CEUS were associated with NPV after  MRgFUS. CEUS may contribute to the evaluation of ablative outcomes and patient  selection, similar to MR imaging. KEY POINTS: • Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography  (CEUS) is effective for selecting the appropriate uterine fibroids before  MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation and evaluating non-perfusion  volumes (NPV) after ablation, as a potential alternative to MR imaging. • Before  ablation, entangled branch vessels, fast-in, and fast-out patterns on CEUS were  significantly associated with NPV after MRgFUS. • No significant differences in  NPV were detected between contrast-enhanced T1WI and CEUS after ablation.","2022-03","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2110-2119","","3","32","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021. “The Author(s) under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology.","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 34751794","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; *Leiomyoma/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Uterine Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography; Female; Focused ultrasound; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic resonance imaging; Patient selection; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography; Uterine fibroid; Uterus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a nonlinear method,  multi-scale permutation entropy (MPE) is widely used in the recognition of  denatured biological tissue. However, the traditional MPE method neglects the  amplitude information when calculating the time series complexity. The  disadvantage will affect the recognition effect of denatured tissues. In order to  solve the above problems, the method of multi-scale rescaled range permutation  entropy (MRRPE) is proposed in this paper. The simulation results show that the  MRRPE not only includes the amplitude information of the signal when calculating  the signal complexity, but also extracts the extreme volatility characteristics  of the signal effectively. The proposed method is applied to the HIFU echo  signals during HIFU treatment, and the support vector machine (SVM) is used for  recognition. The results show that compared with MPE and the multi-scale weighted  permutation entropy (MWPE), the recognition rate of denatured biological tissue  based on the MRRPE is higher, up to 96.57%, which can better recognize the  non-denatured biological tissues and the denatured biological tissues.","2022-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","102-114","","1","19","","Math Biosci Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 34902982","","","","*Algorithms; *Support Vector Machine; Computer Simulation; Entropy; HIFU; biological tissue; denatured recognition; multi-scale rescaled range permutation entropy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although salvage radical prostatectomy (sRP) is a  well-described salvage option in cases of PGA failure, the evidence supporting  salvage PGA (sPGA) is limited. We hereby report the oncologic and functional  outcomes of patients treated with sPGA following initial treatment with primary  PGA (pPGA). METHODS: We describe the findings of a retrospective review of  patients who had a CaP recurrence after pPGA and then underwent sPGA, at 3  medical centers in Ontario, Canada, between 2005 and 2017. Oncological outcomes  following sPGA were assessed for biochemical recurrence (BCR) and biopsy-proven  recurrence (BPR). Functional outcomes were described using the international  prostate symptom score (IPSS), international index of erectile function (IIEF),  and rates of urinary incontinence (use of >1 pad/day). RESULTS: We identified 25  patients who underwent sPGA following pPGA (hemiablation in 48% and zonal  ablation in 52% of the patients). The median length of time was 16.8 months  (interquartile range [IQR] 14.0-19.1) from pPGA to sPGA and 47.06 months (IQR  19.9-171.3) from pPGA to date of last follow up. High intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU) was the only modality used in all patients. At baseline, the  median age was 65 years (IQR 52-77) and median prostate specific antigen (PSA)  level was 7.46 ng/mL (IQR 1-25). The median time from pPGA to BPR was 12.7 months  (IQR 5.19-36). At BPR following pPGA, 4 patients (17%) had CaP grade group (GG)  1, 10 patients (42%) had GG2, 6 patients (25%) had GG3, and 4 patients (17%) had  GG4 disease, with a median PSA of 3.58 ng/mL (IQR 0.67-19). The median length of  follow up after sPGA was 27.3 months (IQR 14.5-86.3). Following sPGA, 13/25  patients (52%) had BCR with median time to recurrence of 14 months (IQR  2.5-82.15), with a recurrence-free survival of 24.5 months (95% confidence  interval: 15.3-not reached). Of those 13 patients, 4 were managed with sRP, 4  were managed with salvage radiotherapy, 3 were managed with androgen-deprivation  therapy, 1 had a third PGA with HIFU, and 1 was managed with active surveillance.  The mean change from baseline to last follow up in IPSS and IIEF scores was +1.3  (P = 0.66) and -2.3 (P = 0.32), respectively. Urinary incontinence was reported  by 9% of patients at baseline, with only one additional patient developing  incontinence following sPGA. CONCLUSION: Our present study demonstrates that  after a median follow-up of 27 months, sPGA for recurrent CaP following pPGA  provides disease control in up to 50% of patients with nonsignificant detrimental  effects on functional outcomes. Appropriate patient selection and adequate  staging are important to consider before offering PGA to patients.","2022-07","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","343.e1-343.e6","","7","40","","Urol Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

A nadir prostate-specific antigen (nPSA) value 0.02 ng/mL was  observed to predict the b-PFS in multivariate analysis. The 5-year b-PFS was  81.6% for those with nPSA < 0.02 compared with 25.0% with nPSA ≧ 0.02. The  adverse effects related to SRT+ADT were mild in most cases and only three (8%)  patients experienced grade 3 urinary toxicities. For high-risk prostate cancer  after HIFU as primary treatment with biochemical failure, our study confirms the  feasibility of SRT+ADT with high b-PFS, OS and low toxicity.","2022-07-30","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","15","11","","J Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 35956069  PMCID: PMC9369757","","","","androgen antagonist; high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation; prostatic neoplasms; radiotherapy; treatment failure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-three women who  underwent HIFU treatment were divided into groups A (n=47) and B (n=26),  comprising patients with an NPV ratio of at least 90% and <90%, respectively. An  ensemble feature ranking model was introduced based on the score values assigned  to the features by five different ML classifiers to determine the most  informative mpMRI features. The relationship between the mpMRI features and the  immediate NPV ratio of 90% was evaluated using Pearson's correlation  coefficients. The diagnostic ability of the ML classifiers was evaluated using  standard performance metrics, including the area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in eight folds  cross-validation. RESULTS: For all the 12 most informative features, the area  under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, specificity, and  sensitivity ranged from 0.5 to 0.97, 0.34 to 0.97, 0.56 to 1.0, and 0.87 to 1.0,  respectively. The gradient boosting (GBM) classifier demonstrated the best  predictive performance with an AUROC of 0.95 and accuracy of 0.92, followed by  the random forest, AdaBoost, logistic regression, and support vector classifiers,  which yielded an AUROC of 0.92, 0.92, 0.83, and 0.78 and accuracy of 0.96, 0.88,  0.84, and 0.84, respectively.

This is especially true in the  pre-focal zone where the high concentration of bubbles acts as an acoustic  reflector and quenches cavitation above this area. Previous studies attributed  the enhancement of cavitation activity under negative sweep to the activation of  more bubble nuclei, requiring deeper investigations. After mapping this activity  with SCL measurements, cavitation noise spectra were recorded. The behavior of  the acoustic broadband noise follows the sonochemical one i.e., showing the same  attenuation (positive scan) or intensification (negative scan) of cavitational  activity. In 1 M NaCl 3.7 mM 2-propanol solution saturated by a mixture of  Ar-15.5%O(2)-2.2%N(2), intensities of SL spectra are high enough to allow  detection of several molecular emissions (OH, NH, C(2), Na) under negative  frequency sweeps. This is the first report of molecular emissions at such high  frequency. Their intensities are low, and they are very broad, following the  trend obtained at fixed frequency up to 1 MHz. Under optimized conditions, CN  emission chosen as a spectroscopic probe is strong enough to be simulated, which  is reported for the first time at such high frequency. The resulting  characteristics of the plasma do not show any spectral difference, so bubble  nature is the same in the pre-and post-focal zone under different sweeping  parameters. Consequently, SL and SCL intensification was not related to a change  in plasma nature inside the bubbles but to the number of cavitation bubbles.","2022-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","105939","","","83","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

In this study, we propose a thin acrylic film as the  cheapest and most easily accessible phantom for assessing the functionality of  MRgFUS hardware and software. METHODS: Through the paper, specific QA tests are  detailed in the framework of evaluating an MRgFUS preclinical robotic device  comprising a single element spherically focused transducer with a nominal  frequency of 2.75 MHz. These tests take advantage of the reflection of ultrasonic  waves at a plastic-air interface, which results in almost immediate lesion  formation on the film at a threshold of applied acoustic energy. RESULTS: The  phantom offered qualitative information on the power field distribution of the  FUS transducer and the ability to visualize different FUS protocols. It also  enabled quick and reliable assessment of various navigation algorithms as they  are used in real treatments, and also allowed for the assessment of the accuracy  of robotic motion. CONCLUSION: Therefore, it could serve as a useful tool for  detecting defects in system's performance over its lifetime after establishing a  baseline while concurrently contributing to establish QA and calibration  guidelines for clinical routine controls.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","401-408","","2","26","","J Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

METHODS: MR-acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI) is key to targeting FUS  procedures such as neuromodulation, and works by encoding ultrasound-induced  displacements into the phase of MR images. However, it can require long scan  times to cover a volume of tissue, especially when minimizing the FUS dose during  targeting is paramount. To simultaneously minimize scan time and the FUS duty  cycle, a 2-min three-dimensional (3D) reduced-FOV spin echo ARFI scan with  two-dimensional undersampling was implemented at 3T with a FUS duty cycle of  0.85%. The 3D k-space sampling scheme incorporated uniform undersampling in one  phase-encoded axis and partial Fourier (PF) sampling in the other. The scan  interleaved FUS-on and FUS-off data collection to improve displacement map  quality via a joint low-rank image reconstruction. Experiments in agarose and  graphite phantoms and living macaque brains for neuromodulation and blood-brain  barrier opening studied the effects of the sampling and reconstruction strategy  on the acquisition, and evaluated its repeatability and accuracy. RESULTS: In the  phantom, the distances between displacement centroids of 10 prospective  reconstructions and a fully sampled reference were below 1 mm. In in vivo brain,  the distances between centroids ranged from 1.3 to 2.1 mm. Results in phantom and  in vivo brain both showed that the proposed method can recover the FUS focus  compared to slower fully sampled scans. CONCLUSION: The proposed 3D MR-ARFI  reduced-FOV method enables rapid imaging of the FUS focus while maintaining a low  FUS duty cycle.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2419-2431","","6","88","","Magn Reson Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35916311  PMCID: PMC9529839","","","","*Graphite; 3D; Acoustics; Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods; MR-ARFI; MRI; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Phantoms, Imaging; Prospective Studies; Sepharose; focused-ultrasound; low-rank; reduced-FOV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total  of 406 patients with uterine fibroids who underwent percutaneous ultrasound  ablation were analyzed retrospectively. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans before and after high-intensity focused  ultrasound. The abnormal signal intensity (low signal intensity on T1WI and high  signal intensity on T2WI) on the postoperative MRIs was indicative of a sacral  injury. The patients were divided into a sacrum injury group and a sacrum  non-injury group. The relationship between fibroid characteristics, ultrasound  ablation parameters, and injury was analyzed using univariate and multivariate  analyses. RESULTS: There were 139 cases of sacral injury (34.24%). When the  distance from the fibroid's dorsal side to the sacrum was 0-10 mm, the risk  assessment showed that the danger of sacral injury increased by 1.85 times and  3.03 times compared with that at a distance of 11-20 or 21-30 mm. Furthermore,  the risk of sacral injury increased by 1.89 times and 3.23 times when the  therapeutic dose (TD) of a fibroid was >500 KJ compared with that of a fibroid  with TD= 250-500 KJ and <250 KJ. CONCLUSION: A distance of 10 mm or less and a TD  of >500 KJ were significantly correlated with sacral injury. The distance from  the fibroid's dorsal side to the sacrum and the TD were the main causes of injury  to the sacrum.

It  generates a precise thermal ablation in a specific nucleus or tract, such as  ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) or pallidothalamic tract (PTT). Despite a  single lesion improving parts of the PD symptoms, the feasibility and efficacy of  a stepwise dual-lesion in VIM and PTT are yet to be explored. METHODS: Three  patients with tremor-dominant PD (aged 60.7 ± 6.0 years) received dual-target  MRgFUS treatment with a series of primary and secondary outcome measures. The VIM  and PTT were navigated based on individual magnetic resonance imaging planning of  the brain. The primary outcome measures were the off-status Clinical Rating Scale  for Tremor and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III). The  secondary outcome measures included UPDRS I, II, IV, Hohen and Yahr score,  Neuropsychiatry Inventory, Quality of life in PD Rating Scale, Non-Motor Symptoms  Scale, and Clinical Global Impression. The baseline data were compared with those  acquired 1 day and 1 month following the treatment. RESULTS: The severity of  tremor and motor deficits represented by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor-part B  and UPDRS III were significantly improved (P < 0.05 by nonparametric Mann-Whitney  U tests) after dual-target ablations. The nonmotor symptoms investigated by UPDRS  II and Non-Motor Symptoms Scale also showed significant improvement at the 1-day  and 1-month follow-up.

This study aimed  to investigate the global research status and developmental directions of CSP to  discern promising research hotspots by means of bibliometrics and visualized  analyses. METHODS: The English CSP-related literature from 2001 to 2020 was  retrieved from The Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database. Microsoft  Excel 2019 was used to analyze the years, countries, institutions, journals,  authors, citations, H indices, titles, abstracts, and keywords of related  literature, and VOSviewer software was used to visualize developmental directions  and promising hotspots in CSP. RESULTS: The study included 1,186 articles in  total. The number of CSP articles has presented an overall increasing trend over  the last two decades. China has the maximum number of publications, but America's  H-index is higher than that of China, with the average number of citations per  item ranking fourth. The Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Research published  the most on the subject, while Zhejiang University from China published the  largest number of articles; Jurkovic D, Timor-Tritsch IE, and Monteagudo A have  achieved considerable progress in the CSP domain. There are 5 clusters that the  current research orientation can fall into: ""selection of the delivery mode with  a scarred uterus after cesarean section"", ""risk factors"", ""diagnosis"",  ""treatment"" and ""related basic and clinical experiments"". High-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU) and the formulation of consensus guidelines are the focus of  the current research. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of global trends shows that CSP  research is being actively studied and that the number of published studies is  continuously increasing. According to the comprehensive quality and quantity of  the literature, the United States maintains a leading position in CSP research.

Focal ablation using ultrasound-guided  high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has demonstrated promising short and  medium-term oncological outcomes. Advancements in HIFU therapy such as the  introduction of tissue change monitoring (TCM) aim to further improve treatment  efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between intraoperative TCM  during HIFU focal therapy for localized prostate cancer and oncological outcomes  12 mo afterward. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy consecutive men at a  single institution with prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled. Men with  prior treatment, metastases, or pelvic radiation were excluded to obtain a final  cohort of 55 men. INTERVENTION: All men underwent HIFU focal therapy followed by  magnetic resonance (MR)-fusion biopsy 12 mo later. Tissue change was quantified  intraoperatively by measuring the backscatter of ultrasound waves during  ablation. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Gleason grade group (GG)  ≥2 cancer on postablation biopsy was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes  included GG ≥1 cancer, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS)  scores ≥3, and evidence of tissue destruction on post-treatment magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI). A Student's t - test analysis was performed to evaluate  the mean TCM scores and efficacy of ablation measured by histopathology.  Multivariate logistic regression was also performed to identify the odds of  residual cancer for each unit increase in the TCM score. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS:  A lower mean TCM score within the region of the tumor (0.70 vs 0.97, p = 0.02)  was associated with the presence of persistent GG ≥2 cancer after HIFU treatment.  Adjusting for initial prostate-specific antigen, PI-RADS score, Gleason GG,  positive cores, and age, each incremental increase of TCM was associated with an  89% reduction in the odds (odds ratio: 0.11, confidence interval: 0.01-0.97) of  having residual GG ≥2 cancer on postablation biopsy. Men with higher mean TCM  scores (0.99 vs 0.72, p = 0.02) at the time of treatment were less likely to have  abnormal MRI (PI-RADS ≥3) at 12 mo postoperatively. Cases with high TCM scores  also had greater tissue destruction measured on MRI and fewer visible lesions on  postablation MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue change measured using TCM values during  focal HIFU of the prostate was associated with histopathology and radiological  outcomes 12 mo after the procedure. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we looked at  how well ultrasound changes of the prostate during focal high-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU) therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer predict patient  outcomes. We found that greater tissue change measured by the HIFU device was  associated with less residual cancer at 1 yr. This tool should be used to ensure  optimal ablation of the cancer and may improve focal therapy outcomes in the  future.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","584-591","","4","9","","Eur Urol Focus","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

The BBB expresses efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and  breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which limit the passage of substrate  molecules from blood circulation to the brain. Focused ultrasound (FUS) with  microbubbles can create a local and reversible detachment of the TJs. However,  very little is known about the effect of FUS on the expression of efflux  transporters. We investigated the in vivo effects of moderate acoustic pressures  on both P-gp and BCRP expression for up to two weeks after sonication. Magnetic  resonance-guided FUS was applied in the striatum of 12 rats. P-gp and BCRP  expression were determined by immunohistochemistry at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days  postFUS. Our results indicate that FUS-induced BBB opening is capable of (i)  decreasing P-gp expression up to 3 days after sonication in both the treated and  in the contralateral brain regions and is capable of (ii) overexpressing BCRP up  to 7 days after FUS in the sonicated regions only. Our findings may help improve  FUS-aided drug delivery strategies by considering both the mechanical effect on  the TJs and the regulation of P-gp and BCRP.","2022-12-07","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","24","23","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36555129  PMCID: PMC9779754","","","","*Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism; *Neoplasms/metabolism; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/metabolism; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2/genetics/metabolism; Animals; BBB-opening; Brain/metabolism; Endothelial Cells/metabolism; MRgFUS; Microbubbles; Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism; Pilot Projects; Rats; drug delivery; efflux transporter; focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At HIFU failure, data guiding salvage  treatment is limited to small retrospective series with short follow-up. We  evaluated our institutional experience using salvage radiation therapy (SRT)  after HIFU failure. MATERIALS/METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of  patients with local failure post-HIFU who received salvage image-guided external  beam radiation therapy (EBRT) delivered via intensity-modulated radiotherapy  (IMRT). Our primary endpoint was biochemical failure-free survival (bFFS) defined  as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir + 2 ng/mL. Secondary endpoints included  metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS). Endpoints were  evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2018, 12 out of 96  patients treated with primary HIFU received SRT via conventional or moderate  hypofractionation. Median time from HIFU to SRT was 13.5 months. Seven patients  had stage migration to high-risk disease at the time of SRT. Mean PSA prior to  SRT was 8.2ug/L and mean nadir post-SRT was 1.2ug/L. Acute International Prostate  Symptom Score (IPSS) as well as International Index of Erectile Dysfunction  (IIEF) scores were similar to baseline (p = 0.5 and 0.1, respectively). Late  toxicities were comparable to those reported after primary EBRT for localized  prostate cancer. At a median follow-up of 46 months, the OS was 100%. The 5-year  bFFS and MFS were both 83.3%. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, we report one of the  largest series on contemporary SRT post HIFU failure. We show that SRT is  feasible, effective and carries no additional acute or delayed toxicity.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1028858","","","12","","Front Oncol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Di Lalla, Elakshar, Anidjar, Tolba, Hassan, Bahoric, McPherson, Probst and Niazi.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36408146  PMCID: PMC9669274","","","","high-intensity focused ultrasound; localized prostate cancer; outcomes; prostate cancer treatment; salvage radiotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unlikely to cure patients with cancer,  especially those with large and irregular tumors and with tumors residing in  certain organs, such as the brain and pancreas, because of insufficient necrosis  generation.

However, the application against photo-damaged skin  remains obscure. This study evaluates the effect of HIFU against photoaged skin  using a mouse model. METHODS: A total of 60 mice were used and divided into 3  groups; group 1: natural aging control group (n = 20), group 2: UVB irradiation  group (n = 20), and group 3: UVB irradiation followed by HIFU treatment (n = 20).  The evaluation was made grossly by analyzing wrinkles and histologically by  performing H&E, Toluidine Blue, Masson's Trichrome, and immunohistochemistry for  TGF-β and MMP3. Imaging software was used to quantify the findings. RESULTS:  Gross findings showed HIFU treated group 3 with similar findings with the control  group supporting the rejuvenation effect for photo-aged skin. Histology findings  with H&E show a significant reduction in skin thickness after HIFU treatment  (60.115 units (group 2) vs. 40.853 units (group 3), p<0.05). Toluidine Blue and  Masson's Trichrome showed improved collagen array and significantly increased  distribution for group 3 over group 2 (272,879.88 units (group 2) vs. 533,805.78  units (group 3), p<0.05). Immunohistochemistry for TGF-β showed a significantly  higher value for group 3 (2.45450 units) over group 2 (0.58880 units) and MMP3  with a significantly lower value for group 3 (99,180 units) over group 2 (559,830  units) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of HIFU supports the rejuvenation  effect for photoaged skin. Findings show that HIFU provides benefits of collagen  formation and rearrangement by enhancing TGF-β and inhibiting MMP3 activity. This  study is the first animal study to show the direct effect of HIFU on photo-aged  skin further supporting the use of HIFU in aging skin aiming to reverse the  morphological effects of aging.","2022-10","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","3859-3868","","10","75","","J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

In recent years, HIFU combined  with TACE has been frequently reported, but researchers have not yet reached a  uniform conclusion on the efficacy and safety of this treatment modality.  METHODS: The Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biomedical  Literature Database, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase databases were  searched using the terms ""randomized controlled trial (RCT)"", ""liver cancer"",  ""transarterial chemoembolization"", ""TACE"", ""high intensity focused ultrasound"",  ""HIFU"", ""HIFU combined with TACE"", and ""efficacy analysis"". Studies were included  in accordance with the PICOS principle, and risk of bias was assessed in  randomized controlled trials in accordance with the Cochrane Manual for  Systematic Evaluation of Interventions.

The BH treatment generates bubbles that move within the  sonicated volume due to acoustic radiation force. Since the velocity of the  bubbles and tissue debris is expected to depend on the lesion size and  liquefaction completeness, it could provide a quantitative metric of the  treatment progression. In this study, the motion of bubble remnants and tissue  debris immediately following BH pulses was investigated using high-pulse  repetition frequency (PRF) plane-wave color Doppler ultrasound in ex vivo  myocardium tissue. A 256-element 1.5 MHz spiral HIFU array with a coaxially  integrated ultrasound imaging probe (ATL P4-2) produced 10 ms BH pulses to form  volumetric lesions with electronic beam steering. Prior to performing volumetric  BH treatments, the motion of intact myocardium tissue and anticoagulated bovine  blood following isolated BH pulses was assessed as two limiting cases. In the  liquid blood the velocity of BH-induced streaming at the focus reached over 200  cm/s, whereas the intact tissue was observed to move toward the HIFU array  consistent with elastic rebound of tissue. Over the course of volumetric BH  treatments tissue motion at the focus locations was dependent on the axial size  of the forming lesion relative to the corresponding size of the HIFU focal area.  For axially small lesions, the maximum velocity after the BH pulse was directed  toward the HIFU transducer and monotonically increased over time from about  20-100 cm/s as liquefaction progressed, then saturated when tissue was fully  liquefied. For larger lesions obtained by merging multiple smaller lesions in the  axial direction, the high-speed streaming away from the HIFU transducer was  observed at the point of full liquefaction.

The shape and size of pressure fields  generated by strongly focused transducers with an f-number equal to 0.75  operating at frequencies up to 20 MHz are analyzed analytically using the  Lucas-Muir model and numerically with the wide-angle  Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov method. The modeling results under quasi-linear  conditions are compared against measurements performed in an acoustic tank with  the aid of a fiberoptic hydrophone. The size of the focal zone expressed by their  depth of focus and focal diameter is found to be directly controlled by their  operating frequency and f-number. Devices manufactured for an operating frequency  of 20 MHz are characterized by their 6 dB depth of focus of 490 μm and focal  diameter of 80.6 µm. The devices are further studied at high power levels using a  polyacrylic tissue-mimicking phantom. The devices are equipped with an optical  observation system allowing simultaneous treatment and observation of the skin  surface.

Fortunately, radiotherapy (RT) gives rise to a  common clinical treatment method, during which the usage of radiosensitizers is  essential. Among preclinical radiosensitizers, bismuth-based nanoparticles  (Bi-based NPs) are widely explored in cancer diagnosis and treatment, because  they share favourable properties, such as low toxicity, strong X-ray absorption  and facile preparation. However, pure Bi alone cannot achieve both efficient and  safe RT outcomes, mainly due to poor targeting of tumor sites, long  retention-induced systemic toxicity and immune resistance. This work provides an  overview of recent advances and developments in Bi-based NPs that are tailored to  enhance radiosensitivity. For the fabrication process, surface modification of  Bi-based NPs is essential to achieve tumor-targeted delivery and penetration.  Moreover, the incorporation of other elements, such as Fe ions, can increase  diagnostic accuracy with optimal theranostic efficacy. Meanwhile, the  structure-activity relationship can also be manipulated to maximize the  chemotherapeutic drug loading capability of Bi-based NPs, to enhance X-ray  attenuation by means of a large surface area or to achieve safer metabolic routes  with rapid clearance from the human body. In addition, Bi-based NPs exhibit  synergistic antitumor potential when combined with diverse therapies, such as  photothermal therapy (PTT) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). To  summarize, the latest research on Bi-based NPs as radiosensitizers is described  in the review, including both their advantages and disadvantages for improving  treatment, thus providing a useful guide for future clinical application.","2022-06-16","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","8245-8254","","23","14","","Nanoscale","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35647806","","","","*Nanoparticles/therapeutic use; *Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy; Bismuth/pharmacology; Humans; Phototherapy/methods; Radiation Tolerance; Theranostic Nanomedicine/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: 0.5 M  (gadoteridol and gadobenate dimeglumine) and diluted formulations (1:10  gadoteridol in saline) were exposed to different HIFU sequences. Unexposed and  exposed solutions were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography in  terms of concentration of gadolinium complex, free gadolinium and free ligand.  RESULTS: Gadoteridol formulation after treatment showed concentrations of the  complex not significantly different from control.

Local treatments such as salvage surgery and re-irradiation are usually  traumatic and have limited efficacy. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)  treatment can directly ablate solid tumors without damaging neighboring healthy  tissue. However, the HIFU studies for these patients are limited. Experience  gained over the course of 10 years with the use of HIFU for the management of  residual/recurrent cervical cancer after chemoradiotherapy is reported herein.  METHODS: 153 patients with residual/recurrent cervical cancer in a previously  irradiated field who received HIFU treatment between 2010 and 2021 were  retrospectively analyzed. Adverse effects, survival benefit and factors affecting  prognosis were given particular attention. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients  (23.5%) achieved a partial response following HIFU treatment and 107 patients  (69.9%) had stable disease. The objective response and disease control rates were  23.5% and 93.5%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) and  median overall survival (mOS) were 17.0 months and 24.5 months, respectively.  Moreover, patients with lesions ≥1.40 cm before HIFU treatment and a shrinkage  rate ≥ 30% after treatment had a higher mPFS and mOS, and patients with lesions  ≤1.00 cm after HIFU treatment had a higher mPFS (P=<0.05). All the  treatment-related adverse events were limited to minor complications, which  included skin burns, abdominal pain and vaginal discharge. CONCLUSIONS: HIFU  treatment is likely a preferred option for cervical cancer patients with residual  disease or recurrence following CRT that can safely improve the local control  rate and extend survival.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","995930","","","13","","Front Immunol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Zhong, Tang, Ni, Chen, Liu, Wu, Zhou, Feng, Lu, Tan and Zhang.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36325337  PMCID: PMC9618866","","","","*Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/therapy; Chemoradiotherapy/adverse effects; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/therapy; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; ablation; cervical cancer; high-intensity focused ultrasound; neoplasm recurrence; residual diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This drive has resulted in breakthrough in technologies such as the  application of ultrasound (US) in demulsification and enhanced oil recovery  (EOR), and usage of high-volume hydraulic fracturing and special horizontal well  for shale oil and gas extraction. These can be observed in the increment in the  number of commercial oil technologies such as EOR projects that rose from 237 in  1996 to 375 in 2017. This sustained expansion in EOR resulted in their total oil  production rising from 1.5 million barrels per day in 2005 to 2.3 million barrels  per day in 2020. And this is predicted to increase to about 4.7 million barrels  per day in 2040, which represent about 4% of total production. Consequently, in  this review, the developments in the utilization of US either as standalone or  integrated with other technologies in EOR and dehydration of water in oil  emulsions were analyzed. The studies include the optimization of fluid and US  properties in EOR and demulsification. Reports on the treatment of formation  damage resulting from inorganic salts, organic scales, drilling fluid plugs,  condensate, paraffin wax and colloidal particle with US-assisted EOR were also  highlighted. Moreover, the mechanisms were examined in order to gain insightful  understanding and to aid research investigations in these areas. Technologies  such as US assisted green demulsification, high intensity focused ultrasound, and  potential pathways in field studies were assessed for their feasibilities. It is  essential to evaluate these technologies due to the significant accrued benefits  in them. The usage of green demulsifiers such as deep eutectic solvents, ionic  liquids and bio-demulsifiers has promising future outlook and US could enhance  their technical advancement. HiFU has been applied successfully in clinical  research and developments in this area can potentiality improve demulsification  and interfacial studies (fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interactions). As regards  field studies, there is need to increase actual well investigations because  present reports have few on-site measurements with most studies being in  laboratory scale. Furthermore, there is need for more detailed modeling of these  technologies as it would assist in conserving resources, saving research time and  fast-tracking oil production. Additional evaluative studies of conditions such as  the usage of Raschig rings, crude oil salinity and high temperature which have  improved demulsification of crude oil emulsions should be pursued.","2022-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","105902","","","82","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

High-intensity focused ultrasound  (HiFU) is a local treatment modality that uses ultrasound waves to ablate  prostate cancer. In case of treatment failure, optimal salvage modality after  HiFU remains unclear. METHODS: Here, we describe a retrospective review of our  regional cancer database for men who underwent salvage radiotherapy after failure  of HiFU treatment for prostate cancer. Oncologic and toxicity outcomes of the men  identified in our database are discussed. RESULTS: We identified 14 men in our  regional database who received salvage radiotherapy (70-74 Gy with or without  androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) after primary HiFU, in the period of  2009-2017. No cases of any grade 3 or higher toxicity were observed. In our  cohort, 50% (7/14) of patients developed secondary biochemical failure at a  median follow-up of 54 months post-radiotherapy, with a mean time to biochemical  failure of 39 months. We compare our data to other available reports to date  consisting mostly of small, non-randomized studies. Our biochemical control rates  are noticeably lower compared with those reported by other studies but our length  of follow-up is longer, compared with other studies.

Various therapeutic genes are also harbored into these engineering  bacteria to enhance their anti-tumor efficacy. However, it is difficult to  spatiotemporally control the expression of these inserted genes in the tumor  site. Here, we engineer an ultrasound-responsive bacterium (URB) which can induce  the expression of exogenous genes in an ultrasound-controllable manner. Owing to  the advantage of ultrasound in tissue penetration, an acoustic remote control of  bacterial gene expression can be realized by designing a temperature-actuated  genetic switch. Cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ), an important immune regulatory  molecule that plays a significant role in tumor immunotherapy, is used to test  the system. Our results show that brief hyperthermia induced by focused  ultrasound promotes the expression of IFN-γ gene, improving anti-tumor efficacy  of URB in vitro and in vivo. Our study provides an alternative strategy for  bacteria-mediated tumor immunotherapy.","2022-08-02","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","4468","","1","13","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.
