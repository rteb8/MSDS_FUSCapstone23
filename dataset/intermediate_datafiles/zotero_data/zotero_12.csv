However, its clinical significance in different tumor types is not  fully understood. To assess its therapeutic efficacy and immunomodulatory  properties, we compared HIFU thermal ablation and histotripsy ablation in dogs  with spontaneous tumors. We also evaluated the ability of non-ablative HIFU-based  mild hyperthermia (40-45 ºC) to improve Doxorubicin delivery and  immunomodulation. Our results showed that HIFU thermal ablation induced tumor  remission in the majority of treated patients over 60 days, while histotripsy  achieved partial response to stable disease persistence. The adverse effects of  thermal ablation were minor to moderate, while histotripsy exposures were  relatively well-tolerated. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between  HIFU-therapeutic response and serum anti-tumor cytokine profiles and the presence  of functionally active cytotoxic immune cells in patients. Similarly,  Doxorubicin-treated patients showed improved drug delivery, efficacy, and  anti-tumor immune responses with HIFU hyperthermia. In conclusion, our study  demonstrates that depending on the tumor type and treatment parameters, HIFU  treatments can enable tumor growth control, immune activation, and chemotherapy  in veterinary patient. These findings have significant clinical implications and  highlight the potential of HIFU as a promising cancer treatment approach.","2023-05-10","2024-03-18 17:30:28","2024-03-18T17:30:28Z","","","","","","","Ann Biomed Eng","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

In this review article, we  outline the incidence, pathophysiology, predictors, and preventative strategies  of this dreaded complication. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search in 10  databases/electronic search engines to access relevant publications. All articles  reporting complications following atrial fibrillation ablation, including  esophageal injury and fistula formation, were included for systematic review.  RESULTS: A total of 130 manuscripts were identified for the final review process.  The overall incidence of esophageal injury following atrial fibrillation ablation  was significantly higher with thermal ablation modalities (radiofrequency 5-40%,  cryoballoon 3-25%, high-intensity focused ultrasound < 10%) as opposed to  non-thermal ablation modalities (no cases reported to date). The incidence of  esophageal perforation and fistula formation with the use of thermal ablation  modalities is estimated to occur in less than 0.25% of all atrial fibrillation  ablation procedures. The use of luminal esophageal temperature monitoring probe  and mechanical esophageal deviation showed protective effect toward reducing the  incidence of this complication. The prognosis is very poor for patients who  develop atrioesophageal fistula, and the condition is rapidly fatal without  surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal perforation and fistula formation  following atrial fibrillation ablation are rare complications with poor  prognosis. Various strategies have been proposed to protect the esophagus and  reduce the incidence of this fearful complication. Pulsed field ablation is a  promising new ablation technology that may be the future answer toward reducing  the incidence of esophageal complications.","2024-03","2024-03-06 17:04:09","2024-03-06T17:04:09Z","","409-424","","2","67","","J Interv Card Electrophysiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Multiple previous studies have  concluded that a large incidence angle should be avoided during  transcranial-focused ultrasound therapy to ensure transmission through the skull.  Alternatively, some other studies have shown that longitudinal-to-shear wave mode  conversion might improve transmission through the skull when the incidence angle  is increased above the critical angle (i.e., 25° to 30°). PURPOSE: The effect of  skull porosity on the transmission of ultrasound through the skull at varying  incidence angles was investigated for the first time to elucidate why  transmission through the skull at large angles of incidence is decreased in some  cases but improved in other cases. METHODS: Transcranial ultrasound transmission  at varying incidence angles (0°-50°) was investigated in phantoms and ex vivo  skull samples with varying bone porosity (0% to 28.54% ± 3.36%) using both  numerical and experimental methods. First, the elastic acoustic wave transmission  through the skull was simulated using micro-computed tomography data of ex vivo  skull samples. The trans-skull pressure was compared between skull segments  having three levels of porosity, that is, low porosity (2.65% ± 0.03%), medium  porosity (13.41% ± 0.12%), and high porosity (26.9%). Next, transmission through  two 3D-printed resin skull phantoms (compact vs. porous phantoms) was  experimentally measured to test the effect of porous microstructure alone on  ultrasound transmission through flat plates. Finally, the effect of skull  porosity on ultrasound transmission was investigated experimentally by comparing  transmission through two ex vivo human skull segments having similar thicknesses  but different porosities (13.78% ± 2.05% vs. 28.54% ± 3.36%). RESULTS: Numerical  simulations indicated that an increase in transmission pressure occurs at large  incidence angles for skull segments having low porosities but not for those with  high porosity. In experimental studies, a similar phenomenon was observed.  Specifically, for the low porosity skull sample (13.78% ± 2.05%), the normalized  pressure was 0.25 when the incidence angle increased to 35°. However, for the  high porosity sample (28.54% ± 3.36%), the pressure was no more than 0.1 at large  incidence angles. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the skull porosity has  an evident effect on the transmission of ultrasound at large incidence angles.  The wave mode conversion at large, oblique incidence angles could enhance the  transmission of ultrasound through parts of the skull having lower porosity in  the trabecular layer. However, for transcranial ultrasound therapy in the  presence of highly porous trabecular bone, transmission at a normal incidence  angle is preferable relative to oblique incidence angles due to the higher  transmission efficiency.","2023-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","3092-3102","","5","50","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36810723","","","","*Skull/diagnostic imaging; Humans; Incidence; Porosity; Ultrasonography; X-Ray Microtomography; incidence angle; mode conversion; porosity; shear wave; transcranial ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The resulting  mechanical disruption permeabilizes the tissue and enhances the diffusion of  systemically administered drugs. This is especially beneficial for tissues with  poor perfusion such as pancreatic tumors. Here, we characterize the performance  of a dual-mode ultrasound array designed for image-guided pHIFU therapies in  producing inertial cavitation and ultrasound imaging. The 64-element linear array  (1.071 MHz, an aperture of 14.8×51.2 mm, and a pitch of 0.8 mm) with an  elevational focal length of 50 mm was driven by the Verasonics V-1 ultrasound  system with extended burst option. The attainable focal pressures and electronic  steering range in linear and nonlinear operating regimes (relevant to pHIFU  treatments) were characterized through hydrophone measurements, acoustic  holography, and numerical simulations. The steering range at ±10% from the  nominal focal pressure was found to be ±6 mm axially and ±11 mm azimuthally.  Focal waveforms with shock fronts of up to 45 MPa and peak negative pressures up  to 9 MPa were achieved at focusing distances of 38-75 mm from the array.  Cavitation behaviors induced by isolated 1-ms pHIFU pulses in optically  transparent agarose gel phantoms were observed by high-speed photography across a  range of excitation amplitudes and focal distances. For all focusing  configurations, the appearance of sparse, stationary cavitation bubbles occurred  at the same P(-) threshold of 2 MPa. As the output level increased, a qualitative  change in cavitation behavior occurred, to pairs and sets of proliferating  bubbles. The pressure P(-) at which this transition was observed corresponded to  substantial nonlinear distortion and shock formation in the focal region and was  thus dependent on the focal distance of the beam ranging within 3-4 MPa for  azimuthal F -numbers of 0.74-1.5. The array was capable of B-mode imaging at 1.5  MHz of centimeter-sized targets in phantoms and in vivo pig tissues at depths of  3-7 cm, relevant to pHIFU applications in abdominal targets.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","693-707","","7","70","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37074881  PMCID: PMC10712801","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Pancreatic Neoplasms; Animals; Contrast Media; Microbubbles; Phantoms, Imaging; Swine; Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Surgical procedures to address obstructing ureteroliths  have short- and long-term complications, and medical therapies (e.g., fluid  diuresis and smooth muscle relaxants) are infrequently effective. Burst wave  lithotripsy is a non-invasive, ultrasound-guided, handheld focused ultrasound  technology to disintegrate urinary stones, which is now undergoing human clinical  trials in awake unanesthetized subjects. RESULTS: In this study, we designed and  performed in vitro testing of a modified burst wave lithotripsy system to  noninvasively fragment stones in cats. The design accounted for differences in  anatomic scale, acoustic window, skin-to-stone depth, and stone size. Prototypes  were fabricated and tested in a benchtop model using 35 natural calcium oxalate  monohydrate stones from cats. In an initial experiment, burst wave lithotripsy  was performed using peak ultrasound pressures of 7.3 (n = 10), 8.0 (n = 5), or  8.9 MPa (n = 10) for up to 30 min. Fourteen of 25 stones fragmented to < 1 mm  within the 30 min. In a second experiment, burst wave lithotripsy was performed  using a second transducer and peak ultrasound pressure of 8.0 MPa (n = 10) for up  to 50 min. In the second experiment, 9 of 10 stones fragmented to < 1 mm within  the 50 min. Across both experiments, an average of 73-97% of stone mass could be  reduced to fragments < 1 mm. A third experiment found negligible injury with in  vivo exposure of kidneys and ureters in a porcine animal model.

However, the outcomes of SDT are typically hampered by the low oxygen  content and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Accordingly,  we constructed a cascade nanoplatform to regulate the TME and improve the  anti-tumor efficiency of SDT. METHODS: In this study, we rationally design  cascade nanoplatform by incorporating immunostimulant hyaluronic acid (HA) and  sonosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) on the polydopamine nanocarrier that is pre-doped  with platinum nanozymes (designated Ce6/Pt@PDA-HA, PPCH). RESULTS: The cascade  reactions of PPCH are evidenced by the results that HA exhibits reversing  immunosuppressive that converts M2 macrophages into M1 macrophages in situ, while  producing H(2)O(2), and then platinum nanozymes further catalyze the H(2)O(2) to  produce O(2), and O(2) produces abundant singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) under the  action of Ce6 and low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), resulting in a domino  effect and further amplifying the efficacy of SDT. Due to its pH responsiveness  and mitochondrial targeting, PPCH effectively accumulates in tumor cells. Under  LIFU irradiation, PPCH effectively reverses immunosuppression, alleviates hypoxia  in the TME, enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and enhances SDT  efficacy for eliminating tumor cells in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, an in vivo  dual-modal imaging including fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging achieves  precise tumor diagnosis. CONCLUSION: This cascade nanoplatform will provide a  promising strategy for enhancing SDT eradication against tumors by modulating  immunosuppression and relieving hypoxia.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","6667-6687","","","18","","Int J Nanomedicine","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Du et al.","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 38026520  PMCID: PMC10656771","","","","*Nanoparticles/chemistry; *Porphyrins/pharmacology/chemistry; *Ultrasonic Therapy/methods; Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hypoxia; Platinum; Reactive Oxygen Species; Tumor Microenvironment; cascade reactions; sonodynamic therapy; tumor hypoxia; tumor microenvironment; tumor-associated macrophages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Surgical options carry disadvantages, such as the  usage of anesthetics, swelling, pain and long time for recovery, so there is a  growing public request for the techniques with fewer side effects and shorter  recovery periods. Several new noninvasive body contouring ways have been advanced  such as, cryolipolysis radiofrequency energy, suction-massage, high-frequency  focused ultrasound, and laser therapy. Noninvasive laser improves the body's  appearance by the elimination of excess adipose tissue, specifically in areas in  which fat perseveres in spite of diet and exercise. METHODS: In this study the  efficacy of Endolift laser was evaluated for reduction of excess fat in the arms  and under abdomen. Ten patients with excess fat in the arms and under abdomen  were enrolled in this study. The patients were treated by Endolift laser in the  arms and under abdomen areas. The outcomes were evaluated by two blinded board  certified dermatologists and by patients' satisfaction. The circumference of each  arm and under abdomen was measured using a flexible tape measure. RESULTS: The  results showed reduction in the fat and circumference of arms and under abdomen  after treatment. The treatment was considered as effective methods with high  patient satisfaction. Also no severe adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSION:  Endolift laser can be a good alternative to surgical body fat contouring due to  its efficacy, safety, minimal recovery time, low cost. Also Endolift laser does  not require general anesthetics.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2018-2022","","7","22","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

Eight patients underwent resting-state MEG  with repeated recordings before and 1 and 6 months after MRgFUS-capsulotomy, and  the oscillatory power and phase coherence over the entire cortical sensor area  were measured. After MRgFUS-capsulotomy, the high beta band power in the  fronto-central and temporal areas decreased at 1 month and remained stable for 6  months. Cortical connectivity of the high beta band gradually decreased over the  entire cortical area during the following 6 months. At 1 month, improvement in  anxiety and depression symptoms was significantly correlated with changes in high  beta band power in both the frontotemporal and temporal areas.

The particle size of TiO(2) is an important factor that significantly influences its activity  during photocatalytic degradation. In the presence of liquid, the properties of  nanopowders composed of exactly the same product clearly differ according to  their aggregation size. In this study, TiO(2) nanoparticles with a controlled  size were fabricated by focused ultrasound dispersion. The high energy generated  by this system was used to control the size of TiO(2) particles in the  suspension. The constant high energy released by cavitation enabled the  dispersion of the particles without a surfactant. The activities of the prepared  TiO(2) photocatalysts for methylene blue (MB) degradation were then compared. The  dye degradation effect of the photocatalyst was as high as 61.7% after 10 min  when the size of the powder was controlled in the solution, but it was only as  high as 41.0% when the aggregation size was not controlled. Furthermore, when the  TiO(2) concentration exceeded a certain level, the photocatalytic activity of  TiO(2) decreased. Controlling the size of the aggregated photocatalyst particles  is, therefore, essential in water-treatment technologies utilizing TiO(2)  photocatalytic properties, and adjusting the TiO(2) concentration is an important  economic factor in this photocatalytic technology. This study contributes to the  development of processes for degrading dyes, such as MB, released from wastewater  into aquatic environments.","2023-01-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","2","13","","Nanomaterials (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36678052  PMCID: PMC9863734","","","","TiO2; advanced oxidation process; degradation; methylene blue; microparticle; nanoparticle; ultrasonic dispersion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BBBD depends to a great extent on MB oscillations. Because the brain vasculature  is heterogenic in diameter, reduced MB oscillations in smaller blood vessels,  together with a lower number of MBs in capillaries, can lead to variations in  BBBD. Therefore, evaluating the impact of microvasculature diameter on BBBD is of  great importance. We present a method to characterize molecules extravasation  following FUS-mediated BBBD, at a single blood vessel resolution. Evans blue (EB)  leakage was used as marker for BBBD, whereas blood vessels localization was done  using FITC labeled Dextran. Automated image processing pipeline was developed to  quantify the extent of extravasation as function of microvasculature diameter,  including a wide range of vascular morphological parameters. Variations in MB  vibrational response were observed in blood vessel mimicking fibers with varied  diameters. Higher peak negative pressures (PNP) were required to initiate stable  cavitation in fibers with smaller diameters. In vivo in the treated brains, EB  extravasation increased as a function of blood vessel diameter. The percentage of  strong BBBD blood vessels increased from 9.75% for 2-3 μm blood vessels to 91.67%  for 9-10 μm. Using this method, it is possible to conduct a diameter-dependent  analysis that measures vascular leakage resulting from FUS-mediated BBBD at a  single blood vessel resolution.","2023-06-16","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","106965","","6","26","","iScience","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Author(s).","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37378309  PMCID: PMC10291464","","","","Biomaterials; Biomedical engineering; Engineering; Materials science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we  report the use of a new proposed sonosensitizer, carbon dots (C-dots), to  assemble microbubbles with a gas core (C-dots MBs).

In in vitro  experiments, treatment with C-dots MBs plus US induced lipid peroxidation,  elevation of intracellular ROS, and apoptosis in 32.5%, 45.3%, and 50.1% of cells  respectively. In an animal solid tumor model, treatment with C-dots MBs plus US  resulted in a 3-fold and 2.5-fold increase in the proportion of ROS-damaged cells  and apoptotic cells, respectively, compared to C-dots MBs alone.

This is very important for the effective implementation of  ultrasound not only in diagnosis but especially in treatment for the future.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: An evaluation of acoustic and thermal properties of plaque  phantoms to test their suitability mainly for ultrasound imaging and therapy was  presented. The evaluation included measurements of the acoustic propagation speed  using pulse-echo technique, ultrasonic attenuation coefficient using through  transmission immersion technique, and absorption coefficient. Moreover, thermal  properties (thermal conductivity, volumetric specific heat capacity and thermal  diffusivity) were measured with the transient method using a needle probe.  RESULTS: It was shown that acoustic and thermal properties of atherosclerotic  plaque phantoms fall well within the range of reported values for atherosclerotic  plaque and slightly different for thermal diffusivity and volumetric specific  heat capacity for soft tissues. The mean value of acoustic and thermal properties  and their standard deviation of plaque phantoms were 1523 ± 23 m/s for acoustic  speed, 0.50 ± 0.02 W/mK for thermal conductivity, 0.30 ± 0.21 db/cm-MHz for  ultrasonic absorption coefficient and 1.63 ± 0.46 db/cm-MHz for ultrasonic  attenuation coefficient. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that acoustic and  thermal properties of atherosclerotic plaque phantoms were within the range of  reported values. Future studies should be focused on the optimum recipe of the  atherosclerotic plaque phantoms that mimics the human atherosclerotic plaque  (agar 4% w/v, gypsum 10% w/v and butter 10% w/v) and can be used for HIFU  therapy.","2023-04-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","J Ultrasound","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

However, the different effects of  ultrasound propagating in different media make the specific target and process of  ultrasound in AAO remain unclear, and the effects of ultrasound on AAO reported  in previous studies are contradictory. These uncertainties have greatly limited  the application of ultrasonic-assisted anodization (UAA) in practice. In this  study, the bubble desorption and mass transfer enhancement effects were decoupled  based on an anodizing system with focused ultrasound, such that the dual effects  of ultrasound on different targets were distinguished. The results showed that  ultrasound has the dual effects on AAO fabrication. Specifically, ultrasound  focused on the anode has a nanopore-expansion effect on AAO, leading to a 12.24 %  improvement in fabrication efficiency. This was attributed to the promotion of  interfacial ion migration through ultrasonic-induced high-frequency vibrational  bubble desorption. However, AAO nanopores were observed to shrink when ultrasound  was focused on the electrolyte, accompanied by a 25.85 % reduction in fabrication  efficiency. The effects of ultrasound on mass transfer through jet cavitation  appeared to be the reason for this phenomenon. This study resolved the  paradoxical phenomena of UAA in previous studies and is expected to guide AAO  application in electrochemistry and surface treatments.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","106431","","","96","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Using  the methodology of digital twins, consisting of virtual and physical twins, an  ultrasonic transducer has been developed that emits a focused ultrasound signal  that penetrates into deeper biological tissues.

The virtual twin simulation  shows that the acoustic signal emitted by the ring-shaped transducer, which is  excited by a higher vibrational mode, is concentrated into a narrower and more  precise acoustic wave that penetrates deeper into the biological tissue and  affects only the part of the body to be treated, but not the whole body.","2023-03-30","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","7","23","","Sensors (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37050668  PMCID: PMC10098853","","","","*Sonication; *Ultrasonics; Equipment Design; FEM; Humans; Transducers; Ultrasonography; acoustic intensity; deep penetration; higher vibration mode; targeted acoustic wave","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Differentiating the underlying  etiology can be a challenge for both medical students and seasoned clinicians  alike. Because this scenario can represent a time-sensitive emergency, developing  skills to diagnose the underlying cause quickly and accurately is essential for  proper management, whether the patient would benefit from osteopathic  manipulation, prompt administration of antibiotics, or a more invasive procedure  like joint aspiration or surgery. OBJECTIVES: The objectives are to determine the  effects of a focused ultrasound training on first-year osteopathic medical  students' ability to identify normal sonographic anatomy of the anterior knee and  to differentiate between three common pathologies: joint effusion, prepatellar  bursitis, and cellulitis. METHODS: First-year osteopathic medical students  voluntarily participated in this cross-sectional study. The study protocol  included a focused ultrasound training (online materials, brief didactic and  single hands-on sessions) followed by a hands-on assessment. A written test and  5-point Likert scale questionnaire were administered before and after the focused  training. Nine weeks later, students completed a follow-up written test. The  proportion of students who correctly identified common pathologies on written  tests before (pretest) and after (posttest) training and on the follow-up written  test were compared utilizing the Fisher's exact test. A t test was utilized to  compare data from the pretraining and posttraining questionnaires. RESULTS: Of  101 students completing the written pretest and pretraining questionnaire, 95  (94.1 %) completed the written posttest and posttraining questionnaire, and 84  (83.2 %) completed the follow-up written test. Students had limited previous  experience with ultrasound; 90 (89.1 %) students had performed six or fewer  ultrasound examinations before the focused ultrasound training. On written tests,  students accurately identified joint effusion (22.8 % [23/101] pretest, 65.3 %  [62/95] posttest, 33.3 % [28/84] follow-up test), prepatellar bursitis (14.9 %  [15/101] pretest, 46.3 % [44/95] posttest, 36.9 % [31/84] follow-up test), and  cellulitis (38.6 % [39/101] pretest, 90.5 % [86/95] posttest, 73.8 % [62/84]  follow-up test). Differences were found between pretest and posttest for  identification of all three pathologies (all p<0.001) and between the pretest and  9-week follow-up test for identification of prepatellar bursitis and cellulitis  (both p≤0.001). For questionnaires, (where 1=strongly agree, 5=strongly  disagree), the mean (standard deviation [SD]) confidence for correctly  identifying normal sonographic anatomy of the anterior knee was 3.50 (1.01) at  pretraining and 1.59 (0.72) at posttraining. Student confidence in the ability to  differentiate joint effusion, prepatellar bursitis, and cellulitis utilizing  ultrasound increased from 4.33 (0.78) at pretraining to 1.99 (0.78) at  posttraining. For the hands-on assessment, 78.3 % (595 correct/760 aggregated  responses) of the time students correctly identified specific sonographic  landmarks of the anterior knee. When the evaluation combined real-time scanning  with a prerecorded sonographic video clip of the anterior knee, 71.4 % (20/28)  accurately identified joint effusion, 60.9 % (14/23) correctly diagnosed  prepatellar bursitis, 93.3 % (28/30) recognized cellulitis, and 47.1 % (8/17)  diagnosed the normal knee. CONCLUSIONS: Our focused training was effective at  immediately increasing basic knowledge, as well as confidence of first-year  osteopathic medical students when assessing the anterior knee with point-of-care  ultrasound. However, spaced repetition and deliberate practice may be useful for  learning retention.","2023-09-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","475-484","","10","123","","J Osteopath Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 37409566","","","","*Bursitis; *Students, Medical; Cellulitis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Point-of-Care Systems; curriculum; medical education; medical students; osteopathic; ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, in this  study, the high frequency focused ultrasound emulsification of oil droplets in  water was investigated through experiments and numerical modeling. The effect of  transducer power (74-400 W), frequency (1.1 and 3.3 MHz), oil viscosity (10.6-512  mPas), interfacial tension (25-250 mN/m) and initial droplet radius (10-750 µm)  on the emulsification process was assessed. In addition, the mechanism of droplet  break-up was examined. The experiments showed that the acoustic pressure  increased from 9.01 MPa to 26.24 MPa as the power was raised from 74 W to 400 W.  At 74 W, the Weber number (We) at the surface and focal zone are 0.5 and 939.8,  respectively. However, at 400 W, the We at the transducer surface and focal  region reached 2.7 and 6451.8, respectively. Thus, bulb-like and weak  catastrophic break up dominates the emulsification at 74 W. The catastrophic  break up at 400 W is more vigorous because the ultrasound disruptive stress and  We are higher. The time for the catastrophic dispersion of a single droplet at  We = 939.8 and We = 6451.8 are 1.01 ms and 0.45 ms, respectively. The numerical  model gives reasonable prediction of the trend and magnitude of the experimental  acoustic pressure data. The surface and focal pressure amplitudes were estimated  with errors of ∼ 6.5% and ∼ 10%, respectively. The predicted Reynolds number (Re)  between 74 and 400 W were 8442 and 21364, respectively. The acoustic pressure at  the focal region were ∼ 26 MPa and ∼ 69 MPa at frequencies of 1.1 MHz and  3.3 MHz, respectively. Moreover, the acoustic velocities were ∼ 16 m/s  and ∼ 42 m/s at 1.1 MHz and 3.3 MHz, respectively. Hence, smaller droplets could  be attained at higher frequency excitation under intense catastrophic modes. The  Ohnesorge number (Oh) increased from 0.062 to 3.12 with the viscosity between  10.6 mPas and 530 mPas. However, the We remained constant at 856.14 for the  studied range. Generally, higher critical We is required for the different  breakup stages as the viscosity ratio is elevated. Moreover, the We increased  from 25.68 to 1284.22 as the droplet radius was elevated from 15 to 750 µm.  Larger droplets allow for higher possibility and intensity of breakup due to  diminished viscous and interfacial resistance.","2023-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","106566","","","99","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Herein, we present the development  and evaluation of an anatomically accurate mouse phantom intended for  image-guided thermal ablation and Focused Ultrasound (FUS) applications. The  proposed mouse model consists of skeletal and soft tissue mimics, whose design  was based on the Computed tomography (CT) scans data of a live mouse.  Advantageously, it is compatible with US, CT, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (MRI). The compatibility assessment was focused on the radiological behavior of  the phantom due to the lack of relevant literature. The X-ray linear attenuation  coefficient of candidate materials was estimated to assess the one that matches  best the radiological behavior of living tissues. The bone part was manufactured  by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printing using Acrylonitrile styrene acrylate  (ASA) material. For the soft-tissue mimic, a special mold was 3D printed having a  cavity with the unique shape of the mouse body and filled with an agar-based  silica-doped gel. The mouse phantom accurately matched the size and reproduced  the body surface of the imaged mouse. Tissue-equivalency in terms of X-ray  attenuation was demonstrated for the agar-based soft-tissue mimic. The phantom  demonstrated excellent MRI visibility of the skeletal and soft-tissue mimics.  Good radiological contrast between the skeletal and soft-tissue models was also  observed in the CT scans. The model was also able to reproduce realistic behavior  during trans-skull sonication as proved by thermocouple measurements. Overall,  the proposed phantom is inexpensive, ergonomic, and realistic. It could  constitute a powerful tool for image-guided thermal ablation and FUS studies in  terms of testing and optimizing the performance of relevant equipment and  protocols. It also possess great potential for use in transcranial FUS  applications, including the emerging topic of FUS-mediated blood brain barrier  (BBB) disruption.","2023-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","106955","","","131","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

However, this is not true for all cases, even for successful ablation. How  the brain differs in patients with ET between those with long-term good and poor  outcomes is not clear. To analyze the functional connectivity difference between  patients in whom thalamotomy was effective and those in whom thalamotomy was  ineffective and its prognostic role in ET treatment, the authors evaluated  preoperative resting-state functional MRI in thalamotomy-treated patients.  METHODS: Preoperative resting-state functional MRI data in 85 patients with ET,  who were experiencing tremor relief at the time of treatment and were followed up  for a minimum of 6 months after the procedure, were collected for the study. The  authors conducted a graph independent component analysis of the functional  connectivity matrices of tremor-related networks. The patients were divided into  thalamotomy-effective and thalamotomy-ineffective groups (thalamotomy-effective  group, ≥ 50% motor symptom reduction; thalamotomy-ineffective group, < 50% motor  symptom reduction at 6 months after treatment) and the authors compared network  components between groups. RESULTS: Seventy-two (84.7%) of the 85 patients showed  ≥ 50% tremor reduction from baseline at 6 months after thalamotomy. The network  analysis shows significant suppression of functional network components with  connections between the areas of the cerebellum and the basal ganglia and  thalamus, but enhancement of those between the premotor cortex and supplementary  motor area in the noneffective group compared to the effective group.  CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that patients in the noneffective  group have suppressed functional subnetworks in the cerebellum and subcortex  regions and have enhanced functional subnetworks among motor-sensory cortical  networks compared to the thalamotomy-effective group. Therefore, the authors  suggest that the functional connectivity pattern might be a possible predictive  factor for outcomes of MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy.","2023-02-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","318-328","","2","138","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35901685","","","","*Essential Tremor/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Thalamus/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Treatment Outcome; Tremor; Ventral Thalamic Nuclei; brain network; essential tremor; functional neurosurgery; graph independent component analysis; prognosis; thalamotomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current treatment options for focal hand dystonia are limited, with  potentially more effective invasive stereotactic interventions, such as deep  brain stimulation or lesional therapies, rarely used. The advent of minimally  invasive brain lesioning provides a potentially safe and effective treatment  approach with a recent pilot study establishing MRgFUS Vo-complex thalamotomy as  an effective treatment option for focal hand dystonia. In this study, we  undertake an open-label clinical trial to further establish MRgFUS Vo-complex  thalamotomy as an effective treatment for focal hand dystonia with greater  attention paid to potential motor costs associated with this treatment. To  elucidate pathophysiology of dystonia and treatment mechanisms,  neurophysiological and MRI analysis will be performed longitudinally to explore  the hypothesis that neuroplastic and structural changes that may underlie this  treatment benefit. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A total of 10 participants will be  recruited into this open-label clinical trial. All participants will undergo  clinical, kinemetric, neurophysiological and radiological testing at baseline,  followed by repeated measures at predesignated time points post MRgFUS Vo-complex  thalamotomy. Further, to identify any underlying structural or neurophysiological  abnormalities present in individuals with focal hand dystonia, 10 age and gender  matched control participants will be recruited to undergo comparative  investigation. These results will be compared with the intervention participants  both at baseline and at 12 months to assess for normalisation of these  abnormalities, if present. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was reviewed and  approved by the St Vincent's Health Network Sydney Human Research Ethics  Committee (2022/ETH00778).

METHOD: A total of 123 patients were  enrolled in the injury group. In contrast, 246 patients without thermal injury  were assigned to the non-injury group. The relationship between patient and  treatment parameters and injury were explored using univariate analysis and  multiple logistic regression analyses. In addition, the factors influencing the  degree of thermal injury were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis H. RESULTS: (1)  Abdominal scars (p = .007, OR = 2.187, 95% CI: 1.242-3.849), abdominal wall  thickness (p < .001, OR = 1.042, 95% CI: 1.019-1.067), fundus fibroids (p = .038,  OR = 1.790, 95% CI: 1.033-3.100), UFs with hyperintense/mixed T2-weighted imaging  (T2WI) signals (p = .022, OR = 1.843, 95% CI: 1.091-3.115), average sonication  power (AP) (p = .025, OR = 1.021, 95% CI: 1.003-1.039), and treatment time (TT)  (p < .001, OR = 1.017, 95% CI: 1.011-1.023) were independent risk factors for  thermal injury, while treatment volume (TV) (p = .002, OR = 0.775, 95% CI:  0.661-0.909) was a protective factor for injury. (2) Four groups were subdivided  according to the degree of thermal injury(Group A: without skin injury. Group B:  with changed T2WI signal in the abdominal wall, Group C: mild skin injury, Group  D: severe skin injury), comparison of each with every other showed that the  abdominal wall in Groups A and D was thinner than Groups B and C, with  statistically significant differences (P(AB)<0.05, P(AC)<0.01, P(DC)<0.05,  P(DB)<0.05); Group A was slightly thicker than D, however, without statistical  difference. The ratio of sonication time (ST) to TV in Group A was the lowest of  all (P(AB), P(AC), P(AD) all < 0.05). And as the level of thermal injury rose,  the ratio gradually increased, however, without statistical difference.  CONCLUSIONS: Based on our limited results, the following conclusion was made. (1)  Abdominal scars, abdominal wall thickness, fundus fibroids, UFs with T2WI  hyperintense/mixed signals, AP and TT were independent risk factor. (2) Neither  too thick nor too thin abdominal walls would be recommended, as both might  increase the risk of skin injury. (3) Noticeably, the risk of skin injury might  increase considerably when the ST was longer and the sonication area was more  fixed.","2024","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2295232","","1","41","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 38159557","","","","*Abdominal Wall; *Burns/etiology; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/adverse effects/methods; *Leiomyoma/diagnostic imaging/surgery; *Uterine Neoplasms/surgery; Cicatrix/etiology; Female; Focused ultrasound ablation surgery; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; adverse effect; skin; thermal injury; uterine fibroid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Feedback is  collected throughout the procedure to verify the location of the target and  completeness of response; however, variability in clinical judgments may  underestimate or overestimate treatment response. OBJECTIVE: To objectively  quantify joint motion after each sonication using accelerometers secured to the  contralateral upper extremity in an effort to optimize MRgFUS treatment. METHODS:  Before the procedure, 3 accelerometers were secured to the patient's arm,  forearm, and index finger. Throughout the procedure, tremor motion was regularly  recorded during postural and kinetic tremor testing and individual joint angle  measures were modeled. The joint angle from each accelerometer was compared with  baseline measurements to assess changes in angles. Subsequent adjustments to the  target location and sonication energy were made at the discretion of the  neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist. RESULTS: Intraoperative accelerometer  measurements of hand tremor from 18 patients provided quantified data regarding  joint angle reduction: 87.3%, 94.2%, and 86.7% for signature writing, spiral  drawing, and line drawing tests, respectively. Target adjustment based on  accelerometer monitoring of the angle at each joint added substantial value  toward achieving optimal tremor reduction. CONCLUSION: Real-time accelerometer  recordings collected during MRgFUS thalamotomy offered objective quantification  of changes in joint angle after each sonication, and these findings were  consistent with clinical judgments of tremor response. These results suggest that  this technique could be used for fine adjustment of the location of sonication  energy and number of sonications to consistently achieve optimal tremor  reduction.","2023-06-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","641-650","","6","24","","Oper Neurosurg (Hagerstown)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2023.

Challenges with focused ablation in  rodent brains can include skull and near-field heating and accurately targeting  small and deep brain structures. We overcame these challenges by creating a novel  method consisting of a craniectomy skull preparation, a high-frequency transducer  (3 MHz) with a small ultrasound focal spot, a transducer positioning system with  an added manual adjustment of ∼0.1 mm targeting accuracy, and MR acoustic  radiation force imaging for confirmation of focal spot placement. METHODS: The  study consisted of two main parts. First, two skull preparation approaches were  compared. A skull thinning approach (n=7 lesions) was compared to a craniectomy  approach (n=22 lesions), which confirmed a craniectomy was necessary to decrease  skull and near-field heating. Second, the two transducer positioning systems were  compared with the fornix chosen as a subcortical ablation target. We evaluated  the accuracy of targeting using a high-frequency transducer with a small  ultrasound focal spot and MR acoustic radiation force imaging. RESULTS: Comparing  a motorized adjustment system (∼1 mm precision, n=17 lesions) to the motorized  system with an added micromanipulator (∼0.1 mm precision, n=14 lesions), we saw  an increase in the accuracy of targeting the fornix by 133%.

The standard method for gene delivery in  the brain involves invasive craniotomies that expose the brain and direct  injections of viruses that invariably damage neural tissue along the syringe  tract. A recently proposed alternative in which non-invasive optogenetics is  performed with focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB)  openings has been found to non-invasively facilitate gene delivery for  optogenetics in mice. Although gene delivery can be performed non-invasively,  validating successful viral transduction and expression of encoded ion channels  in target tissue typically involves similar invasive techniques, such as  craniotomies in longitudinal studies and/or postmortem histology. Functional  ultrasound imaging (fUSi) is an emerging neuroimaging technique that can be used  to transcranially detect changes in cerebral blood volume following introduction  of a stimulus. In this study, we implemented a fully non-invasive combined  FUS-fUSi technique for performing optogenetics in mice. FUS successfully  delivered viruses encoding the red-shifted channelrhodopsin variant ChrimsonR in  all treated subjects. fUSi successfully identified stimulus-evoked cerebral blood  volume changes preferentially in brain regions expressing the light-sensitive ion  channels. Improvements in cell-specific targeting of viral vectors and  transcranial ultrasound imaging will make the combined technique a useful tool  for neuroscience research in small animals.","2023-03","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","908-917","","3","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Beyond the mainstream therapeutic interventions  (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiotherapy), further  significant progresses in anticancer therapy could rely on the development of  novel treatment paradigms. To this end, one emerging approach consists in the use  of non-thermal low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) for conditioning cancer  molecules and/or cancer-targeted compounds, thereby leading to cancer cell death  with least side-effects. Cellular redox homeostasis manifested as the generation  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during energy metabolism as well as the  antioxidant capacity is interwoven to the composition, size and anatomical  location of the tumor masses. The higher content of ""oxide free radicals"" in  cancers makes them vulnerable to disruption of redox homeostasis than in the  healthy cells and therefore, one of the best options for preferentially  eradicating them is increasing their oxidative stress, excessively. A little is  known about the modulation of cellular redox homeostasis by LIFU, and so it will  be of great interest and utility to understand the effects of LIFU on the energy  metabolism of cancer cells. This review is intended to improve our knowledge on  the effect of LIFU on cancer cells with particular reference to its redox  metabolism for ultrasound-based therapies. Thereby, it could pave the way for  exploring novel methodologies and designing combined anti-cancer therapies,  especially, for faster and safer eradication of drug resistant and metastasizing  solid tumors.","2023-11-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","122040","","","332","","Life Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

The acoustic streaming behavior in brain tissue is difficult to model  numerically and thus warrants an in vitro examination of the effects of using  different sonication parameters, in terms of frequency, intensity, and pulse  duration (PD). METHODS: Melamine and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) foams were used to  mimic the porous brain tissue, which contains leptomeningeal fenestrations and  perivascular space, while agar hydrogel was used to emulate denser neuropil. FUS  was delivered to these media, which were immersed in a phosphate-buffered saline  containing toluidine blue O dye, across various frequencies (400, 500, and 600  kHz; applicable to transcranial delivery) in a pulsed mode at two different  spatialpeak pulse-average intensities (3 and 4 W/cm2). RESULTS: Image analysis  showed that the use of 400 kHz yielded the greatest dye infiltration in melamine  foam, while sonication had no impact on infiltration in the agar hydrogel due to  the dominance of diffusional transport. Using a fixed spatial-peak  temporal-average intensity of 0.4 W/cm2 at 400 kHz, a PD of 75 ms resulted in the  greatest infiltration depth in both melamine and PVA foams among the tested range  (50-150 ms). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the existence of a specific  frequency and PD that induce greater enhancement of solute/fluid movement, which  may contribute to eventual in vivo applications in promoting waste clearance from  the brain.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","35-46","","1","43","","Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Korea (South) PMID: 38029736  PMCID: PMC10766883","","","","Alzheimer’s disease; Bulk flow; Glymphatic; Phantom; Radiation force","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A few commercial systems have clinical approval for the  thermal ablation of solid tumors for the treatment of neurological diseases and  palliative pain management of bone metastases. However, the thermal effects of  FUS are known to lead to various biological effects, such as inhibition of repair  of DNA damage, reduction in tumor hypoxia, and induction of apoptosis. Here, we  studied radiosensitization as a combination therapy of FUS and RT in a xenograft  mouse model using newly developed MRI-compatible FUS equipment. Xenograft  tumor-bearing mice were produced by subcutaneous injection of the human prostate  cancer cell line PC-3. Animals were treated with FUS in 7 T MRI at 4.8 W/cm(2) to  reach ~45 °C and held for 30 min. The temperature was controlled via fiber optics  and proton resonance frequency shift (PRF) MR thermometry in parallel. In the  combination group, animals were treated with FUS followed by X-ray at a single  dose of 10 Gy. The effects of FUS and RT were assessed via hematoxylin-eosin  (H&E) staining. Tumor proliferation was detected by the immunohistochemistry of  Ki67 and apoptosis was measured by a TUNEL assay. At 40 days follow-up, the  impact of RT on cancer cells was significantly improved by FUS as demonstrated by  a reduction in cell nucleoli from 189 to 237 compared to RT alone. Inhibition of  tumor growth by 4.6 times was observed in vivo in the FUS + RT group (85.3%) in  contrast to the tumor volume of 393% in the untreated control. Our results  demonstrated the feasibility of combined MRI-guided FUS and RT for the treatment  of prostate cancer in a xenograft mouse model and may provide a chance for less  invasive cancer therapy through radiosensitization.","2023-02-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","3","12","","Cells","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36766824  PMCID: PMC9914251","","","","*Hyperthermia, Induced/methods; *Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/radiotherapy; Animals; Heterografts; Humans; MRgFUS; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Male; Mice; Temperature; cancer treatment; hyperthermia; magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound; prostate cancer cells; radiation therapy; radiosensitization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This retrospective study  recruited 57 patients aged 20-40 years with cervical HSIL combined with HR-HPV  infection who received FU treatment between September 2019 and April 2022.  Clinical data of the patients were obtained from hospital records. HSIL cure rate  and cumulative HR-HPV clearance rate were assessed after treatment. Patients were  followed up on fertility and pregnancy outcomes after treatment by telephone  interviews until April 1, 2023. RESULTS: During a 6-month follow-up, the HSIL  cure rate was 73.7%, and a statistical difference between CIN2 and CIN3 (75.6%  vs. 66.7%, p = 0.713) was not present. HSIL -recurrence was not observed during  the follow-up period, and the median follow-up duration was 12 months. The  cumulative HR-HPV clearance rates at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups were 56.1%  and 75.4%, respectively. The median clearance time of HR-HPV was 6 (95%  confidence interval, 5.46-6.54) months.

In terms of potential combinations, the use of  biocompatible magnetic nanoparticles as heat mediators has been extensively  investigated. Nevertheless, developing more efficient heat nanomediators that may  exhibit high specific absorption rates is still an unsolved problem. Our aim was  to investigate if externally applied magnetic fields and a heat-inducing NIR  affect tumor cell viability. To this end, under in vitro conditions, different  human cancer cells (A2058 melanoma, AsPC1 pancreas carcinoma, MDA-MB-231 breast  carcinoma) were treated with the combination of electromagnetic fields (EMFs,  using solenoids) and hyperthermia (HT, using a thermostated bath). The effect of  NIR was also studied in combination with standard chemotherapy and targeted  therapy. An experimental device combining EMFs and high-intensity focused  ultrasounds (HIFU)-induced HT was tested in vivo. EMFs (25 µT, 4 h) or HT (52 °C,  40 min) showed a limited effect on cancer cell viability in vitro. However, their  combination decreased viability to approximately 16%, 50%, and 21% of control  values in A2058, AsPC1, and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Increased lysosomal  permeability, release of cathepsins into the cytosol, and mitochondria-dependent  activation of cell death are the underlying mechanisms. Cancer cells could be  completely eliminated by combining EMFs, HT, and standard chemotherapy or EMFs,  HT, and anti-Hsp70-targeted therapy. As a proof of concept, in vivo experiments  performed in AsPC1 xenografts showed that a combination of EMFs, HIFU-induced HT,  standard chemotherapy, and a lysosomal permeabilizer induces a complete cancer  regression.","2023-06-29","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","13","15","","Cancers (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37444524  PMCID: PMC10340829","","","","cancer cell death; cancer therapy; electromagnetic fields; hyperthermia; non-ionizing radiations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CASES: We report two cases of tremor dominant PD who experienced tremor  recurrence following MRgFUS thalamotomy with subsequent successful subthalamic  nucleus deep brain stimulation (DBS). Tremor scores were measured at baseline, 1-  and 3-months post MRgFUS and at least 18 months post DBS in both patients. Both  cases evidenced immediate improvement in tremor, after MRgFUS, followed by  subsequent tremor recurrence. STN DBS resulted in almost complete long-term  tremor alleviation in both cases.

Current coupling methods are impractical for  clinical bedside use. Here, we evaluate commercially available high-viscosity gel  polymer matrices as couplants for human LIFU neuromodulation applications.  METHODS: We first empirically tested the acoustic transmission of three densities  at 500 kHz and then subjected the gel with the least acoustic attenuation to  further tests of the effect of thickness, frequency, de-gassing and production  variability. RESULTS: The highest-density gel had the lowest acoustic attenuation  (3.3%) with low lateral (<0.5 mm) and axial (<2 mm) beam distortion. Different  thicknesses of the gel up to 10 mm did not appreciably affect results. The gel  polymers exhibited frequency-dependent attenuation at 1 and 3 MHz up to 86.6%, as  well as significant beam distortion >4 mm. Poor de-gassing methods also increased  pressure attenuation at 500 kHz up to 59.6%. Standardized methods of making these  gels should be established to reduce variability.

The purpose is to  predict the need of additional treatment and failure after focal therapy using  high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for localized prostate cancer (PCa).  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 343 consecutive patients who underwent HIFU  with Ablatherm® and Focal One® devices between June 2001 and November 2020 were  identified. Treatment failure was defined as clinically significant PCa on  postoperative biopsy, the need for salvage radical or systematic treatment,  metastasis, or PCa-related death. The biochemical recurrence definitions tested  were PSA nadir, time to PSA nadir, percentage of PSA reduction, Huber et al.  criteria defined as PSA nadir + 1 ng/mL at 12 months or PSA nadir + 1.5 ng/mL at  24-36 months. Multivariable Cox regression analysis and decision-curve analysis  were used to validate and compare criteria. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to  assess criteria associated with the highest accuracy. RESULTS: One hundred  seventy-eight patients met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Overall, 61  (34%) and 41 (23%) patients had an additional treatment and failure with a median  follow-up of 52 months. At multivariable analysis, model including Huber et al.  criteria exhibited the highest Harrell's C-index for the prediction of the need  of additional treatment (hazard ratio [HR]: 10, p < 0.001, c-index: 84%) and  treatment failure (HR: 9.1, p < 0.001, c-index: 82%) as well as higher net  benefit.

BH uses sequences of 1-20 ms long pulses with shock fronts  of over 60 MPa amplitude, initiates boiling at the focus of the HIFU transducer  within each pulse, and the remainder shocks of the pulse then interact with the  boiling vapor cavities. One effect of this interaction is the creation of a  prefocal bubble cloud due to reflection of shocks from the initially generated  mm-sized cavities: the shocks are inverted when reflected from a pressure-release  cavity wall resulting in sufficient negative pressure to reach intrinsic  cavitation threshold in front of the cavity. Secondary clouds then form due to  shock-wave scattering from the first one. Formation of such prefocal bubble  clouds has been known as one of the mechanisms of tissue liquefaction in BH.  Here, a methodology is proposed to enlarge the axial dimension of this bubble  cloud by steering the HIFU focus toward the transducer after the initiation of  boiling until the end of each BH pulse and thus to accelerate treatment. A BH  system comprising a 1.5 MHz 256-element phased array connected to a Verasonics V1  system was used. High-speed photography of BH sonications in transparent gels was  performed to observe the extension of the bubble cloud resulting from shock  reflections and scattering. Volumetric BH lesions were then generated in ex vivo  tissue using the proposed approach. Results showed up to almost threefold  increase of the tissue ablation rate with axial focus steering during the BH  pulse delivery compared to standard BH.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","865-875","","8","70","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37318967  PMCID: PMC10671942","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; Sonication; Transducers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  objective of this study was to develop and test a deep learning-based method for  translation of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) into synthetic CE-T1w scans, for  monitoring MR-HIFU treatment progression. METHODS: The algorithm was  retrospectively trained and validated on data from 33 and 20 patients  respectively who underwent an MR-HIFU treatment of uterine fibroids between June  2017 and January 2019. Postablation synthetic CE-T1w images were generated by a  deep learning network trained on paired DWI and reference CE-T1w scans acquired  during the treatment procedure. Quantitative analysis included calculation of the  Dice coefficient of NPVs delineated on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans. Four  MR-HIFU radiologists assessed the outcome of MR-HIFU treatments and NPV ratio  based on the synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans. RESULTS: Dice coefficient of  NPVs was 71% (± 22%). The mean difference in NPV ratio was 1.4% (± 22%) and not  statistically significant (p = 0.79). Absolute agreement of the radiologists on  technical treatment success on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans was 83%. NPV  ratio estimations on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans were not significantly  different (p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning-based synthetic CE-T1w scans  derived from intraprocedural DWI allow gadolinium-free visualization of the  predicted NPV, and can potentially be used for repeated gadolinium-free  monitoring of treatment progression during MR-HIFU therapy for uterine fibroids.  KEY POINTS: • Synthetic CE-T1w scans can be derived from diffusion-weighted  imaging using deep learning. • Synthetic CE-T1w scans may be used for  visualization of the NPV without using a contrast agent directly after MR-HIFU  ablations of uterine fibroids.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","4178-4188","","6","33","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Low-intensity  focused ultrasound (LIFUS)-induced blood-brain barrier modulation has been  reported to promote neurogenesis. Although these studies have reported improved  behavioral performance and enhanced expression of brain biomarkers after LIFUS,  indicating increased neurogenesis, the precise mechanism remains unclear. In this  study, we evaluated eNSC activation as a mechanism for neurogenesis after  LIFUS-induced blood-brain barrier modulation. We evaluated the specific eNSC  markers, Sox-2 and nestin, to confirm the activation of eNSCs. We also performed  3'-deoxy-3'[(18)F] fluoro-L-thymidine positron emission tomography ([(18)F]  FLT-PET) to evaluate the activation of eNSCs. The expression of Sox-2 and nestin  was significantly upregulated 1 week after LIFUS. After 1 week, the upregulated  expression decreased sequentially; after 4 weeks, the upregulated expression  returned to that of the control group. [(18)F] FLT-PET images also showed higher  stem cell activity after 1 week. The results of this study indicated that LIFUS  could activate eNSCs and induce adult neurogenesis. These results show that LIFUS  may be useful as an effective treatment for patients with neurological damage or  neurological disorders in clinical settings.","2023-03-16","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","6","24","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36982785  PMCID: PMC10056062","","","","*Blood-Brain Barrier; *Neural Stem Cells; Brain; Humans; Nestin/genetics; Neurogenesis; Sox-2; endogenous neural stem cells; fluoro-L-thymidine; low-intensity focused ultrasound; nestin; neurogenesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It remains a challenge to prepare a functional siRNA complex, target  enough dose to the tumor, and stimulate its internalization into tumor cells and  its release to the cytoplasm. Here, we show how these key barriers to siRNA  delivery can be overcome with a complex─comprising siRNA, cationic lipids, and  pH-responsive peptides─that is suited to tumor uptake enhancement via focused  ultrasound (FUS). The complex provides effective nucleic acid encapsulation,  nuclease protection, and endosomal escape such that gene silencing in cells is  substantially more effective than that obtained with either equivalent lipoplexes  or commercial reagents. In mice bearing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts, both  lipid and ternary, lipid:peptide:siRNA complexes, prepared with near-infrared  fluorescently labeled siRNA, accumulate in tumors following FUS treatments.  Therefore, combining a well-designed lipid:peptide:siRNA complex with FUS tumor  treatments is a promising route to achieve robust in vivo gene delivery.","2023-05-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2341-2351","","5","20","","Mol Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36989421  PMCID: PMC10155207","","","","*Breast Neoplasms/genetics/therapy; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Humans; Lipids; Mice; Peptides; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering/genetics; RNAi; focused ultrasound; hyperthermia; liposomal siRNA delivery; ternary complex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS:  Twenty-two Korean adults with facial wrinkles and aging underwent treatment on  both sides of their face: HIFU-only on the left and HIFU combined with RF on the  right. Skin parameters were measured at different time points to evaluate the  improvement in skin rejuvenation. RESULTS: HIFU treatment significantly improved  skin parameters, including pore volume and number, skin elasticity, depth of eye  wrinkles, degree of sagging in the eye area, nasolabial folds and cheeks, volume  of the jawline, skin density, and permittivity. Furthermore, combining bipolar RF  with HIFU treatment enhanced efficacy in reducing pore number, improving skin  elasticity, diminishing eye wrinkle depth, and increasing skin moisturization.  These findings indicate that bipolar RF can synergically improve skin  rejuvenation by providing a thermal effect to the upper papillary dermis, which  is more superficial than the target area of HIFU.

METHODS: A total of 142 patients  with 172 hysteromyomas (95 hysteromyomas from the sufficient ablation group, and  77 hysteromyomas from the insufficient ablation group) were enrolled in the  study. The clinical-radiological model was constructed with independent  clinical-radiological risk factors, the radiomics model was constructed based on  the optimal radiomics features of hysteromyoma from dual sequences, and the two  groups of features were incorporated to construct the combined model. A fivefold  cross validation procedure was adopted to validate these models. A nomogram was  constructed, applying the combined model in the training cohort. The models were  assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and integrated  discrimination improvement (IDI). An independent test cohort comprising 40  patients was used to evaluate the performance of the optimal model. RESULTS:  Among the three models, the average areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of the  radiomics model and combined model were 0.803 (95% confidence interval (CI):  0.726-0.881) and 0.841 (95% CI: 0.772-0.909), which were better than the  clinical-radiological model in the training cohort. The IDI showed that the  combined model had the best prediction accuracy.

CT imaging is used to  estimate the acoustic properties that vary between individual skulls to enable  effective focusing during tFUS procedures, exposing patients to potentially  harmful radiation. A method to estimate acoustic parameters in the skull without  the need for CT is desirable. APPROACH: We synthesized CT images from routinely  acquired T1-weighted MRI using a 3D patch-based conditional generative  adversarial network and evaluated the performance of synthesized CT (sCT) images  for treatment planning with tFUS. We compared the performance of sCT with real CT  (rCT) images for tFUS planning using Kranion and simulations using the acoustic  toolbox, k-Wave. Simulations were performed for 3 tFUS scenarios: (1) no  aberration correction, (2) correction with phases calculated from Kranion, and  (3) phase shifts calculated from time reversal. RESULTS: From Kranion, the skull  density ratio, skull thickness, and number of active elements between rCT and sCT  had Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.94, 0.92, and 0.98, respectively.  Among 20 targets, differences in simulated peak pressure between rCT and sCT were  largest without phase correction (12.4%±8.1%) and smallest with Kranion phases  (7.3%±6.0%). The distance between peak focal locations between rCT and sCT was  < 1.3  mm for all simulation cases. CONCLUSIONS: Real and synthetically  generated skulls had comparable image similarity, skull measurements, and  acoustic simulation metrics.

Histopathological alterations, dynamics of tumor cell  apoptosis and proliferation, expression levels of VEGF, MMP-9, IL-2R, TGF-β1,  HSP-70, IL-6, IL-8, and INF-γ, and the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)  were evaluated post-HIFU incomplete ablation. RESULTS: For HIFU 80% ablation  group, there was an 85.85% reduction in tumor volume 21 days post-intervention. A  marked increase in tumor cell apoptosis and a concomitant decrease in  proliferation were observed. Notably, distant tumor metastasis rates, CTC counts,  and expression levels of VEGF, MMP-9, IL-2R, TGF-β1, IL-6, and IL-8 were  significantly reduced. In contrast, INF-γ and HSP-70 expressions were notably  elevated, aligning with findings from the 100% ablation group. CONCLUSIONS: HIFU  incomplete ablation, with an 80% tumor ablation rate, induces substantial tumor  damage, augments tumor cell apoptosis, and triggers an anti-tumor immune  response, curtailing metastasis. These insights may underpin further  investigations into the therapeutic implications of HIFU incomplete ablation.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2255760","","1","40","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37726101","","","","*Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; *Neoplasms; Animals; HIFU incomplete ablation; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Interleukin-6; Interleukin-8; Prognosis; Rabbits; Transforming Growth Factor beta1; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; anti-tumor immune; apoptosis; breast cancer; metastasis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focused ultrasound can deliver acoustic energy to local regions of the brain, including deep brain  structures. In addition, it is possible to induce the activation or inhibition of  nerves through parameter adjustments of focused ultrasound. Laser-generated  focused ultrasound (LGFUS) has demonstrated a potential use in precise  therapeutic ultrasound applications owing to the ability to produce  high-pressure, broadband frequency of shock waves with a tight focal spot,  resulting in confined acoustic exposure of a small area. However, there have been  few studies of neurostimulation using shock waves with pulse durations of several  nanoseconds. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of  neurostimulation by shock waves generated from a focused Carbon Nanotube (fCNT)  transducer. We measured electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in three rat brains  before and after shock wave stimulation and compared them in the time and  frequency domains. In the time domain, the number of peaks of EEG signals was  measured significantly higher after shock wave stimulation than before  stimulation in all three rats. The three rats showed differences in three  frequency bands: theta(4-7 Hz), alpha(8-12), and 1-30 Hz, before and after shock  wave stimulation (p < 0.001). These differences in EEG signals after shock wave  stimulation of three rats were confirmed mainly because of shock waves. The  stimulation of a rat brain was feasible using shock waves generated by the fCNT  transducer. This study provides a basis for the applications of shock waves to  brain stimulation for precise targeting.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","398-405","","","31","","IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36423309","","","","*Nanotubes, Carbon; Animals; Brain; Electroencephalography; Lasers; Rats; Transducers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, synergists are crucial to the therapy process  due to the ultrasonic energy's attenuation properties. As a result of the complex  hypoxic environment in the tumor area and many factors, the existing synergists  have limitations such as weak targeting, single imaging mode, and easy tumor  recurrence after treatment. Because of the above deficiencies, this study intends  to construct bio-targeted oxygen production probes consisting of Bifidobacterium  that naturally target the hypoxia region of the tumor and multi-functional  oxygen-producing nanoparticles equipped with IR780, perfluorohexane (PFH), CBP  (carboplatin), and oxygen. The probes are expected to achieve targeted and  synergistic FUAS therapy and dual-mode imaging to mediate tumor diagnosis and  treatment. The oxygen and drugs carried in it are accurately released after FUAS  stimulation, which is expected to alleviate tumor hypoxia, avoid tumor drug  resistance, improve the effect of chemotherapy, and realize FUAS combined with  chemotherapy antitumor therapy. This strategy is expected to make up for the  deficiencies of existing synergists, improve the effectiveness and safety of  treatment, and provide the foundation for future tumor therapy progress.","2023-04-29","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","142","","1","21","","J Nanobiotechnology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

This study explores the use of a recently developed focused  ultrasound extraction (FUSE) technique to enable the rapid release of DNA from  plant tissues for genetic analysis. METHODS: FUSE generates a dense acoustic  cavitation bubble cloud that pulverizes targeted tissue into acellular debris.  This technique was applied to leaf samples of American chestnut (Castanea  dentata), tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), red maple (Acer rubrum), and  chestnut oak (Quercus montana). RESULTS: We observed that FUSE can extract high  quantities of DNA in 9-15 min, compared to the 30 min required for control DNA  extraction methods. FUSE extracted DNA quantities of 24.33 ± 6.51 ng/mg and  35.32 ± 9.21 ng/mg from American chestnut and red maple, respectively, while  control methods yielded 6.22 ± 0.87 ng/mg and 11.51 ± 1.95 ng/mg, respectively.  The quality of the DNA released by FUSE allowed for successful amplification and  next-generation sequencing. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that FUSE can  improve DNA extraction efficiency for leaf tissues. Continued development of this  technology aims to adapt to field-deployable systems to increase the cataloging  of genetic biodiversity, particularly in low-resource biodiversity hotspots.","2023-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e11510","","1","11","","Appl Plant Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

APPROACH: In this study, a tight-fitting helmet-shape  receive array with a single transmit loop for anesthetized macaque brain MRI at  7T was fabricated with four openings constructed in the coil housing to  accommodate multimodal devices, and the coil performance was quantitatively  evaluated and compared to a commercial knee coil. In addition, experiments over  three macaques with infrared neural stimulation (INS), focused ultrasound  stimulation (FUS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) were  conducted. MAIN RESULTS: The RF coil showed higher transmit efficiency,  comparable homogeneity, improved SNR and enlarged signal coverage over the  macaque brain. Infrared neural stimulation was applied to the amygdala in deep  brain region, and activations in stimulation sites and connected sites were  detected, with the connectivity consistent with anatomical information. Focused  ultrasound stimulation was applied to the left visual cortex, and activations  were acquired along the ultrasound traveling path, with all time course curves  consistent with pre-designed paradigms. The existence of transcranial direct  current stimulation electrodes brought no interference to the RF system, as  evidenced through high-resolution MPRAGE structure images.

This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of high-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) on E. faecalis biofilms in  artificially infected root canals for the potential application in current  endodontic practices. METHODS: Forty-five single-rooted extracted teeth were  instrumented using hand files, sterilized in an autoclave, infected with E.  faecalis and incubated for 4 wk. The specimens were treated and identified as  follows: Control, 4% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl); riboflavin (1 mg/mL); light  only; HIFU (250 kHz, 20 W, 60s); PDT; riboflavin/HIFU; light/HIFU; and  riboflavin/HIFU/light. Bactericidal efficacy was determined by colony-forming  units (CFU), (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide)  (MTT) assay, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning  microscopy (CLSM). RESULTS: Enterococcus faecalis biofilm exhibited significantly  lower metabolic activity when treated with HIFU (250 kHz, 20 W, 60 s) compared  with the control (4% NaOCl) and PDT groups. A similar phenomenon was observed  with the CFU assay. HIFU remained the most effective treatment modality, with  consistent results in CLSM and SEM. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the  potential application of HIFU as an adjunct drug-free, non-destructive root canal  disinfection method for endodontic treatment, suggesting an alternative to the  current gold standard of 4% NaOCl and PDT.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1875-1881","","8","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

To address this issue, we developed a new mouse model, the  double transgenic Pou4f3(+/DTR) × Thy1-GCaMP6s, which allows for inducible  deafening using diphtheria toxin and minimizes off-target effects of UNM while  allowing effects on neural activity to be visualized with fluorescent calcium  imaging.

At higher  pressures, FUS can result in focal fluorescence dips at the target, elicit  non-auditory sensory confounds, and damage tissue, leading to spreading  depolarization. Under the acoustic conditions we tested, we did not observe  direct calcium responses in the mouse cortex.

However, it is indefinite  whether to combine endoscopic resection and uncertain to say who the ideal  candidates are for the combined treatment. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a  meta-analysis to compare outcomes of sole HIFU therapy with that of HIFU in  combination with endoscopic resection in patients with localized PCa. MATERIALS  AND METHODS: Electronic databases were searched following the PRISMA guidelines  and PICOS formats. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) studies on HIFU for  PCa patients; 2) comparative studies on HIFU in combination with endoscopic  resection for localized PCa men. Exclusion criteria include non-comparative  studies and salvage HIFU therapy. Meta-analysis results were mainly present using  forest plots. Sensitivity analysis and Egger's test were adopted to determine the  stability and assess the publication bias. RESULTS: Six comparative studies with  767 patients were eligible, including 487 cases in the combination therapy group  and 280 cases in the monotherapy group. There was no statistical difference in  age, preoperative PSA levels, and prostate volume between two groups. No  statistical difference was found in postoperative PSA nadir (MD = -0.02, 95%CI:  -0.35 to 0.31, P = 0.90), disease-free survival rate (RR = 0.95, 95%CI: 0.83 to  1.09, P = 0.47), and preoperative IPSS score (MD = -0.69, 95%CI: -1.63 to 0.26, P  = 0.15; I2 = 8%) between two groups. The combination therapy group had  significantly lower postoperative IPSS score (MD = -5.49, 95%CI: -6.47 to -4.51,  P < 0.001) and shorter catheterization time (MD=-13.70, 95%CI: -19.24 to -8.16, P  < 0.001) than the monotherapy group. The rates of urinary incontinence (7.4% vs.  13.9%, RR = 0.45, 95%CI: 0.29 to 0.70, P = 0.0004; I2=4%), acute urinary  retention (6.8% vs. 10.5%, RR=0.36, 95%CI: 0.14 to 0.89, P = 0.03; I2 = 0%),  urinary tract infection (10% vs. 33%, RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.4, P < 0.001;  I2 = 0%), epididymitis (1.2% vs. 15.7%, RR=0.11, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.59, P = 0.01;  I2 = 0%), and urethral stricture (7.1% vs. 23.2%, RR = 0.3, 95%CI: 0.18 to 0.51,  P < 0.001; I2 = 0%) in the combination therapy group were all significantly lower  than that in the monotherapy group.

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic  Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was used to guide literature  selection. The inclusion criteria were the following: (I) the patients were  diagnosed with aggressive fibromatosis pathologically, (II) the patients were  treated by thermal ablations, and (III) a focus on treatment efficacy and safety.  Meanwhile, the exclusion criteria were the following: (I) cohorts of patients  with hypertrophic scar, Gardner fibroma, or nodular fasciitis; (II) conference  abstracts, reviews, case reports, letters to editors, comments, or editorials;  (III) number of patients <5; (IV) in vitro or animal experiments; and (V)  non-English language articles. The inverse variance method with a random effects  model was used to obtain the pooled data. Subgroup analyses were performed to  identify treatment factors. Egger test was conducted to assess the risk of  publication bias. RESULTS: After literature selection, 694 DF tumors were  identified in 23 studies. In terms of modality, 13 studies used cryoablation, 9  studies used high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), and 1 study used microwave  ablation (MWA). The pooled symptom relief rate was 90% [95% confidence interval  (CI): 80-97%], with that for HIFU being 100% (95% CI: 85-100%), that for  cryoablation being 87% (95% CI: 74-97%), and that MWA being 89% (95% CI).

Combined with MR-ARFI (acoustic  radiation force imaging) and using fMRI BOLD signal as functional readouts, our  previous studies have shown that low-intensity FUS can excite or suppress neural  activity in the somatosensory cortex. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether  low-intensity FUS can suppress nociceptive heat stimulation-induced responses in  thalamic nuclei during hand stimulation, and to determine how this suppression  influences the information processing flow within nociception networks. FINDINGS:  BOLD fMRI activations evoked by 47.5 °C heat stimulation of hand were detected in  24 cortical regions, which belong to sensory, affective, and cognitive  nociceptive networks. Concurrent delivery of low-intensity FUS pulses (650 kHz,  550 kPa) to the predefined heat nociceptive stimulus-responsive thalamic  centromedial_parafascicular (CM_para), mediodorsal (MD), ventral_lateral (VL_ and  ventral_lateral_posteroventral (VLpv) nuclei suppressed their heat responses.  Off-target cortical areas exhibited reduced, enhanced, or no significant fMRI  signal changes, depending on the specific areas. Differentiable thalamocortical  information flow during the processing of nociceptive heat input was observed, as  indicated by the time to reach 10% or 30% of the heat-evoked BOLD signal peak.  Suppression of thalamic heat responses significantly altered nociceptive  processing flow and direction between the thalamus and cortical areas. Modulation  of contralateral versus ipsilateral areas by unilateral thalamic activity  differed. Signals detected in high-order cortical areas, such as dorsal frontal  (DFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal (vlPFC) cortices, exhibited faster response  latencies than sensory areas. CONCLUSIONS: The concurrent delivery of FUS  suppressed nociceptive heat response in thalamic nuclei and disrupted the  nociceptive network. This study offers new insights into the causal functional  connections within the thalamocortical networks and demonstrates the modulatory  effects of low-intensity FUS on nociceptive information processing.","2023-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1430-1444","","5","16","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

To address this issue, we developed a new mouse model, the  double transgenic Pou4f3+/DTR × Thy1-GCaMP6s, which allows for inducible  deafening using diphtheria toxin and minimizes off-target effects of UNM while  allowing effects on neural activity to be visualized with fluorescent calcium  imaging. Using this model, we found that the auditory confounds caused by FUS can  be significantly reduced or eliminated within a certain pressure range. At higher  pressures, FUS can result in focal fluorescence dips at the target, elicit  non-auditory sensory confounds, and damage tissue, leading to spreading  depolarization. Under the acoustic conditions we tested, we did not observe  direct calcium responses in the mouse cortex. Our findings provide a cleaner  animal model for UNM and sonogenetics research, establish a parameter range  within which off-target effects are confidently avoided, and reveal the  non-auditory side effects of higher-pressure stimulation.","2023-05-24","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: bioRxiv Pages: 2023.05.22.541780 Publication Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology PMID: 37293117  PMCID: PMC10245917","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PWS is typically treated by using lasers to destroy  abnormal blood vessels. The laser heating facilitates selective photothermolysis  of the vessels and attenuates quickly in the tissue due to high optical  scattering. Therefore, residual abnormal capillaries deep in the tissue survive  and often lead to the resurgence of PWS. Ultrasound (US) has also been proposed  to treat PWS, however, it is nonselective with respect to the vasculature but  penetrates deeper into the tissue. We aim to study the feasibility of a hybrid  PWS treatment modality combining the advantages of both modalities. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: In this manuscript, we propose a photoacoustic (PA) guided US focusing  methodology for PWS treatment which combines the optical contrast-based  selectivity with US penetration to focus the US energy onto the vasculature. The  PA signals collected by the transducers, when time-reversed, amplified, and  transmitted, converge onto the PWS, thus minimally affecting the neighboring  tissue. We performed two- and three-dimensional simulations that mimic realistic  transducers and medium properties in this proof of concept study. RESULTS: The  time-reversed PA signals when transmitted from the transducers converged onto the  vasculature, as expected, thus reducing the heating of the neighboring tissue. We  observed that while the US focus is indeed affected due to experimental factors  such as limited-view, large detector separation and finite detection bandwidth,  and so forth, the US did focus completely or partially onto the vasculature  demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed methodology. CONCLUSION: The  results demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology for PWS treatment.  This treatment method can destroy the deeper capillaries while minimally heating  the neighboring tissue, thus reducing the chances of the resurgence of PWS and as  well as cosmetic scarring.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","46-60","","1","55","","Lasers Surg Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36208102  PMCID: PMC9892359","","","","*Port-Wine Stain/diagnostic imaging/therapy; Cicatrix; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Lasers; Spectrum Analysis; high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU); photoacoustic (PA)-guided ultrasound (US); photoacoustics (PA); port wine stain (PWS); time-reversal (TR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total of 299 patients with adenomyosis who underwent USgHIFU ablation  were enrolled. Quantitative signal intensity (SI) analysis was performed on T2WI  and dynamic enhancement type. The energy efficiency factor (EEF) was defined as  the ultrasound energy delivered for ablating 1 mm(3) of tissue. NPVR ≥ 50% was  used as the criterion for technical success. Adverse effects and complications  were recorded. Logistic regression analyses of variables were conducted to  identify the factors affecting NPVR ≥ 50%. RESULTS: The median NPVR was 53.5%  (34.7%). There were 159 cases in the NPVR ≥ 50% group and 140 cases in the NPVR <  50% group. The EEF in NPVR < 50.0% group was significantly higher than that in  NPVR ≥ 50% group (p < 0.05). The incidence of intraoperative adverse effects and  postoperative adverse events in the NPVR < 50% group were higher than those in  the NPVR ≥ 50% group (p < 0.05 for both). Logistic regression analysis showed  that abdominal wall thickness, SI difference on T2WI between adenomyosis and  rectus abdominis, and enhancement type on T1WI were protective factors for NPVR ≥  50% (p < 0.05), while the history of childbirth was an independent risk factor  (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with NPVR < 50%, NPVR ≥ 50% did not increase  the intraprocedural and postprocedural adverse reactions.

Surgical treatment has several disadvantages, including visible scarring.  High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a recent noninvasive treatment for  thyroid nodules. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety  of HIFU for the treatment of benign thyroid nodules. METHODS: We searched PubMed,  Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies evaluating the outcomes of HIFU for  patients with benign thyroid nodules. We conducted a meta-analysis by using a  random effects model and evaluated the volume reduction ratio, treatment success  rate, and incidence of treatment-related complications. RESULTS: Thirty-two  studies were included in the systematic review. Only 14 studies were used in the  meta-analysis because the other 18 involved data collected during overlapping  periods. The average volume reduction ratios at 3, 6, and 12 months after  treatment were 39.02% (95% CI: 27.57 to 50.47%, I(2): 97.9%), 48.55% (95% CI:  35.53 to 61.57%, I(2): 98.2%), and 55.02% (95% CI: 41.55 to 68.48%, I(2): 99%),  respectively. Regarding complications, the incidences of vocal cord paresis and  Horner's syndrome after HIFU were 2.1% (95% CI: 0.2 to 4.1%, I(2): 14.6%) and  0.7% (95% CI: 0 to 1.9%, I(2): 0%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HIFU is an  effective and safe treatment option for patients with benign thyroid nodules.  However, the effects of HIFU on nodules of large sizes and with different  properties require further investigation. Additional studies, particularly  randomized controlled trials involving long-term follow-up, are warranted.  CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Surgical treatment for thyroid nodules often  results in permanent visible scars and is associated with a risk of bleeding,  nerve injury, and hypothyroidism. High-intensity focused ultrasound may be an  alternative for patients with benign thyroid nodules. KEY POINTS: • The success  rate of HIFU treatment for thyroid nodules is 75.8% at 6 months. Average volume  reduction ratios are 48.55% and 55.02% at 6 and 12 months. • The incidence of  complications such as vocal fold paresis, Horner's syndrome, recurrent laryngeal  nerve palsy, hypothyroidism, and skin redness is low. • HIFU is both effective  and safe as a treatment for benign thyroid nodules.","2023-10-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

SDT is a non-invasive approach utilising focused ultrasound to  activate photosensitisers like 5-ALA to impede tumour growth. Unfortunately, the  molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic functions of SDT remain  enigmatic. This is primarily due to the lack of intricately optimised  instrumentation capable of modulating SDT delivery to glioma cells in vitro.  Consequently, very little information is available on the effects of SDT on  glioma stem cells which are key drivers of gliomagenesis and recurrence. To  address this, the current study has developed and validated an automated in vitro  SDT system to allow the application and mapping of focused ultrasound fields  under varied exposure conditions and setup configurations. The study optimizes  ultrasound frequency, intensity, plate base material, thermal effect, and the  integration of live cells. Indeed, in the presence of 5-ALA, focused ultrasound  induces apoptotic cell death in primary patient-derived glioma cells with  concurrent upregulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Intriguingly,  primary glioma stem neurospheres also exhibit remarkably reduced 3D growth upon  SDT exposure. Taken together, the study reports an in vitro system for SDT  applications on tissue culture-based disease models to potentially benchmark the  novel approach to the current standard-of-care.","2023-11-18","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","20215","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

High-intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU) is effective in destroying target tumor tissues without  damaging the path of the ultrasound beam and surrounding normal tissues. The  levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LN-IUS) is a medical system which  is inserted into the uterine to provide medicinal treatment for temporary control  of the symptoms caused by adenomyosis. This study was to investigate the effect  of HIFU combined with the LN-IUS on adenomyosis. In the HIFU treatment, the  parameters of the ultrasound were transmission frequency 0.8 MHz and input power  50-400 W (350 ± 30), and the temperature in the target tissue under these  conditions would reach 60-100 °C (85 °C ± 6.3 °C). Size reduction and blood flow  signal decrease were used to assess the effect of combined treatment. In this  study, 131 patients with adenomyosis treated with HIFU combined with LN-IUS were  retrospectively enrolled. The clinical and follow-up data were analyzed. After  treatment, the volume of the uterine lesion was significantly decreased with an  effective rate of 72.1%, and the adenomyosis blood flow signals were  significantly reduced, with an effective rate of 71.3%. At six months, the  menstrual cycle was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased from 31.4 ± 3.5 days  before treatment to 28.6 ± 1.9 days, the menstrual period was significantly  shortened from 7.9 ± 1.2 days before HIFU to 6.5 ± 1.3 days, and the menstrual  volume was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased from 100 to 49% ± 13%. The serum  hemoglobin significantly (P < 0.05) increased from 90.8 ± 6.2 g/L before  treatment to 121.6 ± 10.8 g/L at six months for patients with anemia. Among  seventy-two (92.3%) patients who finished the six-month follow-up, sixty-five  (90.3%) patients had the dysmenorrhea completely relieved, and the other seven  (9.7%) patients had only slight dysmenorrhea which did not affect their daily  life. Adverse events occurred in 24 (18.3%) patients without causing severe  consequences, including skin burns in two (1.5%) patients, skin swelling in four  (3.1%), mild lower abdominal pain and low fever in 15 (11.5%), and subcutaneous  induration in three (2.3%). Six months after treatment, no other serious side  effects occurred in any patients with follow-up. In conclusions, the use of  high-intensity focused ultrasound combined with the levonorgestrel-releasing  intrauterine system for the treatment of adenomyosis is safe and effective even  though the long-term effect remains to be confirmed.","2023-06-19","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","9903","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Still, its fixed focal point requires an array ultrasound transducer or scanning  system to cover different therapeutic scenarios. To address this limitation, we  developed an electrically-controlled liquid lens that enables dynamic beam  focusing and steering of the incident plane ultrasound beam. The lens was  carefully optimized for low-energy attenuation and low-voltage driving. We  evaluated the performance of the lens using a homemade 5.5-MHz planar transducer  with a 7.5-mm aperture. Our results demonstrate that the planar ultrasound beam  can be adjusted to a focused beam with a focal length from 27 mm to 32 mm within  1 s by increasing the electric input (0-60 V) to the lens. Additionally, the beam  angle of the ultrasound is tunable from -5 to 5° by adjusting the charge  distribution on the lens. Our design enables real-time, fast-response, on-demand  changing of focal length and beam angle for a single-element planar transducer.

The immunosuppressive tumor-immune microenvironment  (TIME) remains a major obstacle in melanoma therapy. Adjuvant treatment  modalities that enhance anti-tumor immune cell function are associated with  improved patient response. One potential mechanism to stimulate the anti-tumor  immune response is by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) in tumors. ICD leads  to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns within the TIME,  subsequently promoting antigen presentation and anti-tumor immunity. This review  summarizes relevant concepts and mechanisms underlying ICD and introduces the  potential of non-ablative low-intensity focused ultrasound (LOFU) as an  immune-priming therapy that can be combined with ICD-inducing focal ablative  therapies to promote an anti-melanoma immune response.","2023-08-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","8","11","","Biomedicines","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37626741  PMCID: PMC10452223","","","","anti-tumor immune response; damage-associated molecular patterns; focused ultrasound; immunogenic cell death; melanoma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior work has shown that pre-heating  tendons increases susceptibility to histotripsy fractionation; combining multiple  driving frequencies may also allow successful fractionation of tendons. Here, we  evaluate single- and dual-frequency histotripsy in four healthy and eight  tendinopathic ex vivo bovine tendons. First, we evaluated single-frequency (1.07,  1.5, and 3.68 MHz) and dual-frequency (1.07 and 1.5 MHz or 1.5 and 3.68 MHz)  bubble dynamics with high-speed photography in a tissue-mimicking phantom. Then,  tendons were treated with histotripsy. Cavitation activity was monitored with a  passive cavitation detector (PCD) and targeted areas were evaluated grossly and  histologically. Results in tendinopathic tendons showed 1.5 MHz or 3.68 MHz  single-frequency exposure caused focal disruption, whereas 1.5 and 3.68 MHz  dual-frequency exposures caused fractionated holes; all treatments caused some  thermal denaturation. Exposure to 1.07 MHz alone or combined with 1.5 MHz did not  show fractionation in tendinopathic tendons. In healthy tendons, only thermal  necrosis was observed for all tested exposures. PCD showed some differences in  cavitation activity in tendinopathic tendons but did not predict successful  fractionation.

Capacitive  micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs) may provide an alternative to  existing piezoelectric technologies by exhibiting advanced integration capability  through miniaturization, broad frequency bandwidth, and potential for high  electroacoustic efficiency. An endocavitary dual-mode USgHIFU probe was built to  investigate the potential of using CMUT technologies for transrectal prostate  cancer ablative therapy. The USgHIFU probe included a planar 64-element annular  high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) CMUT array ( [Formula: see text] = 3  MHz) surrounding a 256-element linear imaging CMUT array. Acoustic  characterization of the HIFU array included 3-D pressure field mapping and  radiation force balance measurements. Ex vivo proof-of-concept experiments  consisted in generating HIFU thermal ablations with the CMUT probe on porcine  liver tissues. The planar CMUT probe enabled HIFU dynamic focusing (distance  range: 32-72 mm) while providing acoustic surface intensities of 1 W/cm2 that  allowed producing elementary ex vivo ablations in depth of liver tissue ( L ×W ≈  10×5 mm). Combinations of dynamic focusing, along with probe rotation and  translation produced larger thermal ablations ( L ×W ≈ 20×20 mm) by juxtaposing  multiple elementary ablations, consistent with expected results obtained through  numerical modeling. The technical feasibility of using a USgHIFU probe, fully  developed using CMUTs for tissue ablation purposes, was demonstrated. The  HIFU-CMUT array showed tissue ablation capabilities with volumes compatible with  localized cancer targeting, thus providing assets for further development of  focal therapies.","2023-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1470-1481","","11","70","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37540608","","","","*Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; Animals; Equipment Design; Liver/diagnostic imaging/surgery; Male; Swine; Transducers; Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Post-HIFU MRIs of 110 consecutive patients who  underwent follow-up biopsies between August 2019 and April 2021 were  retrospectively analyzed and the likelihood of recurrence was assessed on a  five-point Likert scale by two board-certified uroradiologists. Diagnostic  performance of the Likert scale assigned to the post-HIFU MRI was assessed using  the follow-up biopsy results as a reference standard. Among the clinical and  radiological variables, predictors of the recurrence were examined through  logistic regression. RESULTS: In per-patient and per-sector analyses, Likert  scale on post-HIFU MRI showed a sensitivity and specificity of 0.37 and 0.97, and  0.42 and 0.87, respectively, in predicting recurrence. Two patients with high  suspicion on MRI required additional treatment to regain biochemical control  despite negative biopsies. High suspicion on post-HIFU MRI (odds ratio = 1.74;  p < 0.01), and more cancer-positive cores on initial biopsy (odds ratio = 1.25;  p = 0.03) were independent predictors of recurrence. CONCLUSION: Albeit with low  sensitivity, high suspicion on post-HIFU MRI may be clinically important because  of its high specificity, especially when considering the possibility of sampling  error in biopsies. Patients with a high number of cancer-positive cores at  diagnosis should avoid HIFU as they have an increased risk of recurrence.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","360-366","","2","26","","Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

PATIENTS AND  METHODS: Patients with biopsy-confirmed ≤T3bN0M0 cancer after previous external  beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy were included from the FOcal RECurrent  Assessment and Salvage Treatment (FORECAST) trial (NCT01883128; 2014-2018; six  centres), and from the high-intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) Evaluation and  Assessment of Treatment (HEAT) and International Cryotherapy Evaluation (ICE)  UK-based registries (2006-2022; nine centres). Eligible patients underwent either  salvage focal HIFU or cryotherapy, with the choice based predominantly on  anatomical factors. Per the original multivariable Cox regression model, the  predicted outcome was a composite failure outcome. Model performance was assessed  at 2 years post-salvage with discrimination (concordance index [C-index]),  calibration (calibration curve and slope), and decision curve analysis. For the  latter, two clinically-reasonable risk threshold ranges of 0.14-0.52 and  0.26-0.36 were considered, corresponding to previously published pooled 2-year  recurrence-free survival rates for salvage local treatments. RESULTS: A total of  168 patients were included, of whom 84/168 (50%) experienced the primary outcome  in all follow-ups, and 72/168 (43%) within 2 years. The C-index was 0.65 (95%  confidence interval 0.58-0.71). On graphical inspection, there was close  agreement between predicted and observed failure. The calibration slope was 1.01.  In decision curve analysis, there was incremental net benefit vs a 'treat all'  strategy at risk thresholds of ≥0.23. The net benefit was therefore higher across  the majority of the 0.14-0.52 risk threshold range, and all of the 0.26-0.36  range. CONCLUSION: In external validation using prospective, multicentre data,  this model demonstrated modest discrimination but good calibration and clinical  utility for predicting failure of salvage focal ablation within 2 years. This  model could be reasonably used to improve selection of appropriate treatment  candidates for salvage focal ablation, and its use should be considered when  discussing salvage options with patients. Further validation in larger,  international cohorts with longer follow-up is recommended.","2023-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","520-530","","5","132","","BJU Int","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

Although it has  superior sensitivity and utilizes low-cost instrumentation, the highly scattering  nature of bio-tissue makes FT in thick samples challenging, resulting in poor  resolution and low quantitative accuracy. To overcome the limitations of FT, we  previously introduced a novel method, termed temperature modulated fluorescence  tomography (TMFT), which is based on two key elements: (1) temperature-sensitive  fluorescent agents (ThermoDots) and (2) high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).  The fluorescence emission of ThermoDots increases up to hundredfold with only  several degree temperature elevation. The exceptional and reversible response of  these ThermoDots enables their modulation, which effectively allows their  localization using the HIFU. Their localization is then used as functional a  priori during the FT image reconstruction process to resolve their distribution  with higher spatial resolution. The last version of the TMFT system was based on  a cooled CCD camera utilizing a step-and-shoot mode, which necessitated long  total imaging time only for a small selected region of interest (ROI). In this  paper, we present the latest version of our TMFT technology, which uses a much  faster continuous HIFU scanning mode based on an intensified CCD (ICCD) camera.  This new, to the best of our knowledge, version can capture the whole  field-of-view (FOV) of 50×30m m (2) at once and reduces the total imaging time  down to 30 min, while preserving the same high resolution (∼1.3m m) and superior  quantitative accuracy (<7% error) as the previous versions. Therefore, this new  method is an important step toward utilization of TMFT for preclinical imaging.","2023-10-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","7420-7430","","28","62","","Appl Opt","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37855510","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the heterogeneity of the  skull and regional variations in modulation and treatment objectives, it is  necessary to develop an efficient and spatially controllable neuromodulation  approach. Recently, transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) combined with external  biomicro/nanomaterials for brain stimulation has garnered significant attention.  This study focused on tFUS combined with perfluoropentane (PFP) nanodroplets  (NDs) to improve the efficacy and spatial controllability of USNM. The developed  two-stage variable pulse tFUS sequence that include the acoustic droplet  vaporization (ADV) pulse for vaporizing PFP NDs into microbubbles (MBs) and the  USNM sequence for inducing mechanical oscillations of the formed MBs to enhance  neuronal activity. Further, adjusting the acoustic pressure of the ADV pulse  generated the controllable vaporization regions, thereby achieving spatially  controllable neuromodulation. The results showed that the mean densities of  c-fos(+) cells expression in the group of PFP NDs with ADV (109 ± 19 cells/mm(2))  were significantly higher compared to the group without ADV (37.34 ± 8.24  cells/mm(2)). The acoustic pressure of the ADV pulse with 1.98 MPa and 2.81 MPa  in vitro generated the vaporization regions of 0.146 ± 0.032 cm(2) and  0.349 ± 0.056 cm(2), respectively. Under the same stimulation conditions, a  larger vaporization region was also obtained with higher acoustic pressure in  vivo, inducing a broader region of neuronal activation. Therefore, this study  will serve as a valuable reference for developing the efficient and spatially  controllable tFUS neuromodulation strategy.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","106686","","","101","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023.

HIFU treatment information, efficacy comparisons and adverse events  were recorded. A nomogram model of the characteristic parameters used to predict  the efficacy of USg-HIFU in multiple fibroids was established. RESULTS: After  USg-HIFU treatment, the statistical comparison of pre-operative versus  post-operative symptom scores and fibroid volume in the two groups indicated  obvious symptom relief and substantial shrinkage of fibroid volume (all p values  <0.001). Nevertheless, group A required more energy and longer treatment and  sonication times to achieve a 70% non-perfused volume (NPV) ratio, and had a  lower energy efficiency factor than group B (all p values <0.05). No severe  complications were observed in either group. The nomogram model included fibroid  volume, fibroid location and signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). The  area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the accuracy of the  model were 0.698 and 0.686, respectively.

The length of surgery, bleeding,  hospitalization days, incidence of pelvic adhesions, and ovarian reserve function  indexes (FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone), LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and E2  (Estradiol)) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared to the  myomectomy group, the FUSA group had shorter operation time (P<0.001), no  bleeding (P<0.001), less hospitalization (P<0.001), lower incidence of pelvic  adhesion (P = 0.020), and less impairment of ovarian reserve function (Increased  FSH, LH and E2, all P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that the  maximum diameter of leiomyoma ≥5 cm (P = 0.008), the number of pregnancies ≥3 (P  = 0.003) and intraoperative hemorrhage (P = 0.004) were independent risk factors  for pelvic adhesion. CONCLUSIONS: FUSA is a safe and effective non-invasive  method for the treatment of uterine fibroids that reduces postoperative  complications and protects fertility potential, especially for female patients  with fertility concerns. Future studies need to overcome existing limitations to  improve reliability of evidence.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","6959-6969","","12","15","","Am J Transl Res","","","","","","","","eng","AJTR Copyright © 2023.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38187000  PMCID: PMC10767541","","","","Uterine fibroids; focused ultrasound ablation; myomectomy; pelvic adhesions; reproductive function","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DATA SOURCES:  We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase on September 30,  2022, and the related studies were independently reviewed by 2 researchers.  METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Medical subject headings and relevant terms from  other articles were used for the database search. Patients with CSP who underwent  HIFU were included in this analysis. The following results were recorded: success  rate, intraoperative blood loss, time for serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin  (beta-HCG) normalization and menstruation recovery, adverse events,  hospitalization time, and hospitalization expenses. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa  Scale scoring system and the methodological index for nonrandomized studies  system to evaluate the quality of the studies. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND  RESULTS: Data from 6 studies were used to compare the efficacy and safety of UAE  and HIFU. We pooled the success rate of HIFU by including 10 studies. No data  overlap between the 10 studies. Success rate was higher in the HIFU group (odds  ratio [OR] = 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-3.41; p = .03; I(2) = 0). We  performed the meta-analysis of single rate in R 4.2.0 software, and the success  rate of HIFU group was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96; p = .04; I(2) = 48%).  Intraoperative blood loss (mean difference [MD]= -21.94 mL; 95% CI -67.34 to  23.47; p = .34; I(2) = 99%) and time for serum beta-HCG normalization (MD = 3.13  days; 95% CI 0.02-6.25; p = .05; I(2) = 70%) were not significantly different.  Time to menstruation recovery (MD = 2.72 days; 95% CI 1.32-4.12; p = .0001;  I(2) = 0) in the UAE group was shorter than that in the HIFU group. Adverse  events were not significantly different between the 2 groups (OR = 0.53; 95% CI  0.22-1.29; p = .16; I(2) = 81%). Hospitalization time was not significantly  different between the HIFU and UAE groups (MD = -0.41 days; 95% CI -1.14 to 0.31;  p = .26; I(2) = 55%). Hospitalization expenses of the HIFU group were lower than  those of the UAE group (MD = -7488.49 yuan; 95% CI -8460.13 to -6516.84; p <.000;  I(2) = 0). Heterogeneity of the time for beta-HCG normalization, adverse events,  and hospitalization time were improved after excluding one study, and HIFU showed  better results in the sensitivity analysis of adverse events and hospitalization  time. CONCLUSION: According to our analysis, HIFU demonstrated satisfactory  treatment success, accompanied by similar intraoperative blood loss, slower  normalization of beta-HCG levels, and menstruation recovery, but potentially  shorter hospitalization time, lower adverse events and lower costs than UAE.  Therefore, HIFU is an effective, safe, and economical treatment for patients with  CSP. These conclusions should be interpreted with caution because of the  significant heterogeneity. However, large and strictly designed clinical trials  are required to verify these conclusions.","2023-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","446-454","","6","30","","J Minim Invasive Gynecol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 AAGL.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of  Science, CNKI, SinoMed, Wanfang, and VIP databases from their inception to Nov  20, 2021 for relevant articles that compared HIFU combined with LNG-IUS vs. HIFU  alone in patients with adenomyosis. RevMan5.4 software was used for the data  analysis. The primary outcome was changes in volume of the uterine. Secondary  outcomes included visual analog scale (VAS) scores for dysmenorrhea, serum CA125  level, recurrence rate, changes in volume of the adenomyotic lesion, menstrual  volume scores, and adverse reactions. Data synthesis was conducted using a  random-effects model with significant heterogeneity (I(2) > 50%), and using a  fixed-effects model otherwise. This study is registered on the PROSPERO platform  (CRD42021295214). RESULTS: The final analysis included 13 studies, with a total  of 1861 patients. Results of analysis revealed that there was no significant  difference in uterine volume reduction between the HIFU control group and the  HIFU/LNG-IUS group at 3 months after procedure (MD:30.63). Compared with the HIFU  control group, the HIFU/LNG-IUS group had more pronounced reduction in uterine  volume at 6 (MD:29.04) and 12 months (MD:22.10) after procedure. The HIFU/LNG-IUS  group has lower VAS scores for dysmenorrhea than the HIFU control group at 3  (MD:1.68), 6 (MD:1.69), and 12 months (MD:1.30) after procedure. Serum CA125  level in the HIFU/LNG-IUS group decreased more significantly than the HIFU  control group at 6 (MD:18.34) and 12 months (MD:18.49) after procedure. The  recurrence rate in the HIFU/LNG-IUS group was lower than that in the HIFU control  group (RR:0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to HIFU control group, HIFU/LNG-IUS group  for the management of adenomyosis had more advantages in alleviating symptoms and  decreasing the volumes of the uterine and adenomyotic lesions. However, since the  number of the included studies was too small and some of them were not RCT, this  conclusion needs to be referenced with caution.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","351-362","","2","308","","Arch Gynecol Obstet","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

We  evaluated the role of focal therapy in patients 70 years and older as an  alternative management modality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 649 patients  across 11 UK sites receiving focal high-intensity focused ultrasound or  cryotherapy between June 2006 and July 2020 reported within the UK-based HEAT  (HIFU Evaluation and Assessment of Treatment) and ICE (International Cryotherapy  Evaluation) registries were evaluated. Primary outcome was failure-free survival,  defined by need for more than 1 focal reablation, progression to radical  treatment, development of metastases, need for systemic treatment, or prostate  cancer-specific death. This was compared to the failure-free survival in patients  undergoing radical treatment via a propensity score weighted analysis. RESULTS:  Median age was 74 years (IQR: 72, 77) and median follow-up 24 months (IQR: 12,  41). Sixty percent had intermediate-risk disease and 35% high-risk disease. A  total of 113 patients (17%) required further treatment. Sixteen had radical  treatment and 44 required systemic treatment. Failure-free survival was 82% (95%  CI: 76%-87%) at 5 years. Comparing patients who had radical therapy to those who  had focal therapy, 5-year failure-free survival was 96% (95% CI: 93%-100%) and  82% (95% CI: 75%-91%) respectively (P < .001). Ninety-three percent of those in  the radical treatment arm had received radiotherapy as their primary treatment  with its associated use of androgen deprivation therapy, thereby leading to  potential overestimation of treatment success in the radical treatment arm,  especially given the similar metastases-free and overall survival rates seen.  CONCLUSIONS: We propose focal therapy to be an effective management option for  the older or comorbid patient who is unsuitable for or not willing to undergo  radical treatment.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","108-116","","1","210","","J Urol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37014172","","","","*Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology; Aged; Androgen Antagonists; Humans; Male; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostate/pathology; Treatment Outcome; ablation techniques; aged; cryotherapy; high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation; prostatic neoplasms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: With the approval of the institutional ethics committee and written  informed consent, a total of 113 patients diagnosed with breast fibroadenoma by  core-needle biopsy in our hospital were recruited. USgHIFU surgery was performed  under local anesthesia. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) or contrast-enhanced  MRI (CEMRI) was performed to evaluate the nonperfused volume (NPV). The patients  were followed up with physical examination and ultrasound imaging. RESULTS: The  clinical outcome of 85 patients with 147 fibroadenomas with a follow-up time of  more than 3 months was analyzed in this study. Fifty-two patients had one lesion,  twenty-one patients had two lesions and twelve patients had more than two  lesions. During USgHIFU, the median localization time for all fibroadenomas was 3  (interquartile range: 1, 5) min, and the median treatment time was 9  (interquartile range: 5, 15) min. Under local anesthesia, all the patients  tolerated the treatment well. No serious epidermal burns were observed in any of  the patients. Based on CEUS or CEMRI imaging evaluation, the median NPV ratio was  100% (interquartile range: 79.2%, 116.8%). The VRR were 26.77 ± 50.05%,  50.22 ± 42.01% and 72.74 ± 35.39% at 3-6 months, 6-12 months and >12 months,  respectively, which showed significant statistical difference (p < .001).

In at  least 30-50% of patients, tremor interferes with quality of life, does not  respond to first-line therapies and/or intolerable adverse effects may occur.  Therefore, surgery may be considered. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors  discuss and compare unilateral ventral intermedius nucleus deep brain stimulation  (VIM DBS) and bilateral DBS with Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound  (MRgFUS) thalamotomy, which comprises focused acoustic energy generating ablation  under real-time MRI guidance. Discussion includes their impact on tremor  reduction and their potential complications. Finally, the authors provide their  expert opinion. EXPERT OPINION: DBS is adjustable, potentially reversible and  allows bilateral treatments; however, it is invasive requires hardware  implantation, and has higher surgical risks. Instead, MRgFUS is less invasive,  less expensive, and requires no hardware maintenance. Beyond these technical  differences, the decision should also involve the patient, family, and  caregivers.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","603-619","","7","23","","Expert Rev Neurother","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37288812","","","","*Deep Brain Stimulation; *Essential Tremor/surgery; Essential tremor; Humans; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome; Tremor/therapy; advanced management; deep brain stimulation; focused ultrasound; tremor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
