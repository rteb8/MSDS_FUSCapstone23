Both bariatric surgery and surgical fat removal have been shown to improve  metabolic health, but the metabolic benefits of nonsurgical fat removal remain  uncertain. The aim of this paper is to establish whether nonsurgical fat removal  exerts measurable, lasting metabolic benefits by way of changes to serum lipid  profiles. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, and clinical trials  registers were searched using the Polyglot Search Translator to find studies  examining quantitative changes in metabolic markers after nonsurgical body  contouring procedures. The MethodologicAl STandard for Epidemiological Research  (MASTER) scale was adopted for the quality assessment of the included studies.  The robust-error meta-regression (REMR) model was employed. RESULTS: Twenty-two  studies and 676 participants were included. Peak body compositions measures  manifest as a reduction of 2 units in body mass index (BMI), 1 kg of body weight  (BW), 5 cm in waist circumference (WC) and 1.5 cm in abdominal fat thickness  (FT), sustained up to 60 days postprocedure. Transient increases of 15 mg/dL in  low-density lipoprotein (LDL), 10 mg/dl in triglycerides (TG), and 15 mg/dl in  total cholesterol (TC) were observed at 2 weeks postprocedure. CONCLUSION: While  nonsurgical fat removal exerts sustained effects on body anthropometrics, changes  to serum lipid profiles were transient. There is no compelling evidence at  present to support the conclusion that nonsurgical fat removal is metabolically  beneficial.","2023-02","2024-03-06 17:11:57","2024-03-06T17:11:57Z","","68-77","","","77","","J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

MATERIALS AND  METHODS: A total of 91 patients were divided into groups based on non-perfused  volume (NPV) ratio and blood supply type. The preoperative MRI parameters were  measured and analysed. A correlation analysis between the MRI parameters and the  NPV ratio was performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used  to analyse and determine the cut-off value of MRI parameters to predict the  ablation rate of fibroids. RESULTS: The uterine fibroids group with an NPV ratio  <80% and the group with an NPV ratio of ≥80% had significant differences in  signal intensity (SI) at MRI T2-weighted imaging (WI), fibroid-to-rectus  abdominis SI ratio (SIR) at T2WI, and blood supply type (p<0.05). There were no  significant differences in fibroid volume, T2WI signal uniformity, and apparent  diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. The ADC value and SI and SIR at MRI T2WI in  the group with poor blood supply were lower than those in the group with a rich  blood supply (p<0.05). SI at MRI T2WI correlated negatively with the NPV ratio.  The cut-off values for SI and SIR at MRI T2WI of fibroids whose NPV ratio exceeds  80% were 220.58 and 1.315, respectively. CONCLUSION: SI at MRI T2WI and blood  supply type could be predictors of the efficacy of ablation. Ultrasonic ablation  of fibroids with MRI T2WI hyperintensity and a rich blood supply had poor  efficacy.","2023-01","2024-03-06 17:11:43","2024-03-06T17:11:43Z","","61-69","","1","78","","Clin Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Royal College of Radiologists.

Musculoskeletal tumoral diseases would definitely benefit from a low-invasive approach that could reduce mortality and morbidity in particular. Thermal ablation through IR has already become important in the palliation and consolidation of bone metastases, oligometastatic disease, local recurrences, and treating specific benign tumors, with a more tailored approach, considering the characteristics of every patient. As image-guided ablation techniques lower their invasiveness and increase their efficacy while the collateral effects and complications decrease, they become more relevant and need to be considered in patient care pathways and clinical management, to improve outcomes.

Simulations that employ a numerical propagator matrix and a Semi-Analytical  approach establish the transcranial dispersion characteristics and transmission  coefficients at different incident angles. Experimental transmission tests  conducted at 500 kHz and radiation tests performed in the 200-800 kHz range  confirm the numerical findings in terms of transmitted peak pressure and  frequency-radiation angle spectra, based on which the connection between critical  angles, dispersion and transmission is demonstrated. Our results support the  identification of transcranial ultrasound strategies that leverage shear mode  conversion, which is less sensitive to phase aberrations compared to normal  incidence ultrasound. These findings can also enable higher transmission rates in  cranial bones with low porosity by leveraging dispersion information extracted  through signal processing, without requiring measurement of geometric and  mechanical properties of the cranial bone.","2023-02","2024-03-06 17:11:17","2024-03-06T17:11:17Z","","106882","","","128","","Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, the  effectiveness of two extraction techniques (i.e. focused ultrasound solid-liquid  extraction (FUSLE) and QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe))  was evaluated, and the clean-up step using solid-phase extraction (SPE) was also  thoroughly studied. The method was successfully validated at 10 μg·kg(-1),  25 μg·kg(-1), and 50 μg·kg(-1) showing adequate trueness (70-130%) and  repeatability (RSD < 30%), with few exceptions. Procedural limits of  quantification (LOQ(PRO)) were determined for soil:compost (0.45 to  7.50 μg·kg(-1)) and manure (0.31 to 5.53 μg·kg(-1)) samples. Pefloxacin could not  be validated at the lowest level since LOQ(PRO) ≥ 10 μg·kg(-1).

MF are characterized by the loss  of a stable response to levodopa over the nychthemeron with the reappearance of  motor (and non-motor) parkinsonian clinical signs at various moments during the  day and night. They normally appear after a few years of levodopa treatment and  with a variable, though overall increasing severity, over the disease course. The  armamentarium of first-line treatment options has widened in the last decade with  new once-a-daily compounds, including a catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitor -  Opicapone-, two MAO-B inhibitors plus channel blocker - Zonisamide and Safinamide  and one amantadine extended-release formulation - ADS5012. In addition to  apomorphine injection or oral levodopa dispersible tablets, which have been  available for a long time, new on-demand therapies such as apomorphine sublingual  or levodopa inhaled formulations have recently shown efficacy as rescue therapies  for Off-time treatment. When the management of MF becomes difficult in spite of  oral/on-demand options, more complex therapies should be considered, including  surgical, i.e. deep brain stimulation, or device-aided therapies with pump  systems delivering continuous subcutaneous or intestinal levodopa or subcutaneous  apomorphine formulation. Older and less commonly used ablative techniques  (radiofrequency pallidotomy) may also be effective while there is still scarce  data regarding Off-time reduction using a new lesional approach, i.e. magnetic  resonance-guided focused ultrasound. The choice between the different advanced  therapies options is a shared decision that should consider physician opinion on  contraindication/main target symptom, patients' preference, caregiver's  availability together with public health systems and socio-economic environment.  The choice of the right/first add-on treatment is still a matter of debate as  well as the proper time for an advanced therapy to be considered. In this  narrative review, we discuss all the above cited aspects of MF in patients with  PD, including their phenomenology, management, by means of pharmacological and  advanced therapies, on-going clinical trials and future research and treatment  perspectives.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","391-424","","2","12","","Neurol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Theta-burst TUS (tbTUS) is a plasticity-inducing protocol which increases motor  cortical excitability for up to 30 min following 80s of sonication. While this  protocol may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of psychiatric and  neurological disorders, the mechanisms of action of TUS remain unclear.  OBJECTIVE: We conducted the first pharmacological study to examine the mechanisms  of TUS in human primary motor cortex. By administering brain-active drugs with  known mechanisms of action, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of tbTUS.  METHODS: Fourteen healthy subjects participated in a within-subjects randomized,  double-blind, cross-over study with five visits. At each visit, one of four study  drugs (carbamazepine - Na(+) channel blocker, nimodipine - L-type Ca(2+) channel  blocker, lorazepam - positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid  (GABA) type A receptor, dextromethorphan - N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor  antagonist) or placebo was administered in random order, followed by tbTUS.  RESULTS: The plasticity effects of tbTUS on motor cortex excitability measured by  motor-evoked potential amplitudes elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation  were reduced by all study drugs compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: tbTUS may induce  NMDA-dependent synaptic plasticity since the effects are blocked by increased  GABA(A) receptor activities and voltage-gated Na(+) and Ca(2+) channels blockers.  These results are consistent with the hypotheses that tbTUS induced long-term  potentiation-like mechanisms and that TUS involves activation of mechanosensitive  Na(+) and Ca(2+) channels. Alternatively, non-specific pharmacologically induced  changes in excitatory/inhibitory balance might have interfered with the effects  of tbTUS.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1135-1143","","4","16","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023.

In children, exhaustion of compensatory  mechanisms in respiratory or circulatory failure leads to cardiac arrest.  Recognition and treatment of children in critical condition are the most  important element of its prevention. With the ABCDE approach, life-threatening  problems can be identified and treated using simple interventions (bag-mask  ventilation, intraosseous access, fluid bolus, etc.). Important new  recommendations: 4-hand ventilation during bag-mask ventilation, target  saturation of 94-98% during oxygen therapy, and fluid bolus of 10 ml/kg. In  pediatric basic life support, if there is no normal breathing after 5 initial  rescue breaths in absence of signs of life, chest compression should be initiated  immediately using primarily two-thumb encircling method for infants. Recommended  rate is 100-120/min, ratio of compression to ventilation is 15 : 2. Pediatric  advanced life support is a teamwork. The structure of the algorithm is unchanged,  high-quality chest compression is still a paramount. Recognition and treatment of  potential reversible causes (4H-4T) and the decisive role of focused ultrasound  are emphasized. New features: recommendation of 4-hand technique bag-mask  ventilation, role of capnography, and age-dependent ventilatory rate in the case  of continuous chest compression after endotracheal intubation. Drug therapy is  unchanged, the fastest way to administer adrenaline during resuscitation is via  intraosseous access. Treatment after return of spontaneous circulation decisively  influences neurological outcome. Patient care is further based on the ABCDE  scheme. Important goals are maintaining normoxia, normocapnia, avoiding  hypotension, hypoglycemia, fever and use of targeted temperature management.

Its calculation  requires precise continuous tracking of the aortic diameter over the cardiac  cycle, which is not feasible by focused ultrasound. We aimed to develop an  automatic aortic acquisition using ultrafast ultrasound imaging (UUI) to provide  access to the aortic MRSD. Methods: A phased array probe and developed sequences  at 2000 frames/s were used. A created interface automatically tracked the  anterior and posterior aortic walls over the cardiac cycle. Tissue Doppler  allowed a precise estimation of the walls' movements. MRSD was the maximum  derivative of the aortic diameter curve over time. To assess its feasibility, 34  patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and 31 controls were consecutively  included to evaluate the BAV-associated aortopathy at the sinus of Valsalva, the  tubular ascending aorta, and the aortic arch. Results: UUI acquisitions and the  dedicated interface allow tracking of the aortic diameter and calculating the  MRSD for the BAV patients and controls (mean age of 34 vs. 43 years, p = 0.120).  A trend toward lower deformation in the different aortic segments was observed,  as expected. Still, only the MRSD with UUI was significantly different at the  sinus of Valsalva in this small series: (0.61 .10(3).s(-1) [0.37-0.72] for BAV  patients vs. 0.92 .10(3).s(-1) [0.72-1.02] for controls, p = 0.025).

AIM: To  evaluate the efficacy and satisfaction rates of MFU-V for facial and neck laxity  treatment by providing a basis for developing a validated scoring system for  MFU-V treatment. METHOD: A constrictive survey was carried out by selecting  relevant publications on MFU-V treatment of facial and neck laxity using PubMed,  Medline, and Embase electronic databases from January 2017 to March 2022.  RESULTS: Of the 11 original articles used in this review, the majority of the  scoring methods used were the subjective global aesthetic improvement scale and  the 5-point scale rating global aesthetic improvement in appearance. Around half  of the patients were described as much improved or very much improved on days 30  and 90, while most returned to baseline on Day 360. Most of the adverse events  reported were mild bruising, redness, and pain. None of the patients reported  serious adverse events. A burn occurred in one case because of improper  application of the probe. CONCLUSION: The MFU-V provides excellent and promising  responses for treating facial and neck laxity. A few mild events were observed,  such as erythema, pain, edema, and injection-site induration, all of which  resolved within approximately 2-3 days.","2023-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","2671-2676","","10","22","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.

In IMR, an  isolated, spherical microbubble is generated inside a soft material, using either  a spatially-focused pulsed laser or focused ultrasound, to probe the mechanical  behavior of the soft material at high strain rates (>10(3) s(-1)). Then, a  theoretical modeling framework for inertial microcavitation, incorporating all  the dominant physics, is used to extract information regarding the mechanical  behavior of the soft material by fitting model predictions to the experimentally  measured bubble dynamics. To model the cavitation dynamics, approaches based on  extensions of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation are commonly used; however, these  approaches cannot consider bubble dynamics that involves appreciable compressible  behavior and place a limit on the nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive models that  may be employed to describe the soft material. To circumvent these limitations,  in this work, we develop a finite-element-based numerical simulation capability  for inertial microcavitation of spherical bubbles that enables appreciable  compressibility to be accounted for and more complex viscoelastic constitutive  laws to be incorporated. We first apply the numerical simulation capability to  understanding the role of material compressibility during violent spherical  bubble collapse, and based on finite-element simulations, we propose a  Mach-number-based threshold of 0.08, beyond which bubble collapse is violent, and  the bubble dynamics involves compressibility not accounted for in  Rayleigh-Plesset-based approaches. Second, we consider more complex viscoelastic  constitutive models for the surrounding material, including nonlinear elastic and  power-law viscous behavior, and apply IMR by fitting computational results to  experimental data from inertial microcavitation of polyacrylamide (PA) gels in  order to determine material parameters for PA gels at high strain rates.","2023-05-31","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","3895-3909","","21","19","","Soft Matter","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37195685","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many advancements in  formulation technology and modification of delivery approaches have been  successful in delivering the drug to the brain in the therapeutic window. The  nose to the brain (N2B) drug delivery employing the nanoformulation, is one such  emerging delivery approach, overcoming both classical drug formulation and  delivery-associated limitations. This latter approach offers increased  bioavailability, greater patient acceptance, lesser metabolic degradation of  drugs, circumvention of BBB, ample drug loading along with the controlled release  of the drugs. In N2B delivery, the intranasal (IN) route carries therapeutics  firstly into the nasal cavity followed by the brain through olfactory and  trigeminal nerve connections linked with nasal mucosa. The N2B delivery approach  is being explored for delivering other biologicals like neuropeptides and  mitochondria. Meanwhile, this N2B delivery system is associated with critical  challenges consisting of mucociliary clearance, degradation by enzymes, and drug  translocations by efflux mechanisms. These challenges finally culminated in the  development of suitable surfacemodified nano-carriers and Focused-  Ultrasound-Assisted IN as FUS-IN technique which has expanded the horizons of N2B  drug delivery. Hence, nanotechnology, in collaboration with advances in the IN  route of drug administration, has a diversified approach for treating PD. The  present review discusses the physiology and limitation of IN delivery along with  current advances in nanocarrier and technical development assisting N2B drug  delivery.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","493-516","","3","21","","Curr Neuropharmacol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 35524671  PMCID: PMC10207920","","","","*Drug Delivery Systems; *Nanotechnology; *Nasal Mucosa/innervation/metabolism; *Parkinson Disease/therapy; Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism; Brain/metabolism; Humans; Parkinson's disease; blood-brain-barrier; intranasal; nano drug delivery; nano-carriers; nose-to-brain delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rehabilitation is the  essential treatment for post-stroke patients suffering from functional  impairments, through which hemiparesis, aphasia, dysphagia, unilateral neglect,  depression, and cognitive dysfunction can be restored to various degrees.  Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is a popular neuromodulatory technology of  rehabilitation focusing on the local cerebral cortex, which can improve clinical  functions by regulating the excitability of corresponding neurons. Increasing  evidence has been obtained from the clinical application of NIBS, especially  repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct  current stimulation (tDCS). However, without a standardized protocol, existing  studies on NIBS show a wide variation in terms of stimulation site, frequency,  intensity, dosage, and other parameters. Its application for neurorehabilitation  in post-stroke patients is still limited. With advances in neuronavigation  technologies, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, and functional MRI, specific  brain regions can be precisely located for stimulation. On the basis of our  further understanding on neural circuits, neuromodulation in post-stroke  rehabilitation has also evolved from single-target stimulation to co-stimulation  of two or more targets, even circuits and the network. The present study aims to  review the findings of current research, discuss future directions of NIBS  application, and finally promote the use of NIBS in post-stroke rehabilitation.","2023-03-06","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","3","13","","Brain Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36979261  PMCID: PMC10046557","","","","noninvasive brain stimulation; post-stroke; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; transcranial direct current stimulation; transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation; transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With increasing attention on modeling human brain diseases in  marmosets, understanding how to deliver therapeutic or neurotropic agents to the  marmoset brain noninvasively is of great preclinical importance. In other  species, including humans, transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) aided by  intravenously injected microbubbles has proven to be a transient, reliable, and  safe method for disrupting the blood-brain barrier (BBB), allowing the focal  passage of therapeutic agents that do not otherwise readily traverse the tight  endothelial junctions of the BBB. The critical gap that we address here is to  document parameters to disrupt the BBB reliably and safely in marmosets using  tFUS. By integrating our marmoset brain atlases and the use of a  marmoset-specific stereotactic targeting system, we conduct a series of  systematic transcranial sonication experiments in nine marmosets. We demonstrate  the effects of center frequency, acoustic pressure, burst period, and duration,  establish a minimum microbubble dose, estimate microbubble clearance time, and  estimate the duration that the BBB remains open to passage. Successful BBB  disruption is reported in vivo with MRI-based contrast agents, as well as Evans  blue staining assessed ex vivo. Histology (Hematoxylin and Eosin staining) and  immunohistochemistry indicate that the BBB can be safely and reliably opened with  the parameters derived from these experiments. The series of experiments  presented here establish methods for safely, reproducibly, and focally perturbing  the BBB using tFUS in the common marmoset monkey that can serve as a basis for  noninvasive delivery of therapeutic or neurotropic agents.","2023-08-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","806","","1","6","","Commun Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

MATERIALS AND  METHODS: FUS, operating in a pulsed mode, was applied to a dialysis cassette  immersed in a normal saline bath containing both bovine serum albumin (BSA) and  cisplatin, and the unbound level of cisplatin diffused into the cassette was  measured. To assess the in vivo efficacy of the technique, athymic nu/nu mice  were inoculated with human cervical cancer cells under four different combinatory  conditions, with and without the administration of cisplatin and FUS. FUS was  delivered to the tumor mass for 1 h across four separate sessions spanning a  period of 10 days, following the intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin. RESULTS:  In vitro equilibrium dialysis revealed that non-thermal application of FUS  increased the concentration of unbound cisplatin compared to cassettes that were  not exposed to sonication, suggesting successful unbinding. Assessment of tumor  growth in vivo showed that FUS following cisplatin administration resulted in a  significant reduction in tumor growth, whereas the administration of cisplatin  alone exhibited plateau growth. Without administration of cisplatin, equivalent  rates of aggressive tumor growth were observed regardless of the application of  FUS. CONCLUSION: Pulsed application of FUS can unbind cisplatin from albumin and  enhance its tumoricidal effects in cervical cancer. Further assessment of  intratumoral/systemic cisplatin concentration is required to quantify its  selective delivery to the tumor.","2023-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","4793-4800","","11","43","","Anticancer Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

However, the short-acting activated anti-tumor  immunity of post-ablation will rapidly reverse into an immunosuppressive state,  and the recurrent metastasis owing to incomplete ablation is closely associated  with a dismal prognosis for the patients. In recent years, numerous nanoplatforms  have been developed to improve the local ablative effect through enhancing the  targeting delivery and combining it with chemotherapy. Particularly, amplifying  the anti-tumor immune stimulus signal, modulating the immunosuppressive  microenvironment, and improving the anti-tumor immune response with the versatile  nanoplatforms have heralded great application prospects for improving the local  control and preventing tumor recurrence and distant metastasis. This review  discusses recent advances in nanoplatform-potentiated ablation-immune synergistic  tumor therapy, focusing on common ablation techniques including radiofrequency,  microwave, laser, and high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation, cryoablation,  and magnetic hyperthermia ablation, etc. We discuss the advantages and challenges  of the corresponding therapies and propose possible directions for future  research, which is expected to provide references for improving the traditional  ablation efficacy.","2023-05-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","5","15","","Pharmaceutics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37242696  PMCID: PMC10224284","","","","immunotherapy; nanoparticles; synergistic anti-tumor effect; tumor ablation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we report a temperature-sensitive genome-editing  nanodevice that can deliver a Cas9 editor with an external trigger which can be  used to edit the genome of tumour cells to reduce resistance to apoptosis and  modulate the tumour microenvironment via a mild heating trigger. After local or  systemic delivery of Cas9, mild heating is induced by non-invasive near-infrared  (NIR) light or focused ultrasound (FUS) to activate Cas9, which initiates  simultaneous genome editing of HSP70 (HSPA1A) and BAG3 in tumour cells. This  disrupts the apoptotic resistance machinery of the tumour cells against adoptive  T cells. At the same time, an NIR- or FUS-induced mild thermal effect reshapes  the extracellular tumour microenvironment by disrupting the physical barriers and  immune suppression. This facilitates the infiltration of adoptive T cells and  enhances their therapeutic activity. Mild thermal Cas9 delivery is demonstrated  in different murine tumour models which mimic a range of clinical indications,  including a tumour model based on humanized patient-derived xenografts. As a  result, the non-invasive thermal delivery of Cas9 significantly enhances the  therapeutic efficacies of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and chimeric antigen  receptor T and shows potential for clinical application.","2023-08","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","933-944","","8","18","","Nat Nanotechnol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

In this work,  ultrasound-switchable fluorescence (USF) technique was utilized to estimate the  local background temperature for the first time by analyzing the temperature  dependence of fluorescence emission from USF contrast agents induced by a focused  ultrasound (FU) beam. First, temperature-sensitive USF agents with distinct  temperature switching-on thresholds were synthesized, and their thermal switching  characteristics were quantified using an independent spectrometer system. Second,  the USF contrast agent suspension was injected into a microtube that was embedded  into a phantom and the dynamic USF signal was acquired using a camera-based USF  system. The differential profile of the measured dynamic USF signal was computed  and compared with the thermal switching characteristics. This allowed for the  calculation of the local background temperature of the sample in the FU focal  volume based on the estimation of heating speed. An infrared (IR) camera was used  to acquire the surface temperature of the sample and further compare it with the  USF system. The results showed that the difference between the temperatures  acquired from the USF thermometry and the IR thermography was 0.64 ± 0.43 °C when  operating at the physiological temperature range from 35.27 to 39.31 °C. These  results indicated the potential use of the USF system for measuring the local  temperature in diseased tissues non-invasively.

High-risk NB requires an aggressive  chemoradiotherapy regimen that causes significant off-target toxicity. Despite  this invasive treatment, many patients either relapse or do not respond  adequately. Recent studies suggest that improving tumor perfusion can enhance  drug accumulation and distribution within the tumor tissue, potentially  augmenting treatment effects without inflicting systemic toxicity. Accordingly,  methods that transiently increase tumor perfusion prior to treatment may help  combat this disease. Here, we show the use of gene therapy to confer inducible  nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression solely in the tumor space, using focused  ultrasound targeting. NOS catalyzes the reaction that generates nitric oxide  (NO), a potent endogenous vasodilator. This study reports the development of a  targeted non-viral image-guided platform to deliver iNOS-expressing plasmid DNA  (pDNA) to vascular endothelial cells encasing tumor blood vessels. Following  transfection, longitudinal quantitative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (qCEUS)  imaging revealed an increase in tumor perfusion over 72 h, attributed to elevated  intratumoral iNOS expression. Methods: To construct a gene delivery vector,  cationic ultrasound-responsive agents (known as ""microbubbles"") were employed to  carry pDNA in circulation and transfect tumor vascular endothelial cells in vivo  using focused ultrasound (FUS) energy. This was followed by liposomal doxorubicin  (L-DOX) treatment. The post-transfection tumor response was monitored  longitudinally using qCEUS imaging to determine relative changes in blood volumes  and perfusion rates. After therapy, ex vivo analysis of tumors was performed to  examine the bioeffects associated with iNOS expression. Results: By combining FUS  therapy with cationic ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs), we achieved selective  intratumoral transfection of pDNA encoding the iNOS enzyme. While transitory, the  degree of expression was sufficient to induce significant increases in tumoral  perfusion, to appreciably enhance the chemotherapeutic payload and to extend  survival time in an orthotopic xenograft model. Conclusion: We have demonstrated  the ability of a novel targeted non-viral gene therapy strategy to enhance tumor  perfusion and improve L-DOX delivery to NB xenografts. While our results  demonstrate that transiently increasing tumor perfusion improves  liposome-encapsulated chemotherapeutic uptake and distribution, we expect that  our iNOS gene delivery paradigm can also significantly improve radio and  immunotherapies by increasing the delivery of radiosensitizers and  immunomodulators, potentially improving upon current NB treatment without  concomitant adverse effects. Our findings further suggest that qCEUS imaging can  effectively monitor changes in tumor perfusion in vivo, allowing the  identification of an ideal time-point to administer therapy.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","3402-3418","","10","13","","Theranostics","","","","","","","","eng","© The author(s).","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 37351172  PMCID: PMC10283050","","","","*Neuroblastoma/drug therapy; *Nitric Oxide/metabolism; Child; DNA; Doxorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Endothelial Cells/metabolism; Genetic Therapy; Humans; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/genetics/metabolism; Perfusion; and quantitative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (qCEUS); gene therapy; inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); neuroblastoma; sonopermeation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The insula has been parsed into  sub-regions based upon cytoarchitectonics and structural and functional  connectivity with multiple lines of evidence supporting specific roles for each  of these sub-regions in pain processing and interoception. In the past, causal  interrogation of the insula was only possible in patients with surgically  implanted electrodes. Here, we leverage the high spatial resolution combined with  the deep penetration depth of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) to  non-surgically modulate either the anterior insula (AI) or posterior insula (PI)  in humans for effect on subjective pain ratings, electroencephalographic (EEG)  contact head evoked potentials (CHEPs) and time-frequency power as well as  autonomic measures including heart-rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal  response (EDR). N = 23 healthy volunteers received brief noxious heat pain  stimuli to the dorsum of their right hand during continuous heart-rate, EDR and  EEG recording. LIFU was delivered to either the AI (anterior short gyrus), PI  (posterior longus gyrus) or under an inert sham condition time-locked to the heat  stimulus. Results demonstrate that single-element 500 kHz LIFU is capable of  individually targeting specific gyri of the insula. LIFU to both AI and PI  similarly reduced perceived pain ratings but had differential effects on EEG  activity. LIFU to PI affected earlier EEG amplitudes around 300 milliseconds  whereas LIFU to AI affected EEG amplitudes around 500 milliseconds. In addition,  only LIFU to the AI affected HRV as indexed by an increase in standard deviation  of N-N intervals (SDNN) and mean HRV low frequency power. There was no effect of  LIFU to either AI or PI on EDR or blood pressure. Taken together, LIFU looks to  be an effective method to individually target sub-regions of the insula in humans  for site-specific effects on brain biomarkers of pain processing and autonomic  reactivity that translates to reduced perceived pain to a transient heat  stimulus. These data have implications for the treatment of chronic pain and  several neuropsychological diseases like anxiety, depression and addiction that  all demonstrate abnormal activity in the insula concomitant with dysregulated  autonomic function.","2023-05-05","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","United States","eng","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: bioRxiv Pages: 2023.05.05.539593 Publication Title: bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology PMID: 37205396  PMCID: PMC10187309","","","","Heart-rate Variability; Human; Insula; Interoception; Low-intensity focused ultrasound; Neuromodulation; Pain; Transcranial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is helpful in investigating the mid-term grading  efficacy and safety of MRgFUS, and possible risk factors in participants with  painful bone metastases. METHODS: This four-center prospective study enrolled 96  participants between June 2016 and May 2019 with painful bone metastases. The  Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Brief Pain Inventory-Quality of Life (BPI-QoL)  score, morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD), and the adverse events (AEs) were  recorded before and at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after MRgFUS. The  repeated ANOVA tests were used to analyze the change in NRS and BPI-QoL, and  logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the possible risk factors.  RESULTS: A total of 82 participants completed the 3-month follow-up period. And  16 (19.5%) participants were complete responders (CR), 46 (56.1%) participants  were effective responders (ER), and the other 20 (24.4%) participants were  non-responders (NR). The NRS (2.67 ± 2.47 at 3 months compared to 6.38 ± 1.70  before treatment) and BPI-QoL score (3.11 ± 2.51 at 3 months compared to 5.40 ±  1.85 before treatment) significantly decreased after the treatment at all time  points (p < 0.001). Eleven adverse events were recorded and they were all cured  within 1 to 52 days after treatment. The non-perfused volume (NPV) ratio (p =  0.001) and the bone metastases lesion type (p = 0.025) were the key risk factors.  CONCLUSIONS: MRgFUS can be used as a non-invasive, effective, and safe modality  to treat painful bone metastases. NPV ratio and the lesion type may be used as  affecting factors to predict the mid-term efficacy of MRgFUS. KEY POINTS: •  MRgFUS can be considered a non-invasive, effective, and safe modality to treat  painful bone metastases. • The NRS and BPI-QoL score at 1 week, 1 month, 2  months, and 3 months all decreased significantly (p < 0.001) after receiving  MRgFUS. Among 82 participants, 16 (19.5%) were complete responders, 46 (56.1%)  were effective responders, and the other 20 (24.4%) were non-responders. •  According to logistic regression analysis, non-perfused volume ratio and the bone  metastases lesion type were the affecting factors to predict the mid-term  efficacy of MRgFUS.

Despite improvements in medical care, 20 to 30% of patients are still  resistant to the best medical treatment. The quality of life, neurologic  morbidity, and even mortality of patients are significantly impacted by medically  intractable epilepsy. Nowadays, conservative therapeutic approaches consist of  increasing medication dosage, changing to a different anti-seizure drug as  monotherapy, and combining different antiseizure drugs using an add-on strategy.  However, such measures may not be sufficient to efficiently control seizure  recurrence. Resective surgery, ablative procedures and non-resective  neuromodulatory (deep-brain stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation) treatments are  the available treatments for these kinds of patients. However, invasive  procedures may involve lengthy inpatient stays for the patients, risks of  long-term neurological impairment, general anesthesia, and other possible  surgery-related complications (i.e., hemorrhage or infection). In the last few  years, MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been proposed as an emerging  treatment for neurological diseases because of technological advancements and the  goal of minimally invasive neurosurgery. By outlining the current knowledge  obtained from both preclinical and clinical studies and discussing the technical  opportunities of this therapy for particular epileptic phenotypes, in this  perspective review, we explore the various mechanisms and potential applications  (thermoablation, blood-brain barrier opening for drug delivery, neuromodulation)  of high- and low-intensity ultrasound, highlighting possible novel strategies to  treat drug-resistant epileptic patients who are not eligible or do not accept  currently established surgical approaches. Taken together, the available studies  support a possible role for lesional treatment over the anterior thalamus with  high-intensity ultrasound and neuromodulation of the hippocampus via  low-intensity ultrasound in refractory epilepsy. However, more studies, likely  conceiving epilepsy as a network disorder and bridging together different scales  and modalities, are required to make ultrasound delivery strategies meaningful,  effective, and safe.","2023-11-13","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","22","12","","J Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 38002683  PMCID: PMC10672423","","","","MRgFUS; ablation; intractable epilepsy; low-frequency modulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Secondarily, to evaluate  effectiveness of the procedure. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent  MRgFUS at our institution were retrospectively identified. Chart review was  performed to obtain relevant clinical and technical data. All patients had  chronic low back pain and positive comparative medial branch blocks. RESULTS:  Twenty-six MRgFUS treatments in 20 patients were included. Mean sonication energy  was 1436.6 Joules. The procedure was technically successful in all patients. Of  the treated patients, 29.6% experienced short-term worsening of low back pain  immediately after the procedure, all by 1-4 points on a 0-10 scale. One patient  (3.8%) reported temporary worsening of preexisting radicular symptoms after the  procedure. Of 21 treatments with clinical follow-up of at least 3 months  available, 12 (57.1%) had >3 months' pain relief, 2 (10%) had <3 months' benefit,  6 (30%) reported no benefit, and 1 (5%) patient was lost to follow-up. In  patients who reported at least some benefit with prior conventional  radiofrequency ablation, 8/10 (80%) benefited from the MRgFUS procedure.  CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that MRgFUS ablation of the lumbar  facet joints is a safe and tolerable procedure in human subjects and could  provide another option for patients for whom radiofrequency ablation had failed.  More than half of all patients received significant durable pain relief, which  jumped to 80% for patients who had experienced at least some benefit from prior  radiofrequency ablations.","2023-11-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1219-1223","","11","24","","Pain Med","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2023.

Tremor  severity (Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Rating Scale) was evaluated and functional  connectivity was investigated using independent component analysis. RESULTS:  MRgFUS of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus reduced contralateral tremor  effectively. Multiple regression analysis revealed exclusively negative  correlations between FC and tremor severity, notably in the right cerebellar lobe  VI and the left cerebellar lobe VIIIa (cerebellar network), in the left occipital  fusiform gyrus (lateral visual network), the anterior division of the left  superior temporal gyrus (fronto-parieto-temporal network), and in the posterior  division of the left parahippocampal gyrus and the bilateral lingual gyri  (default mode network). Six months after treatment, increased functional  connectivity was observed in almost all tremor-associated clusters, except the  cluster localized in the left cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that  tremor-related activity in essential tremor extends beyond the classical  cerebellar network, additionally involving areas related to visual processing.

Focused ultrasound (FUS) and microbubbles (MBs)  have been shown to cause BBB disruption (BBBD), allowing larger chemotherapeutics  to enter the parenchyma. Panobinostat is an example of a promising in vitro agent  in DIPG with poor clinical efficacy due to low BBB penetrance. In this study, we  hypothesized that using FUS to disrupt the BBB allows higher concentrations of  panobinostat to accumulate in the tumor, providing a therapeutic effect. Mice  were orthotopically injected with a patient-derived DMG cell line, BT-245. MRI  was used to guide FUS/MB (1.5 MHz, 0.615 MPa PNP, 1 Hz PRF, 10 ms PL, 3 min  treatment time) / (25 µL/kg, IV) targeting to the tumor location. In animals  receiving panobinostat (10 mg/kg, IP) in combination with FUS/MB, a 3-fold  increase in tumor panobinostat concentration was observed, with only  insignificant increase of the drug in the forebrain. In mice receiving three  weekly treatments, the combination of panobinostat and FUS/MB led to a 71%  reduction of tumor volumes by MRI ( p = 0.01). Furthermore, FUS/MB improved the  mean survival from 21 to 31 days ( p < 0.0001). Our study demonstrates that  FUS-mediated BBBD can increase the delivery of panobinostat to an orthotopic DMG  tumor, providing a strong therapeutic effect and increased survival.

OBJECTIVE: To report long-term  data on patient satisfaction and quality of life after MRgFUS thalamotomy for  TPPD. METHODS: In a retrospective study of patients who underwent MRgFUS  thalamotomy for TPPD at our institution between 2015 and 2022, a patient survey  was administered to collect self-reported measures of tremor improvement,  recurrence, Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and side effects.  Patient demographics, FUS parameters, and lesion characteristics were analyzed.  RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were included with a median follow-up of 16  months. Immediate tremor improvement was achieved in 96% of patients. Sustained  improvement was achieved in 63% of patients at last follow-up. Complete tremor  recurrence to baseline occurred for 17% of patients. Life quality improvement  denoted by a PGIC of 1 to 2 was reported by 69% of patients. Long-term side  effects were reported by 38% of patients and were mostly mild. Performing a  secondary anteromedial lesion to target the ventralis oralis anterior/posterior  nucleus was associated with higher rates of speech-related side effects (56% vs  12%), without significant improvement in tremor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Patient  satisfaction with FUS thalamotomy for tremor-predominant PD was very high, even  at longer term.

FUS-BBBO is also capable of modulating the  neuroimmune system, further qualifying its therapeutic potential for  neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Natural aging and AD  impose significant strain on the brain and particularly the BBB, modifying its  structure and subsequently, its functionality. The emerging focus on treating  neurodegenerative diseases with FUS-BBBO necessitates an investigation into the  extent that age and AD affect the BBB's response to FUS. FUS-BBBO was performed  with a 1.5-MHz, geometrically focused transducer operated at 450 kPa and paired  with a bolus microbubble injection of 8 × 10(8) μB/mL. Here we quantify the BBBO,  BBB closing (BBBC) timeline, and BBB permeability (BBBP) following FUS-BBBO in  male mice with and without AD pathology, aged 10 weeks, one year, or two years.  The data presented herein indicates that natural aging and AD pathology may  increase initial BBBO volume by up to 34.4% and 40.7% respectively, extend BBBC  timeline by up to 1.3 and 1.5 days respectively, and increase BBBP as measured by  average K(trans) values up to 80% and 86.1% respectively in male mice. This  characterization of the BBB response to FUS-BBBO with age and AD further  clarifies the nature and extent of the functional impact of these factors and may  offer new considerations for planning FUS-BBBO interventions in aged and AD  populations.","2023-04-25","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","6757","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

Radiotherapy is considered the most important among such  treatments, but conventional radiotherapy alone and concurrent chemoradiotherapy  do not achieve high cure rates. As a radiosensitization strategy, intratumoral  injection of hydrogen peroxide before radiation has been investigated, and high  local control rates (75-97%) were reported. The authors treated 45 patients with  whole-breast radiotherapy, followed by stereotactic or intensity-modulated  radiotherapy boost, with or without a radiosensitization strategy employing  either hydrogen peroxide injection or hyperthermia plus oral  tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium. Stages were 0-I in 23 patients, II in 19,  and III in 3. Clinical and cosmetic outcomes were good, with 5-year overall,  progression-free, and local recurrence-free survival rates of 97, 86, and 88%,  respectively. Trials of carbon ion radiotherapy are ongoing, with promising  interim results. Radiofrequency ablation, focused ultrasound, and other  image-guided ablation treatments yielded complete ablation rates of 20-100%  (mostly ≥70%), but long-term cure rates remain unclear.

Owing to its small molecular  weight, clear mechanical gating mechanism, and nanopore forming ability upon  opening, accumulating studies are implemented in regulating cell function by  activating mechanosensitive channel of large conductance in mammalian cells. This  study aimed to investigate the potentials of mechanosensitive channel of large  conductance as a nanomedicine and a mechano-inducer in non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) A549 cells from the view of molecular pathways and acoustics. The stable  cytoplasmic vacuolization model about NSCLC A549 cells was established via the  targeted expression of modified mechanosensitive channel of large conductance  channels in different subcellular organelles. Subsequent morphological changes in  cellular component and expression levels of cell death markers are analyzed by  confocal imaging and western blots. The permeability of mitochondrial inner  membrane (MIM) exhibited a vital role in cytoplasmic vacuolization formation.  Furthermore, mechanosensitive channel of large conductance channel can be  activated by low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) in A549 cells, and the  suppression of A549 tumors in vivo was achieved by LIFU with sound pressure as  low as 0.053 MPa. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying  non-apoptotic cell death, and validate the nanochannel-based non-invasive  ultrasonic strategy for cancer therapy.","2023","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1130563","","","11","","Front Chem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Wen, Wang, Zhu, Guo, Qian, Zhu, Yang, Qiu, Li, Huang, Jiang, Tan, Zheng, Shu and Li.","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36936526  PMCID: PMC10014542","","","","MscL; cytoplasmic vacuolization; low intensity focused ultrasound; mitochondrial permeability; nanopore","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To ensure no adverse heating events occur with liFUS modulation in a non-invasive  manner, we perform initial work in swine to show that magnetic resonance  thermometry imaging (MRTI) is capable of measuring <2.0 °C changes at the L5 DRG.  Further, we show that our device can be constructed in an MR-compatible fashion  to minimize artifact. METHODS: Three MRTI techniques (referenceless, corrected  proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS), and PRFS) were applied to assess  accuracy of detecting thermal changes at the L5 DRG in unheated euthanized swine.  A region of interest (ROI) that includes the L5 DRG was delineated, within which  MRTI temperature changes were spatially averaged (ground truth 0 °C). In separate  experiments with phantoms, B0 field-inhomogeneity, RF transmit (B1+) and fast  gradient echo (fSPGR) magnitude images were acquired to downselect liFUS device  materials that produce the least MRI artifacts. RESULTS: Referenceless, corrected  PRFS, and PRFS MRTI resulted in temperature measurements of 0.8 ± 1.1 °C,  1.1 ± 1.3 °C and 5.2 ± 5 °C, respectively. Both materials caused B0 perturbation  but minimal B1+ and MRTI artifacts. The presence of imaging artifacts did not  preclude thermal imaging of the region. SIGNIFICANCE: We provide preliminary data  suggesting that referenceless MRTI can adequately detect small thermal changes at  the DRG that may occur with neuromodulation, which is one of the first steps in  creating a table of safe parameters for liFUS therapy in humans.","2023-09","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","35-39","","","101","","Magn Reson Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: We  conducted a systematic review and a Bayesian network meta-analysis, examining  studies using thermal ablation interventions in the treatment of benign nodular  thyroid disease (PROSPERO CRD42022367680). The primary endpoints included volume  reduction rate (VRR), and symptomatic score and cosmetic score improvement.  Secondary endpoints included vocal disturbances, laryngeal nerve palsy,  hypothyroidism, and nodular regrowth (defined by increased nodular volume of >50%  for thermal ablation or new nodules arising in remaining thyroid tissue  conventional surgery [CS]). Results: We included 16 studies (3 randomized  controlled trials [RCTs] and 13 comparative case series), describing  radiofrequency ablation (RFA), laser ablation (LA), microwave ablation (MWA),  high-intensity focus ultrasound (HIFU), and CS, respectively. The review included  data from 4112 patients followed for a mean of 11.9 months. Meta-analyses showed  no significant differences among RFA, LA, MWA, HIFU, and CS regarding any of the  primary endpoints of VRR, symptomatic score, and cosmetic score. In examining the  surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) ranking, CS (SUCRA, 98.49), LA  (SUCRA, 51.58), and MWA (SUCRA, 57.0) were identified as the three interventions  that were most likely to result in the largest VRR, symptomatic and cosmetic  score reduction. RFA, relative risk (RR) 0.19 [95% credibility interval (CI):  0.06 to 0.48], LA RR 0.23 [CI: 0.06 to 0.79], and MWA RR 0.25 [CI: 0.09 to 0.60]  were associated with the greatest reduction in risk for postintervention vocal  complications compared with CS, with RFA (SUCRA, 61.62) being ranked as the  highest in safety. RFA RR 0.05 [CI: 0.00 to 0.40] and MWA RR 0.16 [CI: 0.02 to  0.73] were associated with a reduced risk of transient laryngeal nerve injury  compared with CS.

METHODS: The thalamus and hypothalamus of wild-type mice were sonicated with a  continuous-wave, 2 MHz FUS transducer at pressures of 425 and 850 kPa for 60  seconds. Cardiac and respiratory rates were monitored as signs of autonomic  nervous activity. FUS-induced changes in autonomic activity were compared to FUS  targeted to a spatially-distant motor region and to laser-induced heating.  RESULTS: FUS delivered to the primary target over the thalamus and hypothalamus  at 850 kPa reversibly increased the respiratory rate by 6.5±3.2 breaths per  minute and decreased the heart rate by 3.2±1.8 beats per minute. No significant  changes occurred in this region at 425 kPa or when targeting the motor regions at  850 kPa. Laser heating with the same temperature rise profile produced by 850 kPa  sonication resulted in cardiorespiratory modulation similar to that of FUS.  CONCLUSIONS: FUS is capable of reversibly and non-invasively modulating  cardiorespiratory activity in mice. Localized changes in temperature may  constitute the main cause for this activity, though further investigation is  warranted into the distinct and complementary mechanisms of mechanically- and  thermally-induced FUS neuromodulation. Close monitoring of vital signs during FUS  neuromodulation may be warranted to monitor systemic responses to stimulation.","2024-03","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","332-340","","3","50","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Multimodal imaging techniques are expected to combine the high  spatial resolution (mm level) of focused ultrasound (FUS) with the high temporal  resolution (ms level) of EEG. The technique must be performed under the premise  that ultrasound stimulation does not affect neuronal firing, and there is an  urgent need to determine the threshold of this ultrasound stimulation parameter.  METHODS: In this paper, the subthalamic nucleus neuronal firing model and the  bilayer sonophore model are combined to numerically simulate the neuronal firing  rhythm under the conditions of different stimulation parameters. The correlation  and frequency differences of neuronal firing rhythms with and without ultrasound  stimulation were compared and used as an index to evaluate the degree of change,  and the final range of effective threshold parameters for ultrasound stimulation  of neurons but not inducing neuronal firing was obtained. RESULTS: The results  showed that the correlation of neuronal firing rhythms in both conditions with  and without stimulation decreased and the frequency difference increased with  increasing ultrasound parameters such as duty cycle, intensity, center frequency  and pulse repetition frequency. CONCLUSION: An effective range of stimulation  threshold parameters can be obtained based on the correlation coefficients and  frequency difference matrices under different parameter combinations.

Transcranial application of focused ultrasound  (FUS) has been shown to promote localized cerebrospinal fluid solute uptake into  the brain parenchyma; however, its effects on the transport and clearance of  interstitial solutes remain unknown. We demonstrate that pulsed application of  low-intensity FUS to the rat brain enhances the transport of intracortically  injected fluorescent tracers (ovalbumin and high molecular-weight dextran),  yielding greater parenchymal tracer volume distribution compared to the  unsonicated control group (ovalbumin by 40.1% and dextran by 34.6%). Furthermore,  FUS promoted the drainage of injected interstitial ovalbumin to both superficial  and deep cervical lymph nodes (cLNs) ipsilateral to sonication, with 78.3% higher  drainage observed in the superficial cLNs compared to the non-sonicated  hemisphere. The application of FUS increased the level of solute transport  visible from the dorsal brain surface, with ~ 43% greater area and ~ 19% higher  fluorescence intensity than the unsonicated group, especially in the pial surface  ipsilateral to sonication. The sonication did not elicit tissue-level neuronal  excitation, measured by an electroencephalogram, nor did it alter the molecular  weight of the tracers. These findings suggest that nonthermal transcranial FUS  can enhance advective transport of interstitial solutes and their subsequent  removal in a completely non-invasive fashion, offering its potential  non-pharmacological utility in facilitating clearance of waste from the brain.","2023-07-31","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","12339","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

However, in the treatment of liver cancer,  because the tumor is located deep within the liver tissue, when ultrasound  penetrates the tissue, it will inevitably produce sound energy attenuation. This  attenuation limits the reliability of HIFU treatment, reduce the efficacy of  HIFU, and increase the risk of tumor recurrence. METHODS: Cationic microbubbles  (CMB) were successfully linked with GPC3 and HSV-TK plasmids, and targeted  gene-carrying CMB were successfully constructed. Moreover, the gene-targeted  cation microbubbles had suitable targeting and can specifically bind with liver  cancer cells. RESULTS: The HSV-TK transfection efficiency was high and had a  significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation and invasion of liver cancer  cells. After the gene-carrying cation microbubbles entered the animal body, they  had a great targeting effect in vivo. They transfected the target genes into  liver cancer cells, and the HSV-TK/GCV system initiated cell death, demonstrating  that these targeted microbubbles, enhanced HIFU treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,  CMB combined with a GPC3 antibody and HSV-TK plasmid can target residual  subcutaneous liver tumor cells under the guidance of GPC3 antibody, and kill  residual subcutaneous liver tumor cells under the action of ultrasound, thus  enhancing the therapeutic effect of HIFU on liver cancer.","2024-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","95-107","","1","43","","J Ultrasound Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 37815381","","","","*Liver Neoplasms/therapy; *Microbubbles; Animals; Cations; HIFU; HSV-TK gene; Lipids; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Reproducibility of Results; nano-targeted cationic lipid microbubbles; residual liver cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This is a  retrospective, multicentre study including patients with low- or  intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer treated with Focal one HIFU between  November 2014 and December 2019. The primary endpoint was the retreatment rate  and subgroup analyses were performed to identify predictive factors of  retreatment. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-seven patients were included with a  median follow-up of 25.5 months. Seventy percent of patients had clinical stage  T2, 64% had an ISUP score of 2 or 3 on initial biopsies and 38% were treated with  hemi-ablation. Follow-up biopsies were performed in 76.6% of patients during  follow-up with 21.8% having clinically significant cancers. The retreatment rate  at 24 months was 37.2%, with positive biopsies being the primary criterion for  retreatment. Patients with a PSA>8ng/mL had a significantly higher retreatment  rate. Finally, morbidity remained acceptable with 5.8% of patients requiring  reoperation for complications and 21% for de novo erectile dysfunction.

The patient underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy targeting the right ventral  intermediate nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus to treat the left hand. There was  almost complete resolution of his left-hand tremor immediately following MRgFUS.  There were no side effects. The patient continues to show excellent tremor  control at 90-day follow-up and remains free from side effects.

METHODS: A total  of 105 patients with desmoid fibromatosis (79 females, 26 males; 35 ± 14 years)  were treated with MRgFUS between 2011 and 2021 in three centers. Total and viable  tumors were evaluated per patient at last follow-up after treatment. Response and  progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed with (modified) response evaluation  criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v.1.1 and mRECIST). Change in Numerical Rating  Scale (NRS) pain and 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores were  compared. Treatment-related adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: The median  initial tumor volume was 114 mL (IQR 314 mL). After MRgFUS, median total and  viable tumor volume decreased to 51 mL (95% CI: 30-71 mL, n = 101, p < 0.0001)  and 29 mL (95% CI: 17-57 mL, n = 88, p < 0.0001), respectively, at last follow-up  (median: 15 months, 95% CI: 11-20 months). Based on total tumor measurements  (RECIST), 86% (95% CI: 75-93%) had at least stable disease or better at last  follow-up, but 50% (95% CI: 38-62%) of remaining viable nodules (mRECIST)  progressed within the tumor. Median PFS was reached at 17 and 13 months for total  and viable tumors, respectively. NRS decreased from 6 (IQR 3) to 3 (IQR 4) (p <  0.001). SF-36 scores improved (physical health (41 (IQR 15) to 46 (IQR 12); p =  0.05, and mental health (49 (IQR 17) to 53 (IQR 9); p = 0.02)).

They are image-guided ablation surgery with focused ultrasound,  microwave, and radiofrequency ablations that are becoming tested and used in some  medical centers or hospitals. Nevertheless, these image-guided ablation surgeries  involve thermal ablation to the fibroids, which might lead to thermal injury to  the surrounding tissues, for example, nerve injury, vessel injury, and skin burn  due to heat diffusion. A new technology - irreversible electroporation (IRE) - is  a new paradigm for treating solid tumors. This nonthermal ablation process does  not induce high temperatures when treating cancers or solid tumors. The IRE  treatment may soon be used for treating fibroids or other solid tumors. In a few  clinical trials, IRE is currently used in experimental studies for treating  gynecological cancers.

To understand the  mechanisms behind this treatment, it is important to evaluate the contribution of  FUS without microbubbles on increased nanoparticle penetration and transport in  the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM). A composite agarose hydrogel was made to  model the porous structure, the acoustic attenuation and the hydraulic  conductivity of the tumor ECM. Single-particle tracking was used as a novel  method to monitor nanoparticle dynamics in the hydrogel during FUS exposure. FUS  exposure at 1 MHz and 1 MPa was performed to detect any increase in nanoparticle  diffusion or particle streaming at acoustic parameters relevant for FUS in  combination with microbubbles. Results were compared to a model of acoustic  streaming. The nanoparticles displayed anomalous diffusion in the hydrogel, and  FUS with a duty cycle of 20% increased the nanoparticle diffusion coefficient by  23%. No increase in diffusion was found for lower duty cycles. FUS displaced the  hydrogel itself at duty cycles above 10%; however, acoustic streaming was found  to be negligible. In conclusion, pulsed FUS alone cannot explain the enhanced  penetration of nanoparticles seen when using FUS and microbubbles for  nanoparticle delivery, but it could be used as a tool to enhance diffusion of  particles in the tumor ECM.","2023-09-22","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","10","9","","Gels","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37888344  PMCID: PMC10606116","","","","acoustic radiation force (ARF); drug delivery; extracellular matrix (ECM) model; focused ultrasound (FUS); hydrogel; nanoparticles; single-particle tracking (SPT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, HIFU surgery has its intrinsic limitation in completely ablating tumors,  leading to residual tumor tissue. Furthermore, the severely hypoxic environment  ensuring after surgery can exacerbate the unrestricted proliferation and  metabolism of residual tumor cells, leading to tumor recurrence and metastasis.  To address these limitations, a versatile HIFU-specific metal-organic framework  nanosystem (called ADMOFs) is developed by coordinating hypoxia-activated prodrug  AQ4N, Mn(2+) , and DOX based on the postoperative response to changes in the  tumor microenvironment. ADMOFs loaded with AQ4N/Mn(2+) exhibited remarkable  tumor-targeting behavior in vivo and enhanced photoacoustic/magnetic resonance  imaging effects, enabling more accurate guidance for HIFU surgery. After surgery,  the ADMOFs exploited the severely hypoxic tumor environment induced by HIFU,  overcoming hypoxia-associated drug resistance, and inducing immunogenic cell  death. Finally, it effectively inhibited tumor growth and eliminated lung  metastasis. Transcriptome studies revealed that this strategy significantly  up-regulated genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, and HIF-1 signaling pathway  while downregulating genes related to tumor proliferation and metastasis. These  findings suggest that combining hypoxia-activated chemo-immunotherapy with HIFU  is a promising strategy for enhancing cancer theranostics.","2023-12-10","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","e2306338","","","","","Small","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 38072817","","","","HIFU; hypoxia-activated; image-guided; metal-organic framework; synergistic therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurate placement of an  acoustic focus to a target region of the brain is crucial during tFUS treatment;  however, the distortion of acoustic wave propagation through the intact skull  casts challenges. High-resolution numerical simulation allows for monitoring of  the acoustic pressure field in the cranium but also demands extensive  computational loads. In this study, we adopt a super-resolution residual network  technique based on a deep convolution to enhance the prediction quality of the  FUS acoustic pressure field in the targeted brain regions. METHODS: The training  dataset was acquired by numerical simulations performed at low-(1.0 mm) and  high-resolutions (0.5mm) on three ex vivo human calvariae. Five different  super-resolution (SR) network models were trained by using a multivariable  dataset in 3D, which incorporated information on the acoustic pressure field,  wave velocity, and localized skull computed tomography (CT) images. RESULTS: The  accuracy of 80.87±4.50% in predicting the focal volume with a substantial  improvement of 86.91% in computational cost compared to the conventional  high-resolution numerical simulation was achieved. The results suggest that the  method can greatly reduce the simulation time without sacrificing accuracy and  improve the accuracy further with the use of additional inputs. CONCLUSIONS: In  this research, we developed multivariable-incorporating SR neural networks for  transcranial focused ultrasound simulation. Our super-resolution technique may  contribute to promoting the safety and efficacy of tFUS-mediated NIBS by  providing on-site feedback information on the intracranial pressure field to the  operator.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","107591","","","237","","Comput Methods Programs Biomed","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Because of  the occurrence of shock scattering phenomenon during BH process, the treatment  accuracy of BH is, however, somewhat limited. To induce more localised and  selective tissue destruction, the concept of pressure modulation has recently  been proposed in our previous in vitro tissue phantom study. The aim of the  present study was therefore to investigate whether this newly developed  histotripsy approach termed pressure-modulated shockwave histotripsy (PSH) can be  used to induce localised mechanical tissue fractionation in in vivo animal model.  METHODS: In the present study, 8 Sprague Dawley rats underwent the PSH treatment  and were sacrificed immediately after the exposure for morphological and  histological analyses (paraffin embedded liver tissue sections were stained with  H&E and MT). Partially exteriorised rat's left lateral liver lobe in vivo was  exposed to a 2.0 MHz HIFU transducer with peak positive (P (+)) and negative (P  (-)) pressures of 89.1 MPa and -14.6 MPa, a pulse length of 5 to 34 ms, a  pressure modulation time at 4 ms where P (+) and P (-) decreased to 29.9 MPa and  - 9.6 MPa, a pulse repetition frequency of 1 Hz, a duty cycle of 1% and number of  pulses of 1 to 20. Three lesions were produced on each animal. For comparison,  the same exposure condition but no pressure modulation was also employed to  create a number of lesions in the liver. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Experimental  results showed that a partial mechanical destruction of liver tissue in the form  of an oval in the absence of thermal damage was clearly observed at the HIFU  focus after the PSH exposure. With a single pulse length of 7 ms, a PSH lesion  created in the liver was measured to be a length of 1.04 ± 0.04 mm and a width of  0.87 ± 0.21 mm which was 2.37 times in length (p = 0.027) and 1.35 times in width  (p = 0.1295) smaller than a lesion produced by no pressure modulation approach  (e.g., BH). It was also observed that the length of a PSH lesion gradually grew  towards the opposite direction to the HIFU source along the axial direction with  the PSH pulse length, eventually leading to the generation of an elongated lesion  in the liver. In addition, our experimental results demonstrated the feasibility  of inducing partial decellularisation effect where liver tissue was partially  destructed with intact extracellular matrix (i.e., intact fibrillar collagen)  with the shortest PSH pulse length.

To  achieve maximum efficiency, parallel control of microlitre droplets using  automated techniques is essential. Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD), which  manipulates droplets using the imbalance of wetting on a substrate, is the most  widely employed method. However, EWOD is limited in its capability to make  droplets detach from the substrate (jumping), which hinders throughput and device  integration. Here, we propose a novel microfluidic system based on focused  ultrasound passing through a hydrophobic mesh with droplets resting on top. A  phased array dynamically creates foci to manipulate droplets of up to 300 μL.  This platform offers a jump height of up to 10 cm, a 27-fold improvement over  conventional EWOD systems. In addition, droplets can be merged or split by  pushing them against a hydrophobic knife. We demonstrate Suzuki-Miyaura  cross-coupling using our platform, showing its potential for a wide range of  chemical experiments. Biofouling in our system was lower than in conventional  EWOD, demonstrating its high suitability for biological experiments. Focused  ultrasound allows the manipulation of both solid and liquid targets.

Focused ultrasound (FUS) and  microbubbles (MBs) have been shown to cause BBB opening, allowing larger  chemotherapeutics to enter the parenchyma. Panobinostat is an example of a  promising in vitro agent in DIPG with poor clinical efficacy due to low BBB  penetrance. In this study, we hypothesized that using FUS to disrupt the BBB  allows higher concentrations of panobinostat to accumulate in the tumor,  providing a therapeutic effect. METHODS: Mice were orthotopically injected with a  patient-derived diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cell line, BT245. MRI was used to  guide FUS/MB (1.5 MHz, 0.615 MPa peak negative pressure, 1 Hz pulse repetition  frequency, 10-ms pulse length, 3 min treatment time)/(25 µL/kg, i.v.) targeting  to the tumor location. RESULTS: In animals receiving panobinostat (10 mg/kg,  i.p.) in combination with FUS/MB, a 3-fold increase in tumor panobinostat  concentration was observed, without significant increase of the drug in the  forebrain. In mice receiving 3 weekly treatments, the combination of panobinostat  and FUS/MB led to a 71% reduction of tumor volumes (P = .01). Furthermore, we  showed the first survival benefit from FUS/MB improved delivery increasing the  mean survival from 21 to 31 days (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates  that FUS-mediated BBB disruption can increase the delivery of panobinostat to an  orthotopic DMG tumor, providing a strong therapeutic effect and increased  survival.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","vdad111","","1","5","","Neurooncol Adv","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2023.

Even when recognized and  adequately treated, in over a third of patients with these conditions the  response to first-line pharmacological and psychotherapeutic measures is not  satisfactory. After more assertive measures including pharmacological  augmentation (and in the case of depression, transcranial magnetic stimulation,  electroconvulsive therapy, or treatment with ketamine or esketamine), a  significant number of individuals remain severely symptomatic. In these persons,  different ablation and deep-brain stimulation (DBS) psychosurgical techniques  have been employed. However, apart from the cost and potential morbidity  associated with surgery, on average only about half of patients show adequate  response, which limits the widespread application of these potentially  life-saving interventions. Possible reasons are considered for the wide variation  in outcomes across different series of patients with MDD or OCD exposed to  ablative or DBS psychosurgery, including interindividual anatomical and  etiological variability. Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is an emerging  technique that holds promise in its ability to achieve anatomically  circumscribed, noninvasive, and reversible neuromodulation of deep brain  structures. A possible role for LIFU in the personalized presurgical definition  of neuromodulation targets in the individual patient is discussed, including a  proposed roadmap for clinical trials addressed at testing whether this technique  can help to improve psychosurgical outcomes.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","100100","","","37-38","","Pers Med Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36969502  PMCID: PMC10034711","","","","Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound; Major Depressive Disorder; Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Psychosurgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated MRgFUS as a clinically  translatable treatment modality to non-invasively disrupt in vivo porcine  tendons. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In vivo Achilles tendons (n = 28) from 15-20kg  Yorkshire pigs (n = 16) were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups of 600, 900,  1200 and 1500 J. Pretreatment range of motion (ROM) of the ankle joint was  measured with the animal under general anesthesia. Following MRgFUS treatment,  success of tendon rupture, ROM increase, temperature, thermal dosage, skin burn,  and histology analyses were performed. RESULTS: Rupture success was found to be  29%, 86%, 100% and 100% for treatment energies of 600, 900, 1200 and 1500 J  respectfully. ROM difference at 90(°) flexion showed a statistically significant  change in ROM between 900 J and 1200 J from 16(°) to 27(°). There was no  statistical significance between other groups, but there was an increase in ROM  as more energy was delivered in the treatment. For each of the respective  treatment groups, the maximal temperatures were 58.4 °C, 63.3 °C, 67.6 °C, and  69.9 °C.

OBJECTIVE:  To evaluate the treatment decision satisfaction and regret among patients who  underwent FT for PCa with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) or  cryoablation (CRYO). DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We identified consecutive  patients who underwent HIFU or CRYO FT as the primary treatment for localized PCa  at three US institutions. A survey with validated questionnaires, including the  five-question Decision Regret Scale (DRS), International Prostate Symptom Score  (IPSS), and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), was mailed to the  patients. The regret score was calculated based on the five items of the DRS, and  regret was defined as a DRS score of >25. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS: Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess the  predictors of treatment decision regret. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of 236  patients, 143 (61%) responded to the survey. Baseline characteristics were  similar between responders and nonresponders. During a median (interquartile  range) follow-up of 43 (26-68) mo, the treatment decision regret rate was 19.6%.  On a multivariable analysis, higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at nadir  after FT (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2, p = 0.009),  presence of PCa on follow-up biopsy (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.5-10.6, p = 0.006), higher  post-FT IPSS (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.37, p = 0.03), and newly diagnosed impotence  (OR 6.67, 95% CI 1.57-27, p = 0.03) were independent predictors of treatment  regret. The type of energy treatment (HIFU/CRYO) was not a predictor of  regret/satisfaction. Limitations include retrospective abstraction. CONCLUSIONS:  FT for localized PCa is well accepted by the patients, with a low regret rate.  Higher PSA at nadir, presence of cancer on follow-up biopsy, bothersome  postoperative urinary symptoms, and impotence after FT were independent  predictors of treatment decision regret. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we  looked at the factors affecting satisfaction and regret in patients with prostate  cancer undergoing focal therapy. We found that focal therapy is well accepted by  the patients, while presence of cancer on follow-up biopsy as well as bothersome  urinary symptoms and sexual dysfunction can predict treatment decision regret.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","10-16","","","50","","Eur Urol Open Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 The Authors.","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 37101771  PMCID: PMC10123415","","","","Focal therapy; Outcome; Patient satisfaction; Prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of thermal lesion  detection using Nakagami imaging. METHODS: Simulations were conducted to explore  and quantify the influence of the bubbles and the subresolvable effect at the  boundary of the thermal lesion on thermal lesion detection. The thermal ablation  experiments were conducted in phantom and porcine liver ex vivo. RESULTS: In the  simulation, the estimated lateral and axial size of the thermal lesion in the  Nakagami image was 4.91 and 4.79 mm, close to the actual size (5 × 5 mm). The  simulation results indicated that the subresolvable region in high-intensity  focused ultrasound treatment thermal ablation mainly happened at the boundary  between bubbles and the untreated region and does not affect the accuracy of  thermal lesion detection. The accurate detection of the thermal lesion using  Nakagami imaging mainly depends on bubbles and thermal lesion characterization.  Our thermal ablation experiments confirmed that Nakagami imaging has the ability  to accurately identify thermal lesions from bubbles. CONCLUSION: The  subresolvable effect is helpful for thermal lesion identification, and precision  is related to the Nakagami values chosen for boundary division in Nakagami  imaging. Therefore, Nakagami imaging is a promising method for accurately  evaluating thermal lesions. Further studies in vivo and in clinical settings will  be needed to explore its potential applications.","2023-07","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1575-1585","","7","49","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Alcohol ablation was one of the initial methods used for the treatment  of liver lesions. It was surpassed by thermal ablation which has played a big  role in the therapeutic arsenal for primary and metastatic liver tumors. However,  thermal ablation has several shortcomings and limitations that prompted the  development of alternative technologies including electroporation and  histotripsy. Percutaneous alcohol injection in the liver lesion leads to  dehydration and coagulative necrosis. This technology is limited to the lesion  with relative sparing of the surrounding tissue, making it safe to use adjacent  to sensitive structures. Electroporation utilizes short high-voltage pulses to  permeabilize the cell membrane and can result in cell death dependent on the  threshold reached. It can effectively target the tumor margins and has lower  damage rates to surrounding structures due to the short pulse duration.  Histotripsy is a novel technology, and although the first human trial was just  completed, its results are encouraging, given the sharp demarcation of the  targeted tissue, lack of thermal damage, and potential for immunomodulation of  the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we discuss these techniques, their uses, and  overall clinical benefit.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","497-504","","6","40","","Semin Intervent Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","Thieme.

Monitoring elasticity in addition to  temperature changes may help in ensuring the efficacy and the accuracy of HIFU  therapies. For this purpose, an MR-SSI method has been developed where the  ultrasonic transducer is used for both mechanical wave generation and thermal  ablation. Transient quasi-planar shear waves are generated using the acoustic  radiation force, and their propagation is monitored in motion-sensitized phase MR  images. Using a single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar-imaging sequence, MR images  can be acquired at a sufficiently high temporal resolution to provide an update  of PRFS thermometry and MR-SSI elastography maps in real time.Main results.The  proposed method was first validated on a calibrated elasticity phantom, in which  both the possibility to detect inclusions with different stiffness and  repeatability were demonstrated. The standard deviation between the 8 performed  measurements was 2% on the background of the phantom and 11%, at most, on the  inclusions. A second experiment consisted in performing a HIFU heating in a  gelatin phantom. The temperature increase was estimated to be 9 °C and the shear  modulus was found to decrease from 2.9 to 1.8 kPa, reflecting the gel softening  around the HIFU focus, whereas it remained steady in non-heated  areas.Significance.The proposed MR-SSI technique allows monitoring HIFU ablations  using thermometry and elastography simultaneously, without the need for an  additional external mechanical exciter such as those used in MR elastography.","2023-01-24","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","3","68","","Phys Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 36595333","","","","*Elasticity Imaging Techniques/methods; *Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *Thermometry/methods; Elasticity; HIFU therapy; MR elastography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Ultrasonics; interventional MRI; supersonic shear wave; therapy monitoring; thermal ablation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The thermoablation of subserosal UFs was a statistically significant  risk factor of perioperative treatment discontinuation (OR 4.62, CI 95%  2.04-10.56), while the therapy of intramural UFs considerably decreased the risk  (OR 0.21, CI 95% 0.08-0.51). The volume of the targeted UF was negatively  correlated with the risk of discontinuation (OR 0.991, CI 95% 0.986-0.996).  Augmentation with oxytocin, but not misoprostol, during the procedure  significantly decreased the risk of potential discontinuation (OR 0.15, CI 95%  0.045-0.387, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although the discontinuation rate seems to  be relatively low, further prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm  our results. The establishment of particular eligibility criteria for the  treatment is a crucial issue in this area. Resigning from the procedure in cases  at a high risk of discontinuation might increase patient safety and shorten the  time to introduce the most appropriate therapy.","2023-09-16","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","18","12","","J Clin Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 37762939  PMCID: PMC10531787","","","","failure rate; leiomyoma; magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound; treatment discontinuation; uterine fibroid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided HIFU (EUS-HIFU) using  mechanical effects would have potential benefits, including precise detection of  target lesions and enhance drug delivery. The aim of this study is to develop  EUS-HIFU device and to prove our concept in porcine model using a locally  injected phase change nano droplet (PCND) as the sensitizer. METHOD: A  phospholipid PCND contained volatile perfluoro-carbon liquids. The prototype HIFU  apparatus comprised a small (20 × 20 mm) transducer with center frequency of  2.1 MHz, attachable to a linear EUS transducer. Under general anesthetic, a  single porcine received EUS-guided injection of PCND. The HIFU transducer was  placed laparotomically in the stomach, and the liver was ablated through the  gastric wall. RESULTS: PCND was injected successfully and a distinct lesion was  generated at the HIFU transducer focus only in injected areas that received HIFU  exposure at 4.7 kW/cm(2) at a duty cycle of 5 % (mean temporal intensity,  0.245 kW/cm(2)) for 30 s. The generated lesions were mechanically fractionated in  macroscopic view. CONCLUSION: The concept of transluminal HIFU ablation using  novel EUS-HIFU system was proved in a porcine animal model. This novel treatment  system has great potential for future cancer treatment although further  investigation in more animals and different organs are warranted.","2024-02","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","88-92","","1","24","","Pancreatology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2023 IAP and EPC.

METHODS: This is a prospective study including patients  with low to intermediate-risk PCa treated with HIFU by Focal One(®) device from  11/2018 to 3/2020. Before the treatment all patients underwent mp-magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequent MRI/transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion  and standard biopsy. Patients were stratified according to the type of ablation:  total, hemi- or focal ablation. Functional data (IPSS, Quality of Life [QoL],  IIEF-5, maximum flow [Qmax] and post void residual [PVR] at flowmetry) were  assessed preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Moreover,  the urinary symptoms reported by patients at IPSS questionnaire were divided in  ""irritative"" and ""obstructive"" and compared. RESULTS: One hundred patients were  enrolled. Median prostate volume and lesion diameter were 46 (IQR 25-75) mL and  10 (IQR 6-13) mm. 15, 50 and 35 patients underwent total, hemi- and focal  ablation, respectively. No differences were found between them except for  operative time (lower in the focal group, P<0.01). Significant lower incidence of  irritative symptoms was identified in the focal group compared to the others  (P<0.05 at 1 and 3 months of follow-up). No differences were found among the  baseline status and the postoperative assessment in terms of obstructive IPSS  items, IIEF-5, QoL, Qmax and PVR (all P value>0.05).

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to report on the outcomes  between different tremor syndromes after a unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy.  METHODS: A total of 66 patients underwent a unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy for  tremor between November 2018 and May 2020 at St Vincent's Hospital Sydney. Each  patient's tremor syndrome was classified prior to treatment. Clinical  assessments, including the hand tremor score (HTS) and Quality of Life in  Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST), were performed at baseline and predefined  intervals to 36 months. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients, comprising 30 essential  tremor (ET), 24 dystonic tremor (DT), and 9 Parkinson's disease tremor (PDT)  patients, returned for at least one follow-up. In the ET patients, at 24 months  there was a 61% improvement in HTS and 50% improvement in QUEST compared to  baseline. This is in comparison to PDT patients, where an initial benefit in HTS  and QUEST was observed, which waned at each follow-up, remaining significant only  up until 12 months. In the DT patients, similar results were observed to the ET  patients: at 24 months there was a 61% improvement in HTS and 43% improvement in  QUEST compared to baseline. CONCLUSION: These results support the use of  unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy for the treatment of DT, which appears to have a  similar expected outcome to patients diagnosed with ET.

Microbubble agents have also been used in combination with sonication exposures.  These require temperature feedback and monitoring to prevent unstable cavitation  and prevent excess tissue heating. Previous work has utilized lower power and  pressure to oscillate microbubbles and transfer energy to endothelial cells in  the absence of thermally induced damage that can radiosensitize tumors. This work  investigated whether reduced acoustic power and pressure on a commercial  available MR-integrated HIFU system could result in enhanced radiation-induced  tumor response after exposure to ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles  (USMB) therapy. A commercially available MR-integrated HIFU system was used with  a hyperthermia system calibration provided by the manufacturer. The ultrasound  transducer was calibrated to reach a peak negative pressure of - 750 kPa. Thirty  male New Zealand white rabbits bearing human derived PC3 tumors were grouped to  receive no treatment, 14 min of USMB, 8 Gy of radiation in a separate irradiation  cabinet, or combined treatments. In vivo temperature changes were collected using  MR thermometry at the tumor center and far-field muscle region. Tissues specimens  were collected 24 h post radiation therapy. Tumor cell death was measured and  compared to untreated controls through hematoxylin and eosin staining and  immunohistochemical analysis. The desired peak negative pressure of - 750 kPa  used for previous USMB occurred at approximately an input power of 5 W.  Temperature changes were limited to under 4 °C in ten of twelve rabbits  monitored. The median temperature in the far-field muscle region of the leg was  2.50 °C for groups receiving USMB alone or in combination with radiation.  Finally, statistically significant tumor cell death was demonstrated using  immunohistochemical analysis in the combined therapy group compared to untreated  controls. A commercial MR-guided therapy HIFU system was able to effectively  treat PC3 tumors in a rabbit model using USMB therapy in combination with  radiation exposures. Future work could find the use of reduced power and pressure  levels in a commercial MR-guided therapy system to mechanically stimulate  microbubbles and damage endothelial cells without requiring high thermal doses to  elicit an antitumor response.","2023-03-18","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","4487","","1","13","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

High-quality evidence regarding the clinical efficacy remains limited. OBJECTIVE:  To assess medium-term oncological efficacy along with patient-reported outcome  measures (PROMs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective  single-center cohort study was performed from 2014 to 2020. Patients with primary  International Society of Urological Pathologists (ISUP) grade group (GG) ≤2 by  combined MRI/TRUS fusion and systematic prostate biopsy and prostate-specific  antigen (PSA) <10 ng/ml were included. INTERVENTION: MRI/TRUS fusion-guided focal  HIFU therapy. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary outcome  was the cancer-free rate of the HIFU-treated lesion by biopsy after 1 yr.  Secondary endpoints included salvage treatment-free survival (STFS),  metastasis-free survival (MFS), overall survival (OS), and PROMs according to  International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement recommendations. RESULTS  AND LIMITATIONS: Fifty patients were included (median [range] age 68 [48-80] yr;  median PSA 6.5 [1.2-9.9] ng/ml; GG 1 54% [n = 27], and GG 2 46% [n = 23]). The  median (range) PSA decrease from baseline to 12 mo was 51% (35.9-72.7%). In  total, 37/50 patients (74%) underwent a 1-yr biopsy. PCa was detected in 23  patients (46%; GG 1 20% [n = 10]; GG >1 26% [n = 13]; infield 40% [n = 20]). At a  median follow-up of 42 (13-73) mo, PCa was detected in 30 men (60%).

However, the complex morphology of the skull hinders scholars from  precisely predicting the acoustic energy transmitted and the region of the brain  impacted during the sonication. This is due to the fact that different ultrasound  frequencies and skull morphology variations greatly affect wave propagation  through the skull. PURPOSE: Although the acoustic properties of human skull have  been studied for tFUS applications, such as tumor ablation using a multielement  phased array, there is no consensus about how to choose a single-element focused  ultrasound (FUS) transducer with a suitable frequency for neuromodulation. There  are interests in exploring the magnitude and dimension of tFUS beam through human  parietal bone for modulating specific brain lobes. Herein, we aim to investigate  the wave propagation of tFUS on human skulls to understand and address the  concerns above. METHODS: Both experimental measurements and numerical modeling  were conducted to investigate the transmission efficiency and beam pattern of  tFUS on five human skulls (C3 and C4 regions) using single-element FUS  transducers with six different frequencies (150-1500 kHz). The degassed skull was  placed in a water tank, and a calibrated hydrophone was utilized to measure  acoustic pressure past it. The cranial computed tomography scan data of each  skull were obtained to derive a high-resolution acoustic model (grid point  spacing: 0.25 mm) in simulations. Meanwhile, we modified the power-law exponent  of acoustic attenuation coefficient to validate numerical modeling and enabled it  to be served as a prediction tool, based on the experimental measurements.  RESULTS: The transmission efficiency and -6 dB beamwidth were evaluated and  compared for various frequencies. An exponential decrease in transmission  efficiency and a logarithmic decrease of -6 dB beamwidth with an increase in  ultrasound frequency were observed. It is found that a >750 kHz ultrasound leads  to a relatively lower tFUS transmission efficiency (<5%), whereas a <350 kHz  ultrasound contributes to a relatively broader beamwidth (>5 mm). Based on these  observations, we further analyzed the dependence of tFUS wave propagation on FUS  transducer aperture size. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully studied tFUS wave  propagation through human skulls at different frequencies experimentally and  numerically. The findings have important implications to predict tFUS wave  propagation for ultrasound neuromodulation in clinical applications, and guide  researchers to develop advanced ultrasound transducers as neural interfaces.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","38-49","","1","50","","Med Phys","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.

Moreover, HIFU  ablation alone may inevitably lead to the presence of residual tumors, which may  cause tumor recurrence and metastasis. Here, we describe a synergistic regimen  combining HIFU facilitation with immunomodulation based on a novel  oxygen-carrying biomimetic perfluorocarbon nanoparticle (M@P-SOP) to stimulate  immunogenic cell death in tumor cells while alleviating immune suppression tumor  microenvironment. METHODS: M@P-SOP was prepared by double emulsion and film  extrusion method. The anticancer and antimetastatic effects of M@P-SOP were  evaluated on a preclinical transplanted 4T1 tumor model by combining HIFU and  immunotherapy. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to clarify the  potential mechanism of HIFU+M@P-SOP and their role in anti-programmed death  ligand-1 (PD-L1) therapy. RESULTS: Guided by photoacoustic/MR/ultrasound (US)  multimodal imaging, M@P-SOP was abundantly enriched in tumor, which greatly  enhanced HIFU's killing of tumor tissue in situ, induced stronger tumor  immunogenic cell death, stimulated dendritic cell maturation and activated CD8(+)  T cells. At the same time, M@P-SOP released oxygen to alleviate the tumor hypoxic  environment, repolarizing the protumor M2-type macrophages into antitumor  M1-type. With concurrent anti-PD-L1 treatment, the antitumor immune response was  further amplified to the whole body, and the growth of mimic distant tumor was  effectively suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings offer a highly promising HIFU  synergist for effectively ameliorating acoustic and hypoxia environment,  eventually inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis by stimulating host's antitumor  immunity under HIFU ablation, especially in synergizing with PD-L1 antibody  immunotherapy.","2023-01","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","1","11","","J Immunother Cancer","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

However, the lack of a  reliable ultrasound-based monitoring technique limits its clinical use.  Ultrasound currently provides real-time HIFU planning, but its use for monitoring  is usually limited to detecting the backscatter increase resulting from chaotic  bubble appearance. HIFU has been shown to generate stiffening in various tissues,  so elastography is an interesting lead for ablation monitoring. However, the  standard techniques usually require the generation of a controlled push which can  be problematic in deeper organs. Passive elastography offers a potential  alternative as it uses the physiological wave field to estimate the elasticity in  tissues and not an external perturbation. This technique was adapted to process  B-mode images acquired with a clinical system. It was first shown to faithfully  assess elasticity in calibrated phantoms. The technique was then implemented on  the Focal One® clinical system to evaluate its capacity to detect HIFU lesions in  vitro (CNR = 9.2 dB) showing its independence regarding the bubbles resulting  from HIFU and in vivo where the physiological wave field was successfully used to  detect and delineate lesions of different sizes in porcine liver. Finally, the  technique was performed for the very first time in four prostate cancer patients  showing strong variation in elasticity before and after HIFU treatment (average  variation of 33.0 ± 16.0 %). Passive elastography has shown evidence of its  potential to monitor HIFU treatment and thus help spread its use.","2023-12-18","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","PP","","IEEE Trans Med Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 38109239","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to large domain sizes and the generation of higher  harmonics, such simulations are computationally challenging, particularly in 3-D  problems with shock waves. Current numerical methods are based on computationally  inefficient uniform meshes that resolve the highest harmonics across the entire  spatial domain. To address this challenge, we present an adaptive numerical  algorithm for computationally efficient nonlinear acoustic holography. At each  propagation step, the algorithm monitors the harmonic content of the acoustic  signal and adjusts its discretization parameters accordingly. This enables  efficient local resolution of higher harmonics in areas of high nonlinearity  while avoiding unnecessary resolution elsewhere. Furthermore, the algorithm  actively adapts to the signal's nonlinearity level, eliminating the need for  prior reference simulations or information about the spatial distribution of the  harmonic content of the acoustic field. The proposed algorithm incorporates an  upsampling process in the frequency domain to accommodate the generation of  higher harmonics in forward propagation and a downsampling process when higher  harmonics are decimated in backward propagation. The efficiency of the algorithm  was evaluated for highly nonlinear 3-D problems, demonstrating a significant  reduction in computational cost with a nearly 50-fold speedup over a uniform mesh  implementation. Our findings enable a more rapid and efficient approach to  modeling nonlinear high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) wave propagation.","2023-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","1516-1526","","11","70","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 37703162","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effect of MRgFUS on immune cell composition was also characterized and  quantified using flow cytometry.

Ten different FT modalities have been  described in literature. However, FT is not yet recommended by the International  Guidelines, due to the lack of robust data on Oncological Outcomes. The objective  of our Narrative Review is to evaluate the oncological profile of the available  FT modalities and to offer a comprehensive overview of the definitions of Cancer  Control for FT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature search was performed on  21(st) February 2023 using PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus, following the Preferred  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA).  Articles reporting whole gland-treatments were excluded. All articles reporting  oncological outcomes were included. RESULTS: One-hundred-twenty-four studies,  reporting data on more than 8000 patients treated with FT, were included.  Overall, 40 papers were on High Intensity Focal Ultrasound (HIFU), 24 on Focal  Cryotherapy, 13 on Irreversible Electroporation (IRE), 11 on Focal brachytherapy,  10 on Focal Laser Ablation (FLA), 8 on Photo-Dynamic Therapy (PDT), 3 on  Microwave ablation, 3 on Robotic Partial Prostatectomy, 2 on bipolar Radio  Frequency Ablation (bRFA), 1 on Prostatic Artery Embolization (PAE) and 9  comparative papers. Overall, the Biochemical Recurrence (BCR) rate ranged from 0%  (Focal Brachytherapy) to 67.5% (HIFU); the Salvage treatment rate ranged from 1%  (IRE) to 54% (HIFU) considering re-treatment with FT and from 0% (Focal  Brachytherapy) to 66.7% considering standard Radical Treatments. There is no  univocal definition of Cancer Control, however the ""Phoenix criteria"" for BCR  were the most commonly used. CONCLUSIONS: FT is a promising alternative treatment  for localized prostate cancer in terms of Oncological Outcomes, however there is  a wide heterogeneity in the definition of cancer control, the reporting of  oncological outcomes and a lack of high-quality clinical trials. Solid  comparative studies with standard treatments and an unambiguous consensus on how  to describe Cancer Control in the field of Focal Therapy are needed.","2023-07-28","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","","","","","","Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

The acoustic pressure field  was calculated using the nonlinear Westervelt equation and coupled with the  Pennes bioheat transfer equation to obtain the temperature distribution. To  investigate the effect of the thickness of the fat layer on pressure and thermal  distributions, the thickness of the fat layer behind the focal point  (z = 13.5 mm) changed from 8 to 24 mm by 2 mm step. The pressure and temperature  distribution spectra were extracted. RESULTS: The simulated results were  validated using the experimental results with a 98% correlation coefficient  (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference between the pressure amplitude and  temperature distribution for the 8-14 mm thickness of the fat layer (p < 0.05).

It remains  however unclear whether FUS is being introduced in an ethically and  methodologically sound manner. The IDEAL-D framework for the introduction of  surgical innovations and the SYRCLE and ROBINS-I tools for assessing the risk of  bias in animal studies and non-randomized trials, respectively, provide a  comprehensive evaluation for this. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: A comprehensive  literature review on FUS in neuro-oncology was conducted. Subsequently, the  included studies were evaluated using the IDEAL-D framework, SYRCLE, and ROBINS-I  tools. RESULTS: In total, 19 published studies and 12 registered trials were  identified. FUS demonstrated successful BBB disruption, increased drug delivery,  and improved survival rates. However, the SYRCLE analysis revealed a high risk of  bias in animal studies, while the ROBINS-I analysis found that most human studies  had a high risk of bias due to a lack of blinding and heterogeneous samples. Of  the 15 pre-clinical stage 0 studies, only six had formal ethical approval, and  only five followed animal care policies. Both stage 1 studies and stage 1/2a  studies failed to provide information on patient data confidentiality. Overall,  no animal or human study reached the IDEAL-D stage endpoint. CONCLUSION: FUS  holds promise for enhancing drug delivery to the brain, but its development and  implementation must adhere to rigorous safety standards using the established  ethical and methodological frameworks. The complementary use of IDEAL-D, SYRCLE,  and ROBINS-I tools indicates a high risk of bias and ethical limitations in both  animal and human studies, highlighting the need for further improvements in study  design for a safe implementation of FUS in neuro-oncology.","2023-12","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","4259-4277","","12","165","","Acta Neurochir (Wien)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss in detail the  neuroethical implications of MR-guided focused ultrasound for neuropsychiatric  illness as an emerging treatment modality. METHODS: Due to the lack of published  literature on the topic, the approach involved a detailed survey and review of  technical and medical literature relevant to focused ultrasound and established  ethical issues related to alternative treatment options for patients with  treatment-resistant, severe and persistent mental illness. The manuscript is  structured according to thematic and topical findings. RESULTS: This technology  has potential benefits for patients suffering with severe mental illness,  compared with established alternatives. The balance of technical, neuroscientific  and clinical considerations should inform ethical deliberations. The nascent  literature base, nuances in legal classification and permissibility depending  upon jurisdiction, influences of past ethical issues associated with alternative  treatments, tone and framing in media articles, and complexity of clinical trials  all influence ethical assessment and evaluations of multiple stakeholders.  Recommendations for future research are provided based on these factors.

METHODS: We  searched databases including PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar for 11  essential keywords, including cryolipolysis, high-intensity focused ultrasound  (HIFU), shock wave, low-level laser therapy (LLLT), radiofrequency (RF),  capacitive resistive electrical transfer (TECAR), high-intensity focused  electromagnetic (HIFEM), electromyostimulation (EMS), carboxytherapy,  mesotherapy, and acupuncture and their abbreviations, in addition to obesity,  overweight, cellulite, subcutaneous fat, and body contouring. RESULTS: Totally  193 references were used in 11 main topics. CONCLUSION: In order to help  physicians with finding the best evidence in different methods, the data were  summarised in 11 topics. Furthermore, FDA-approved devices, side effects and  common protocols were described in each section. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE I: This  journal requires that authors 39 assign a level of evidence to each article.

This non-invasive method induces tumour cell necrosis by increasing the  local temperature and mechanical pressure. However, the clinical application of  HIFU is limited given its low penetration depth and the incidence of off-target  side effects. With their promising structural adjustability and targeting  ability, nanomedicines have been adopted to improve the ablative efficacy of HIFU  in the treatment of cancer. By selectively changing the acoustic environment  (tissue structure, density and blood supply) of tumour tissue, these  nanomedicines may allow for lower HIFU doses and treatment duration, while  additionally achieving a higher degree of efficacy. The use of nanomedicines may  also enable cancer theranostics of HIFU, allowing for precise cancer  therapeutics. The present review aimed to provide an overview of advances in  nanomedicines for HIFU cancer treatment and theranostics, stating their current  limitations and future perspectives.","2023-04","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","170","","4","25","","Exp Ther Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright: © Zheng et al.","","","","","","Place: Greece PMID: 37006877  PMCID: PMC10061041","","","","cancer treatment; high-intensity focused ultrasound; multi-model imaging; nanomaterial; theranostics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The technique is based on focused  ultrasound waves guided by MRI. By using high or low-frequency waves,  thermoablation of smaller tissue volumes centrally in the brain or a safe,  temporary opening of the blood-brain barrier can be carried out for better  penetration of chemotherapy. Numerous studies on neuro-oncological treatments are  ongoing, signaling increasing popularity for the technique in the near future.","2023-09-11","2024-03-06 16:57:30","2024-03-06T16:57:30Z","","V01230007","","37","185","","Ugeskr Laeger","","","","","","","","dan","Published under Open Access CC-BY-NC-BD 4.0. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/.","","","","","","Place: Denmark PMID: 37772498","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
