We aimed to demonstrate the implementation of an ERAS pathway in the  treatment of uterine fibroids with focused ultrasound ablation surgery (FUAS).  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective data analysis was performed on clinical  outcomes encompassing the following three phases: before ERAS (pre-ERAS), during  adjustment of ERAS (interim-ERAS), and after the introduction of an ERAS program  (post-ERAS). The purpose of describing the interim-ERAS was to provide references  for the formulation of the program during the course of FUAS by describing the  adjustment processes. Data from patients admitted to the hospital from September  2019 to December 2019 and April 2020 to November 2020 and who met the criteria  for FUAS in the treatment of their uterine fibroids were examined. Length of  stay, cost of surgery, postoperative pain score, utilization of postoperative  analgesics, and incidence of postoperative adverse events were compared across  the abovementioned three phases. RESULTS: Compared with the pre-phase, the cost  of treatment and length of stay were reduced after the implementation of ERAS.  The use of analgesics before leaving the operating room, as well as the incidence  of postoperative nausea and vomiting, were also reduced. CONCLUSION: The  implementation of an ERAS protocol might benefit patients with uterine fibroids  treated with FUAS in terms of requiring a shorter hospitalization period, lower  costs, and reduced opioid use.","2022","2024-03-06 17:06:14","2024-03-06T17:06:14Z","","414-420","","1","39","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35236194","","","","*ERAS; *Enhanced Recovery After Surgery; *FUAS; *Leiomyoma/drug therapy/surgery; *perioperative care; *uterine fibroids; Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use; Humans; Length of Stay; Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting/drug therapy; Retrospective Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At 7-9 days post-tumor inoculation, the tumor grew to 5-10 mm, and  ~50-75% tumor volume was treated by ultrasound-guided histotripsy, by delivering  1-2 cycle histotripsy pulses at 100 Hz PRF (focal peak negative pressure P-  &gt;30 MPa), using a custom 1 MHz transducer.

METHOD: This pilot prospective observational study included patients  scheduled for emergency, non-cardiac surgery. The treating team completed a  diagnosis and management plan before and after focused cardiac and lung  ultrasound, which was performed by a junior doctor. Changes to diagnosis and  management after ultrasound were recorded. Ultrasound images were assessed for  image and diagnostic interpretation by an independent expert. RESULTS: There was  a total of 57 patients at age 77 ± 8 years. Cardiopulmonary pathology was  suspected after clinical assessment in 28% vs. 72% after ultrasound (including  abnormal haemodynamic state in 61%, valvular lesions in 32%, acute pulmonary  oedema/interstitial syndrome in 9% and bilateral pleural effusions in 2%). In 67%  of patients, the perioperative management was changed. The changes were in fluid  therapy in 30%, cardiology consultation in 7%, formal in- or out-patient,  transthoracic echocardiography in 11% and 30% respectively. DISCUSSION: The  impact of pre-operative focused cardiac and lung ultrasound on diagnosis and  management of patients on the hospital ward before emergency non-cardiac surgery  by a junior doctor was comparable to previous studies of anaesthetists  experienced in focused ultrasound. However, the ability to recognise when image  quality is insufficient for diagnosis is an important consideration for novice  sonographers.

In this article we present  the localized release of doxorubicin (DOX) from phosphatidyldiglycerol (DPPG(2))  based thermosensitive liposomes using MR-HIFU mediated hyperthermia in a swine  model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: German landrace pigs of weights between 37.5 and  53.5 kg received a 30-min infusion of DOX containing thermosensitive liposomes  (50 mg DOX/m(2)). The pigs' biceps femoris was treated locally in two separate  target areas with mild hyperthermia using magnetic resonance guided high  intensity focused ultrasound, starting 10 min and 60 min after initiation of the  infusion, respectively. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of DOX were  determined and an analysis of the treatment parameters' influence was performed.  RESULTS: Compared to untreated tissue, we found a 15-fold and a 7-fold increase  in DOX concentration in the muscle volumes that had undergone hyperthermia  starting 10 min and 60 min after the beginning of the infusion, respectively. The  pharmacokinetic analysis showed a prolonged circulation time of DOX and a  correlation between the AUC of extra-liposomal DOX in the bloodstream and the  amount of DOX accumulated in the target tissue. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated  a workflow for MR-HIFU hyperthermia drug delivery that can be adapted to a  clinical setting, showing that HIFU-hyperthermia is a suitable method for local  drug release of DOX using DPPG(2) based thermosensitive liposomes in stationary  targets. Using the developed pharmacokinetic model, an optimization of the drug  quantity deposited in the target via the timing of infusion and hyperthermia  should be possible.","2022-03","2024-03-06 17:06:09","2024-03-06T17:06:09Z","","798-812","","","343","","J Control Release","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Innovations, quality & outcomes","","2542-4548","10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2021.11.007","","Since its approval in treating a number of movement disorders, magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been adopted rapidly as one of the  standard treatment modalities internationally. However, the efficiency of the  energy delivered by the ultrasonic waves is largely determined by the highly  variable bone morphology and density characteristics of the skull. One of the  widely accepted indices used to facilitate patient selection is the skull density  ratio (SDR). Earlier literature suggested that an SDR of less than 0.4 would be  unfavorable for MRgFUS treatment. Some prior studies have excluded patients with  hyperostosis. However, there is little published data regarding the impact of  other skull features such as hyperostosis on treatment success. We present the  case of a 66-year-old man with medically refractory essential tremor who had an  SDR of 0.38 and extensive hyperostosis frontalis interna and underwent attempted  MRgFUS thalamotomy treatment. However, intraoperatively the treatment was  unsuccessful in generating sufficiently elevated temperature to create a lesion  of the usual desired volume, and as expected, there was minimal clinical  improvement. For comparison, we also summarize a case series of 4 other patients  with an SDR of less than 0.4 who had successful outcomes. We believe that SDR  should not be used as the only means of selecting patients for MRgFUS. Instead,  important factors such as hyperostosis should be taken into consideration for  patient selection and pretreatment counseling.","2022-02","2024-03-06 17:06:08","2024-03-06T17:06:08Z","","10-15","","1","6","","Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

There has been a rapid increase  in TUS human studies in recent years, with more than half of studies to date  published after 2020. This rapid growth in the relevant body of literature  necessitates comprehensive reviews to update clinicians and researchers.  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to review human studies with an emphasis on  TUS devices, sonication parameters, outcome measures, results, and adverse  effects, as well as highlight future directions of investigation. METHODS: A  systematic review was conducted by searching the Web of Science and PubMed  databases on January 12, 2022. Human studies of TUS were included. RESULTS: A  total of 35 studies were identified using focused/unfocused ultrasound devices. A  total of 677 subjects belonging to diverse cohorts (i.e., healthy, chronic pain,  dementia, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, depression) were enrolled. The  stimulation effects vary in a sonication parameter-dependant fashion. Clinical,  neurophysiological, radiological and histological outcome measures were assessed.  No severe adverse effects were reported in any of the studies surveyed. Mild  symptoms were observed in 3.4% (14/425) of the subjects, including headache, mood  deterioration, scalp heating, cognitive problems, neck pain, muscle twitches,  anxiety, sleepiness and pruritis. CONCLUSIONS: Although increasingly being used,  TUS is still in its early phases. TUS can change short-term brain excitability  and connectivity, induce long-term plasticity, and modulate behavior. New  techniques should be used to further elucidate its underlying mechanisms and  identify its application in novel populations.","2022-05-06","2024-03-06 17:06:07","2024-03-06T17:06:07Z","","737-746","","3","15","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

This study investigates the feasibility of  using histotripsy, a non-invasive, non-thermal focused ultrasound ablation  method, to ablate uterine fibroids. Human fibroid samples (n = 16) were harvested  after hysterectomy or myomectomy procedures at Carilion Memorial Hospital.  Histotripsy was applied to ex vivo fibroids in two sets of experiments using a  700-kHz clinical transducer to apply multicycle histotripsy pulses and a  prototype 500-kHz transducer to apply single-cycle histotripsy pulses. Ultrasound  imaging was used for real-time treatment monitoring, and post-treatment ablation  was quantified histologically using hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome  stains. Results revealed that multicycle histotripsy generated diffuse cavitation  in targeted fibroids, with minimal cellular ablative changes after treatment with  2000 pulses/point. Single-cycle pulsing generated well-confined bubble clouds  with evidence of early coagulative necrosis on histological assessment in samples  treated with 2000 pulses/point, near-complete ablation in samples treated with  4000 pulses/point and complete tissue destruction in samples treated with 10,000  pulses/point. This study illustrates that histotripsy is capable of fibroid  ablation under certain pulsing parameters and warrants further investigation as  an improved non-invasive ablation method for the treatment of leiomyomas.","2022-05-28","2024-03-06 17:06:03","2024-03-06T17:06:03Z","","S0301-5629(22)00362-3","","","","","Ultrasound Med Biol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Next, histotripsy was applied to CCs (n = 6) with the  treatment contained to the tumor. Post-treatment, the ablation was visualized  using ultrasound, and subjects were monitored over time. Histotripsy achieved an  average of 73% reduction of tumor diameter 26 d after treatment, with no  significant adverse events. Notably, three of six treated tumors were  undetectable after 2.5 wk.

These effects can be achieved noninvasively, making  sensitive and specific bubble imaging essential for histotripsy guidance.  Plane-wave ultrasound imaging can track bubble clouds with an excellent temporal  resolution, but there is a significant reduction in echoes when deep-seated  organs are targeted. Chirp-coded excitation uses wideband, long-duration imaging  pulses to increase signals at depth and promote nonlinear bubble oscillations. In  this study, we evaluated histotripsy bubble contrast with chirp-coded excitation  in scattering gel phantoms and a subcutaneous mouse tumor model. A range of  imaging pulse durations were tested, and compared to a standard plane-wave pulse  sequence. Received chirped signals were processed with matched filters to  highlight components associated with either fundamental or subharmonic  (bubble-specific) frequency bands. The contrast-to-tissue ratio (CTR) was  improved in scattering media for subharmonic contrast relative to fundamental  contrast (both chirped and standard imaging pulses) with the longest-duration  chirped-pulse tested (7.4 [Formula: see text] pulse duration). The CTR was  improved for subharmonic contrast relative to fundamental contrast (both chirped  and standard imaging pulses) by 4.25 dB ± 1.36 dB in phantoms and 3.84 dB ± 6.42  dB in vivo. No systematic changes were observed in the bubble cloud size or  dissolution rate between sequences, indicating image resolution was maintained  with the long-duration imaging pulses.

Biological similarities between canine and human OS make the dog an informative comparative oncology research model to advance treatment options for primary OS. Evaluating histotripsy for ablating spontaneous canine primary OS will build a foundation upon which histotripsy can be translated clinically into a standard of care therapy for canine and human OS. METHODS: Five dogs with suspected spontaneous OS were treated with a 500 kHz histotripsy system guided by real-time ultrasound image guidance. Spherical ablation volumes within each tumor (1.25-3 cm in diameter) were treated with single cycle histotripsy pulses applied at a pulse repetition frequency of 500 Hz and a dose of 500 pulses/point. RESULTS: Tumor ablation was successfully identified grossly and histologically within the targeted treatment regions of all subjects. Histotripsy treatments were well-tolerated amongst all patients with no significant clinical adverse effects.

Over the last decade, several tumor ablation strategies have emerged as stand-alone or combination therapies. Histotripsy is the first completely noninvasive, nonthermal, and nonionizing tumor ablation method. Histotripsy can produce consistent and rapid ablations, even near critical structures. Additional benefits include real-time image guidance, high precision, and the ability to treat tumors of any predetermined size and shape. Unfortunately, the lack of clinically and physiologically relevant preclinical cancer models is often a significant limitation with all focal tumor ablation strategies. The majority of studies testing histotripsy for cancer treatment have focused on small animal models, which have been critical in moving this field forward and will continue to be essential for providing mechanistic insight. While these small animal models have notable translational value, there are significant limitations in terms of scale and anatomical relevance. To address these limitations, a diverse range of large animal models and spontaneous tumor studies in veterinary patients have emerged to complement existing rodent models. These models and veterinary patients are excellent at providing realistic avenues for developing and testing histotripsy devices and techniques designed for future use in human patients. Here, we provide a review of animal models used in preclinical histotripsy studies and compare histotripsy ablation in these models using a series of original case reports across a broad spectrum of preclinical animal models and spontaneous tumors in veterinary patients.","2022-01","2024-03-06 17:05:55","2024-03-06T17:05:55Z","","5-26","","1","69","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","Histotripsy Ablation in Preclinical Animal Models of Cancer and Spontaneous Tumors in Veterinary Patients","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34478363","","","","*Ablation Techniques; *High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; *Neoplasms/therapy; Animals; Humans; Models, Animal; Review","Ablation Techniques; High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; Neoplasms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects  were computed after propensity score matching and expressed as average treatment  effect (ATE). Compared to LRP, HIFU-FT was associated with increased risk of  treatment failure (ATE 0.103-0.164, depending on definition, p < 0.01) and lower  risk of urinary incontinence (ATE -0.808 at 12 months, p < 0.01). Risk of  erectile dysfunction was higher in the LRP group (ATE 5.092, p < 0.01). Our  results demonstrate that HIFU-FT may be a reasonable treatment option in selected  PCa patients, willing to preserve their EF and urinary continence yet accepting a  higher risk of treatment failure.","2022-02-09","2024-03-06 17:05:50","2024-03-06T17:05:50Z","","","","2","12","","J Pers Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 35207739  PMCID: PMC8877347","","","","erectile dysfunction; focal therapy; high-intensity focused-ultrasound; prostate cancer; urinary incontinence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND  METHODS: We searched the following databases from their beginning to 5 November  2021: PubMed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library. RESULTS: Overall, 21 studies  were included in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that HIFU had a higher  re-intervention rate than UAE (relative risk [RR] = 4.06, 95% confidence interval  [CI]: 2.47-6.69) and offered no significant advantages in reducing the symptom  severity score (SSS) (mean difference [MD] = 17.01, 95% CI: 10.25-23.77) and  improving the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) score (MD= -18.32, 95% CI:  -24.87 to -11.78) in the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids. However,  compared with UAE, HIFU may be associated with a higher pregnancy rate (RR =  17.44, 95% CI: 2.40-126.50) and may have a significant advantage in shortening  pregnancy interval and preserving ovarian function. Moreover, upon comparing HIFU  with traditional surgical treatments, the HIFU group showed significantly  improved HRQoL score (MD = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.15-3.35), but the re-intervention rate  (RR = 1.65, 95% CI: 0.59-4.57), pregnancy rate (RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.90-1.13),  SSS and ovarian function did not significantly differ between the two groups.  CONCLUSIONS: Although HIFU has relatively high re-intervention rate, it may offer  a higher pregnancy rate and shorter pregnancy interval with little influence on  ovarian function, thus making it an attractive option for treating symptomatic  fibroids in young women who wish to plan a pregnancy in the future.","2022","2024-03-06 17:05:47","2024-03-06T17:05:47Z","","230-238","","1","39","","Int J Hyperthermia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35094613","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; *High-intensity focused ultrasound treatment; *Leiomyoma/surgery/therapy; *Uterine Neoplasms/surgery/therapy; *meta-analysis; *symptomatic uterine fibroids; *traditional surgeries; *uterine artery embolization; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Satisfactory outcomes are not achieved with  current therapies; thus, novel treatments are urgently needed. High-intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a novel therapy for ablating tissue from the outside  of the body by focusing ultrasonic waves from multiple sources on the tumor. In  this therapy, only the focal area is heated to 80-100 ºC, which causes  coagulative necrosis of the tissue, with hardly any impact on the tissue outside  the focal area. Although HIFU is a minimally invasive treatment and is expected  to be useful, it is not yet generally known. Here, we discuss the usefulness of  HIFU treatment for un-resectable advanced PC using the results of previous  research, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews on its efficacy and safety. HIFU  therapy for un-resectable PC is useful for its anti-tumor effect and pain relief,  and is expected to prolong survival time and improve quality of life. Although  HIFU for PC has several limitations and further study is needed, this technique  can be safely performed on un-resectable advanced PC. In future, HIFU could be  utilized as a minimally invasive treatment strategy for PC patients with a poor  prognosis.","2022-05-12","2024-03-06 17:05:43","2024-03-06T17:05:43Z","","","","","","","J Med Ultrason (2001)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Histological changes in post-treatment needle biopsies are reviewed to better  understand HIFU failures. Between 2016 and 2021, 50 patients with localized  prostate cancer were enrolled and treated in this study. Of these, 10 patients  underwent salvage therapy after radiation failure and 7 did not have  post-treatment needle biopsies available for review and were excluded. Inclusion  criteria included pathologically confirmed prostate cancer and clinical stage  T1/T2 disease. We describe the histological changes in post-treatment needle  biopsies as part of routine follow-up. Biopsies were examined for presence,  distribution and extent of residual adenocarcinoma, Gleason score, and ablative  tissue changes. A total of 33 patients underwent HIFU hemi-ablation treatment of  localized prostate cancer as primary treatment with post-treatment biopsies  available for review. The average mean age of the patients was 64 years (range,  52-81 years). The average PSA (prostate-specific antigen) level of the patients  was 6.3 ng/mL (range, 2.4-14.7 ng/mL). The Gleason scores assigned in  pretreatment prostate needle biopsies are as follows: 3 + 3 (1 case, 3%), 3 + 4  (21 cases, 64%), 4 + 3 (9 cases, 27%), and 4 + 4 (2 cases, 6%). In post-treatment  needle biopsies, 33 cases (100%) showed variable degrees of fibrosis ranging from  mild to moderate. Twenty-four of 33 cases (73%) showed necrosis usually  associated with acute and/or chronic inflammation. Histological examination of  benign glands revealed glandular heterogeneity including atrophy and basal cell  hyperplasia. Eight cases (24%) had residual prostatic adenocarcinoma after  treatment, of which 4 cases were assigned Gleason score: ≥3 + 4. In cases with  residual adenocarcinoma, 8 cases (100%) showed nuclear enlargement, 5 cases  (63%), cytoplasmic vacuolization, and 1 case (13%) showed nuclear pyknosis;  otherwise, no discernible effects of treatment were seen. Morphological  alterations included a spectrum of changes ranging from extensive coagulative  stromal necrosis secondary to thermal injury to atrophic changes in benign  prostatic tissue after HIFU treatment. Our findings also support the hypothesis  that HIFU failure results from inadequate targeting rather than failure within a  treated zone.","2022-01","2024-03-06 17:05:42","2024-03-06T17:05:42Z","","79-84","","","119","","Hum Pathol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Alterations in tubulin and associated proteins have  been implicated in resistance to PTX. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)  induces deep tumor penetration of anti-tumor agents in solid tumors. METHODS: We  investigated the influence of HIFU on the anti-tumor activities of PTX in breast  cancer. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed in this research:  mice were treated with 2 mg/Kg PTX through tail vein injection, while breast  cancer cells were treated with 400 nM PTX. Cell viability was analyzed through  Cell Counting Kit-8. Cell apoptosis was evaluated through Annexin-V/PI Apoptosis  Analysis Kit. The activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and  the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) were evaluated by relative commercial  kits. RESULTS: HIFU enhanced PTX-inhibited breast cancer cell viability and  PTX-induced cell apoptosis. Simultaneous treatment of HIFU and PTX decreased the  activities of CAT and SOD and increased the concentration of MDA. In mice bearing  MDA-MB-231 tumors, the treatment of HIFU and PTX significantly decreased tumor  size, increased body weight and elevated animal survival. HIFU enhanced the  distribution of PTX in tumor tissues. CONCLUSION: The performance of HIFU  promoted the distribution of PTX and enhanced its anti-tumor activities in breast  cancer.","2022","2024-03-06 17:05:36","2024-03-06T17:05:36Z","","1303-1312","","","14","","Cancer Manag Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Chen et al.","","","","","","PMID: 35386184  PMCID: PMC8978695","","","","BreastCancer; breast cancer; cancer therapy; high-intensity focused ultrasound; paclitaxel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From September 2017 to May 2020, 42  consecutive patients with pathologically proven desmoid tumors treated with HIFUA  for the first time were enrolled. These were divided into two groups:  post-operative recurrent group (30 cases) and non-surgery group (12 cases). The  basic characteristics, treatment parameters, ablation efficacy, tolerance and  adverse events were recorded and compared between groups. The minimum distance  between the tumor and skin surface in the post-operative recurrent group was  significantly smaller than that in the non-surgery group (6.9 mm vs. 10.8 mm,  p = 0.011), but there was no significant difference in the other basic  characteristics (p > 0.05).

HIFUA was successfully performed, and a large volume  of coagulation necrosis was obtained from all patients without serious or  life-threatening adverse events. Furthermore, there was no significant difference  in the incidence of moderate adverse events and average length of stay between  groups (p > 0.05). The average power and intensity of HIFUA treatment were  adversely affected by surgical scar and tumor infiltration along the surgical  path.

METHODS: We searched studies comparing HIFU with surgery for  fibroids in different databases from January 2000 to July 2020. The mean difference  (MD) or relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for different outcome  parameters was synthesized. RESULTS: We included 10 studies involving 4450 women.  Compared with the surgery group, the decrease in uterine fibroid severity score at  6- and 12-month follow-up was higher in the HIFU group (MD - 4.16, 95% CI - 7.39 to  - 0.94, and MD - 2.44, 95% CI - 3.67 to - 1.20, p < 0.05). The increase in  quality-of-life (QoL) score at 6- and 12-month follow-up was higher in the HIFU  group (MD 2.13, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.14, and MD 2.34, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.85, p < 0.05).  The duration of hospital stay and the time to return to work was shorter in the HIFU  group (MD - 3.41 days, 95% CI - 5.11 to - 1.70, and MD - 11.61 days, 95% CI - 19.73  to - 3.50, p < 0.05). The incidence of significant complications was lower in the  HIFU group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.81, p < 0.05). The differences in the outcomes  of adverse events, symptom recurrence, re-intervention, and pregnancy were not  statistically significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HIFU is superior to surgery in  terms of symptomatic relief, improvement in QoL, recovery, and significant  complications. However, HIFU showed comparable effects to surgery regarding the  incidence of adverse events, symptom recurrence, re-intervention, and pregnancy. KEY  POINTS: • HIFU ablation is superior to surgery in terms of symptomatic relief,  improvement in QoL, recovery, and significant complications. • HIFU has comparable  effects to surgery in terms of symptom recurrence rate, re-intervention rate, and  pregnancy rate, indicating that HIFU is a promising non-invasive therapy that seems  not to raise the risk of recurrence and re-intervention or deteriorate fertility  compared to surgical approaches in women with fibroids. • There is still a lack of  good-quality comparative data and further randomized studies are necessary to  provide sufficient and reliable data, especially on re-intervention rate and  pregnancy outcome.","2022-02","2024-03-06 17:05:31","2024-03-06T17:05:31Z","","1195-1204","","2","32","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

Among the various  modulation mechanisms, ultrasound enables noninvasive label-free deep access to  mammalian brain tissue. To date, most if not all ultrasonic neural modulation  implementations are based on ∼1 MHz carrier frequency. The long acoustic  wavelength results in a spatially coarse modulation zone, often spanning over  multiple function regions. The modulation of one function region is inevitably  linked with the modulation of its neighboring regions. Moreover, the lack of  in vivo cellular resolution cell-type-specific recording capabilities in most  studies prevents the revealing of the genuine cellular response to ultrasound. To  significantly increase the spatial resolution, we explored the application of  high-frequency ultrasound. To investigate the neuronal response at cellular  resolutions, we developed a dual-modality system combining in vivo two-photon  calcium imaging and focused ultrasound modulation. The studies show that the  ∼30 MHz ultrasound can suppress the neuronal activity in awake mice at 100-μm  scale spatial resolutions, paving the way for high-resolution ultrasonic neural  modulation. The dual-modality in vivo system validated through this study will  serve as a general platform for studying the dynamics of various cell types in  response to ultrasound.","2022-02","2024-03-06 17:05:29","2024-03-06T17:05:29Z","","190-196","","1","15","","Brain Stimul","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: Seventy-two patients with 75 nodules were  treated with HIFU at 2 centers from 2014-2019. Median nodule volume was 4.4 ml  (range 0.33-53). The therapeutic ultrasound probe (EchoPulse THC900888-H)  generated 80-90 °C in the target tissue with 87.6-320.3 J per sonication. Nodal  volume was measured at baseline and over 12 months after therapy in a  retrospective bicentric-study with long-term follow-up. Hormonal-thyroid function  (TSH, T3, T4) was measured before and after ablation. Complications were  assessed. RESULTS: Significant volume reduction (p < 0.05 Wilcoxon-signed-rank  test) of thyroid nodules was 38.98% at 3 months, 37.32% at 6 months, 61.54% at 9  months and 60.66% at 12 months. Volume reduction of nodules <3 ml did not differ  significantly from nodules >3 ml (p > 0.05 Mann-Whitney test). At 3 months solid  nodules had a significant volume reduction of 52.08%, complex nodules of 32.57%,  nodules treated under regional anesthesia of 33.07% and under general anesthesia  of 49.47%. Hormonal-thyroid function was not influenced significantly by HIFU  therapy (p > 0.05 Wilcoxon-signed-rank test). Complication rate was 3.8%. No  long-term complications occurred. CONCLUSION: Significant volume reduction of  thyroid nodules up to 12 months after HIFU was shown. All complications were  reversible. Therapy was more efficient in solid than complex nodules and in  nodules treated under general anesthesia than with regional anesthesia.  Hormonal-thyroid-function was not affected.

METHODS: Dogs diagnosed with subcutaneous solid tumors were recruited, staged and pretreatment biopsies were obtained. A single HIFU treatment was delivered to result in partial tumor ablation using a commercially available HIFU unit. Tumors were resected 3-6 days post HIFU and samples obtained for histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Total RNA was isolated from paired pre and post treated FFPE tumor samples, and quantitative gene expression analysis was performed using the nCounter Canine IO Panel. RESULTS: A total of 20 dogs diagnosed with solid tumors were recruited and treated in the study. Tumors treated included Soft Tissue Sarcoma (n = 15), Mast Cell Tumor (n = 3), Osteosarcoma (n = 1), and Thyroid Carcinoma (n = 1). HIFU was well tolerated with only 1 dog experiencing a clinically significant adverse event. Pathology confirmed the presence of complete tissue ablation at the HIFU targeted site and immunohistochemistry indicated immune cell infiltration at the treated/untreated tumor border. Quantitative gene expression analysis indicated that 28 genes associated with T-cell activation were differentially expressed post-HIFU. CONCLUSIONS: HIFU appears to be safe and feasible for the treatment of subcutaneous canine solid tumors, resulting in ablation of the targeted tissue.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 91 patients with CSP treated  by HIFU and USg-D&C in People's Hospital of Deyang City between January 2017 and  December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Based on the HIFU  sonication strategy, patients were divided to two groups: 44 patients were  exposed to 'C-shape' sonication layer by layer around the implantation location  of the pregnancy sac (control group), while the other 47 patients were exposed to  'I-shape' sonication layer by layer only on the deep part which close to the  bladder of the implantation location of the pregnancy sac (experimental group).  The differences in clinical efficacy between the two groups were analyzed.  Baseline characteristics, technical parameters of HIFU treatment and USg-D&C data  were recorded. Adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS: No statistically  significant difference was observed between the two groups in baseline  characteristics including age, body mass index (BMI), menopause time, largest  diameter of gestational sac, pretreatment serum β-hCG, thickness of gestational  sac, embedding myometrium, previous cesarean sections and interval from last  cesarean section (CS). The average treatment intensity in the experimental group  was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < .05). The median  sonication time, total energy used for HIFU ablation, and energy efficiency  factor (EEF) in the experimental group were significantly lower than the control  group (p < .05). No statistically significant difference was observed between the  two groups in treatment power and treatment time (p > .05).

METHODS: We retrospectively  investigated 206 patients who underwent WGA or PGA for localized PCa. Follow-up  prostatic biopsy was performed 1 year postoperatively. We performed intergroup  comparison of the postoperative functional and oncological outcomes and  complication rates. RESULTS: In this study, 152 and 54 patients underwent PGA and  WGA, respectively. The total operation time was significantly longer in the WGA  than in the PGA group (107.5 minutes vs. 95.0 minutes, P = .004). Of the 86  patients who underwent postoperative prostate biopsy, no residual cancer was  detected in 70.4% of the WGA and 72.9% of the PGA group. Incontinence-free  survival was significantly shorter in the PGA than in the WGA group (P= .047);  however, no significant intergroup difference was observed in erectile  dysfunction-free survival (P= .317).

However, US  monitoring is often hindered by strong HIFU interference, which overwhelms the  echoes received by the imaging array. In this study, a method of Golay-encoded US  monitoring is proposed to visualize the imaged object for simultaneous HIFU  treatment. It effectively removes HIFU interference patterns in real-time B-mode  imaging and improves the metrics of image quality, such as peak signal-to-noise  ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), and contrast ratio (CR). Compared to  the pulse-inversion sequence, the N -bit Golay sequence can boost the echo  magnitude of US monitoring by another N times and, thus, exhibits higher  robustness. Simulations show that a sinusoidal HIFU waveform can be fully  eliminated using Golay decoding when the bit duration of the N -bit Golay  sequence ( N is the power of 4) coincides with either odd (Case I) or even (Case  II) integer multiples of the HIFU quarter period. Experimental results also show  that the Golay decoding with Case II can increase the PSNR of US monitoring  images by more than 30 dB for both pulse- and continuous-wave HIFU transmissions.  The SSIM index also effectively improves to about unity, indicating that the  B-mode image with HIFU transmission is visually indistinguishable from that  acquired without HIFU transmission. Though Case I is inferior to Case II in the  elimination of even-order HIFU harmonic, they together enable a more flexible  selection of imaging frequencies to meet the required image resolution and  penetration for Golay-encoded US monitoring.","2022-04","2024-03-06 17:05:14","2024-03-06T17:05:14Z","","1370-1381","","4","69","","IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35192463","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; Phantoms, Imaging; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Ultrasonography/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The artifact becomes more pronounced with  intensity and power. To overcome this limitation, we propose FUS-net, a method  that incorporates a CNN-based U-net autoencoder trained end-to-end on 'clean' and  'corrupted' RF data in Tensorflow 2.3 for FUS artifact removal. The network  learns the representation of RF data and FUS artifacts in latent space so that  the output of corrupted RF input is clean RF data. We find that FUS-net perform  15% better than stacked autoencoders (SAE) on evaluated test datasets. B-mode  images beamformed from FUS-net RF shows superior speckle quality and better  contrast-to-noise (CNR) than both notch-filtered and adaptive least means squares  filtered RF data. Furthermore, FUS-net filtered images had lower errors and  higher similarity to clean images collected from unseen scans at all pressure  levels. Lastly, FUS-net RF can be used with existing cross-correlation  speckle-tracking algorithms to generate displacement maps. FUS-net currently  outperforms conventional filtering and SAEs for removing high pressure FUS  interference from RF data, and hence may be applicable to all FUS-based imaging  and therapeutic methods.","2022-04","2024-03-06 17:05:13","2024-03-06T17:05:13Z","","915-924","","4","41","","IEEE Trans Med Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 34784273  PMCID: PMC8976793","","","","*Algorithms; *Artifacts; Ultrasonography/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a first pilot study on clinical effects of  navigated and focused ultrasound neuromodulation, a dichotomy of functional  effects was found: patients with Alzheimer's disease improved cognition and  language but deteriorated with visuo-constructive functions. METHODS: We analyzed  changes in functional connectivity measured with functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) using graph analysis of a visuo-constructive network in 18  patients with Alzheimer's disease. We calculated the network's global efficiency  and tested for correlation with visuo-constructive test scores to explain this  dichotomy. RESULTS: Important visuo-constructive network nodes were not  stimulated in the pilot setting and correspondingly global efficiency of a  visuo-constructive network was decreased after TPS therapy, compatible with a  natural progress of the disease. A correlation between visuo-constructive scores  and changes in global efficiency was found. CONCLUSION: Results argue for a high  functional specificity of ultrasound-based neuromodulation with TPS.","2022-05-28","2024-03-06 17:05:10","2024-03-06T17:05:10Z","","","","","","","Neurol Ther","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Microbubble-assisted focused ultrasound (FUS) BBB opening is an  emerging technology that can transiently enhance BBB permeability. In this study,  FUS/microbubble-assisted BBB opening was investigated for the intravenous  delivery of mRNA-LNP to the brain. The intensity of FUS irradiation was optimized  to 1.5 kW/cm(2), at which BBB opening occurred efficiently without hemorrhage or  edema. Exogenous protein (luciferase) expression by mRNA-LNP, specifically at the  FUS-irradiated side of the brain, occurred only when FUS and microbubbles were  applied. This exogenous protein expression was faster but shorter than that of  plasmid DNA delivery. Furthermore, foreign protein expression was observed in the  microglia, along with CD31-positive endothelial cells, whereas no expression was  observed in astrocytes or neurons.

To circumvent  the BBB, we introduced the focused ultrasound-mediated intranasal brain drug  delivery (FUSIN) technique. FUSIN utilizes the nasal route for direct  nose-to-brain drug administration, bypassing the BBB and minimizing systemic  exposure. It also uses the transcranial application of ultrasound energy focused  at a targeted brain region to induce microbubble cavitation, which enhances the  transport of intranasally administered agents at the FUS-targeted brain location.  FUSIN is unique in that it can achieve noninvasive and localized brain drug  delivery with minimized systemic toxicity. The goal of this chapter is to provide  a detailed protocol for FUSIN delivery to the mouse brain.","2022","2024-03-06 17:05:05","2024-03-06T17:05:05Z","","501-513","","","2394","","Methods Mol Biol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Recent preclinical evidence demonstrates that  following application of focused ultrasound with microbubbles (FUS+MB), the BBB  becomes reversibly accessible to compounds that normally are brain-impermeable,  suggesting FUS+MB as a promising new platform for delivery of therapeutic agents  into the central nervous system. As a step towards translation, small cohort  clinical studies were performed demonstrating safe BBB opening in Alzheimer's  disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients  following FUS+MB, however improved drug delivery has not yet been achieved in  human. Simultaneously, rapid progress in the human induced pluripotent stem cell  (hiPSC) modeling technology allowed for development of novel Alzheimer's disease  patient-derived BBB in vitro model that reacts to FUS+MB with BBB opening and can  be used to answer fundamental questions of human BBB responses to FUS+MB in  health and disease. This review summarizes key features of the BBB that  contribute to limited drug delivery, recapitulates recent advances in the FUS+MB  mediated human BBB opening in vivo and in vitro in the context of  neurodegenerative disorders, and highlights potential strategies for fast-track  translation of the FUS+MB to improve bioavailability of drugs to the human brain.  With safe and effective application, this innovative FUS+MB technology may open  new avenues for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases leading  to improved clinical outcomes for patients.","2022-03","2024-03-06 17:05:04","2024-03-06T17:05:04Z","","427-439","","3","39","","Pharm Res","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Gradual accumulation of αSNCA aggregates in substantia  nigra (SN) diminishes the normal functioning of soluble αSNCA, leading to a loss  of dopamine (DA) neurons. In this study, we developed focused ultrasound-targeted  microbubble destruction (UTMD)-mediated PD model that could generate the disease  phenotype via αSNCA CNS gene delivery. The formation of neuronal aggregates was  analyzed with immunostaining. To evaluate the DA cell loss, we used tyrosine  hydroxylase immunostaining and HPLC analysis on DA and its two metabolites,  3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA). This loss of  DA was associated with a dose-dependent impairment in motor function, as assessed  by the rotarod motor assessment. We demonstrate that UTMD-induced SNCA expression  initiates αSNCA aggregation and results in a 50% loss of DA in SN. UTMD-related  dose-dependent neuronal loss was identified, and it correlates with the degree of  impairment of motor function. In comparison to chemical neurotoxin  1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated and conventional  intracerebral (IC)-injected animal models of PD, the UTMD-mediated αSNCA-based  mouse model offers the advantage of mimicking the rapid development of the PD  phenotype. The PD models that we created using UTMD also prove valuable in  assessing specific aspects of PD pathogenesis and can serve as a useful PD model  for the development of new therapeutic strategies.","2022-02-18","2024-03-06 17:04:59","2024-03-06T17:04:59Z","","","","2","14","","Pharmaceutics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 35214176  PMCID: PMC8876143","","","","Parkinson’s disease; blood–brain barrier opening; gene delivery; ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction; α-synuclein","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: We report our long-term experience of  treating tremor with unilateral FUS unilateral VIM-thalamotomy in tremor dominant  Parkinson's disease (TDPD) patients. METHODS: We report outcome of FUS  thalamotomy in TDPD patients with 1-5 years of follow-up. OUTCOMES: tremor  reduction assessed with Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) and Unified  Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS part III) overall and in the treated  hemibody and safety. RESULTS: Twenty-six TDPD patients completed 1-5 years of  follow-up (median follow-up 36 months, range 12-60 months). Median age was 60  years (range 46-79), with median disease duration of 6 years (range 2-16).  Immediately, treatment resulted in 100%improvement in tremor in the treated arm  in 23 patients and 90%improvement in 3 patients. In 15 patients with leg tremor,  2 patients with chin tremor and 1 patient with head tremor, tremor was  significantly improved.

The purpose of this  study is to determine the effectiveness of focused ultrasound stimulation for the  treatment of dry eye disease caused by meibomian gland dysfunction. An in vivo  study of nine Dutch Belted rabbits was conducted with focused ultrasound  stimulation of the meibomian glands. A customized line-focused ultrasonic  transducer was designed for treatment. Fluorescein imaging, Schirmer's test, and  Lipiview II ocular interferometer were used to quantify outcomes from three  aspects: safety, tear production, and lipid layer thickness. Both tear secretion  and lipid layer thickness improved following ultrasound treatment. Five to 10 min  after the ultrasound treatment, the mean values of lipid layer thickness  increased from 55.33 ± 11.15 nm to 95.67 ± 22.77 nm (p < 0.05), while the mean  values measured with the Schirmer's test increased from 2.0 ± 2.3 to 7.2 ± 4.3  (p < 0.05). Positive effects lasted more than three weeks. Adverse events such as  redness, swelling, and mild burn, occurred in two rabbits in preliminary  experiments when the eyelids sustained a temperature higher than 42°C. No serious  adverse events were found. The results suggest that ultrasound stimulation of  meibomian glands can improve both tear production and lipid secretion.

However, there  is no consensus on which sonication parameters are optimal. Furthermore, the  mechanism of action behind ultrasound neurostimulation remains poorly understood.  An invertebrate model greatly reduces biological complexity, permitting a  systematic evaluation of sonication parameters suitable for ultrasound  neurostimulation. NEW METHOD: Here, we describe the use of focused ultrasound  stimulation with an ex-vivo abdominal ganglion preparation of the California sea  hare, Aplysia californica, a long-standing model system in neurobiology. We  developed a system for stimulating an isolated ganglion preparation while  obtaining extracellular recordings from nerves. The focused ultrasound  stimulation uses one of two single-element transducers, enabling stimulation at  four distinct carrier frequencies (0.515 MHz, 1.l MHz, 1.61 MHz, 3.41 MHz).  RESULTS: Using continuous wave ultrasound, we stimulated the ganglion at all four  frequencies, and we present quantitative evaluation of elicited activation at  four different sonication durations and three peak pressure levels, eliciting up  to a 57-fold increase in spiking frequency. COMPARISON WITH ELECTRICAL  STIMULATION: We demonstrated that ultrasound-induced activation is repeatable,  and the response consistency is comparable to electrical stimulation.  CONCLUSIONS: Due to the relative ease of long-term recordings for many hours,  this ex-vivo ganglion preparation is suitable for investigating sonication  parameters and the effects of focused ultrasound stimulation on neurons.","2022-04-15","2024-03-06 17:04:53","2024-03-06T17:04:53Z","","109536","","","372","","J Neurosci Methods","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

It is currently being  investigated as a potential novel treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). This  scoping review was carried out to map available evidence pertaining to the  provision of FUS as a PD neuromodulatory tool. In accordance with the Preferred  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping  Reviews, a search was applied to Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on 13 January 2022, with no limits  applied.

All 11 studies were preclinical (6 in vivo, 2 in  vitro, 2 mix of in vivo and in vitro and 1 in silico). The preclinical evidence  indicates that FUS is safe and has beneficial neuromodulatory effects on motor  behaviour in PD. FUS appears to have a therapeutic role in influencing the  disease processes of PD, and therefore holds great promise as an attractive and  powerful neuromodulatory tool for PD.

Focused  ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles could increase the efficacy of drug  delivery to specific brain regions and is becoming a promising technology for the  treatment of central nervous system diseases. In this study, we explored the  therapeutic potential of FUS-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening of the  left striatum to deliver gastrodin (GAS) in a subacute PD mouse model induced by  1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The concentration of GAS in  the left hemisphere was detected by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography  electrospray Q-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC/ESI Q-Orbitrap) and the  distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons was detected by  immunohistochemical staining. The expression of TH, Dopamine transporter (DAT),  cleaved-caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor  (BDNF), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), and synaptophysin (SYN) protein  were detected by western blotting. Analysis showed that the concentration of GAS  in the left hemisphere of PD mice increased by approximately 1.8-fold after the  BBB was opened. FUS-mediated GAS delivery provided optimal neuroprotective  effects and was superior to the GAS or FUS control group. In addition, FUS  enhanced GAS delivery significantly increased the expression of Bcl-2, BDNF,  PSD-95, and SYN protein in the left striatum (P < 0.05) and reduced the levels of  cleaved-caspase-3 remarkably (P = 0.001). In conclusion, the enhanced delivery by  FUS effectively strengthened the protective effect of GAS on dopaminergic neurons  which may be related to the reinforcement of the anti-apoptotic activity and the  expression of synaptic-related proteins in the striatum. Data suggests that  FUS-enhanced GAS delivery may represent a new strategy for PD treatment.","2022","2024-03-06 17:04:51","2024-03-06T17:04:51Z","","884788","","","16","","Front Cell Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 Wang, Luo, Li, Liao, Liao, Chen, Chen and Ao.","","","","","","PMID: 35656407  PMCID: PMC9152004","","","","Parkinson’s disease; blood–brain barrier; drug delivery; focused ultrasound; gastrodin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ability of focused ultrasound to target  tissues deep in the body without exposing children to the morbidities associated  with conventional surgery, interventional procedures, or radiation offers  significant advantages. In 2021, there are 10 clinical pediatric focused  ultrasound studies evaluating various musculoskeletal, oncologic, neurologic, and  vascular diseases of which 8 are actively recruiting and 2 are completed.  Pediatric musculoskeletal applications of FUS include treatment of osteoid  osteoma and bone metastases using thermal ablation and high-intensity FUS.  Pediatric oncologic applications of FUS include treatment of soft tissue tumors  including desmoid tumors, malignant sarcomas, and neuroblastoma with  high-intensity FUS ablation alone, or in combination with targeted chemotherapy  delivery. Pediatric neurologic applications include treatment of benign tumors  such as hypothalamic hamartomas with thermal ablation and malignant diffuse  intrinsic pontine glioma with low-intensity FUS for blood brain barrier opening  and targeted drug delivery. Additionally, low-intensity FUS can be used to treat  seizures. Pediatric vascular applications of FUS include treatment of  arteriovenous malformations and twin-twin transfusion syndrome using ablation and  vascular occlusion.

It has been investigated for decades and presented promising  results long before novel pharmacological agents were introduced to treat  movement disorders, psychiatric disorders, pain, and epilepsy. Ablative  procedures were replaced by effective drugs during the 1950s and by Deep Brain  Stimulation (DBS) in the 1990s as a reversible neuromodulation technique. In the  last decade, however, the popularity of brain lesioning has increased again with  the introduction of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS).  OBJECTIVE: In this review, we will cover the current and emerging role of MRgFUS  in functional neurosurgery. METHODS: Literature review from PubMed and  compilation. RESULTS: Investigated since 1930, MRgFUS is a technology enabling  targeted energy delivery at the convergence of mechanical sound waves. Based on  technological advancements in phased array ultrasound transducers, algorithms  accounting for skull penetration by sound waves, and MR imaging for targeting and  thermometry, MRgFUS is capable of brain lesioning with sub-millimeter precision  and can be used in a variety of clinical indications. CONCLUSION: MRgFUS is a  promising technology evolving as a dominant tool in different functional  neurosurgery procedures in movement disorders, psychiatric disorders, epilepsy,  among others.","2022-01","2024-03-06 17:04:45","2024-03-06T17:04:45Z","","17-22","","1","156","","J Neurooncol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

However, the biomolecular and cellular  mechanisms by which focused ultrasound excites mammalian neurons have remained  unclear, posing significant challenges for the use of this technology in research  and potential clinical applications. Here, we show that focused ultrasound  excites primary murine cortical neurons in culture through a primarily mechanical  mechanism mediated by specific calcium-selective mechanosensitive ion channels.  The activation of these channels results in a gradual build-up of calcium, which  is amplified by calcium- and voltage-gated channels, generating a burst firing  response. Cavitation, temperature changes, large-scale deformation, and synaptic  transmission are not required for this excitation to occur. Pharmacological and  genetic inhibition of specific ion channels leads to reduced responses to  ultrasound, while over-expressing these channels results in stronger ultrasonic  stimulation. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the effect of  ultrasound on neurons to facilitate the further development of ultrasonic  neuromodulation and sonogenetics as tools for neuroscience research.","2022-01-25","2024-03-06 17:04:42","2024-03-06T17:04:42Z","","493","","1","13","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

Thus, technologies that allow precise control of peripheral  nerve activity have the potential to regulate a wide range of biological  processes. Noninvasive modulation of neuronal activity is an important  translational application of focused ultrasound (FUS). Recent studies have  identified effective strategies to modulate brain circuits; however, reliable  parameters to control the activity of the PNS are lacking. To develop robust  noninvasive technologies for peripheral nerve modulation, we employed targeted  FUS stimulation and electrophysiology in mouse ex vivo skin-saphenous nerve  preparations to record the activity of individual mechanosensory neurons.  Parameter space exploration showed that stimulating neuronal receptive fields  with high-intensity, millisecond FUS pulses reliably and repeatedly evoked  one-to-one action potentials in all peripheral neurons recorded. Interestingly,  when neurons were classified based on neurophysiological properties, we  identified a discrete range of FUS parameters capable of exciting all neuronal  classes, including myelinated A fibers and unmyelinated C fibers. Peripheral  neurons were excited by FUS stimulation targeted to either cutaneous receptive  fields or peripheral nerves, a key finding that increases the therapeutic range  of FUS-based peripheral neuromodulation. FUS elicited action potentials with  millisecond latencies compared with electrical stimulation, suggesting ion  channel–mediated mechanisms. Indeed, FUS thresholds were elevated in neurons  lacking the mechanically gated channel PIEZO2. Together, these results  demonstrate that transcutaneous FUS drives peripheral nerve activity by engaging  intrinsic mechanotransduction mechanisms in neurons [B. U.

Numerous focal therapy modalities are currently available with early  data demonstrating highly variable rates of cancer control and preservation of  sexual/urinary function. METHODS: All English language clinical trial  publications evaluating various focal therapies for localized prostate cancer  were reviewed. The literature search was limited to studies from the modern era  of MRI-guided treatment, as MRI is hypothesized to improve tumor localization and  targeting. Primary outcomes were post-treatment cancer-free rates,  in-field/out-of-field recurrence rates, and rates of conversion to radical  therapy. Secondary outcomes were related to functional status and adverse events.  RESULTS: Numerous focal therapies were identified with clinical data including  high-intensity focused ultrasound, transurethral ultrasound ablation, focal laser  ablation, focal cryotherapy, irreversible electroporation, and photodynamic  therapy. Recurrence rates among all technologies were low to moderate (0-51%) and  rates of freedom from radical treatment were highly variable (46-98%). Rates of  erectile dysfunction and incontinence generally ranged from 0 to 44% and 0 to  12%, respectively, with variability between focal therapy modalities. Caution  should be exercised when comparing studies as outcomes are strongly associated  with patient selection. No individual focal therapy is currently recommended by  society guidelines. Randomized controlled trials are ongoing in search of a  standard of care. CONCLUSION: For localized MRI-visible prostate cancer, early  clinical trial data demonstrate that focal therapy can provide good to moderate  cancer control while having preferable side effect profiles compared to  whole-gland treatments. While current studies do not make head-to-head  comparisons between technologies, early data suggest a potential for these  technologies to provide adequate cancer control in a well-selected patient  population. The oncologic outcomes of some focal therapies appear promising;  however, longer-term follow-up data are needed to assess the durability of early  outcomes.","2023-06","2024-03-06 17:04:38","2024-03-06T17:04:38Z","","218-227","","2","26","","Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

RESULTS: Trastuzumab was derivatized with  p-SCN-BnDTPA to introduce Bn-DTPA for complexing (111)In, then modified with  maleimide groups for conjugation to the thiol on cysteine in NLS peptides  [CGYGPKKKRKVGG].

The  Gilmore-Akulichev model coupled with the Zener viscoelastic model is used to  model the bubble dynamics. The threshold pressures are determined with two  criteria, one based on the bubble radius and the other on the bubble collapse  speed. The threshold behavior is investigated for different initial bubble sizes,  acoustic signal modes, frequencies, tissue viscosities, tissue elasticities, and  all their combinations. Due to the large number of parameters and their many  combinations (around 1.5 billion for each threshold criterion), all simulations  were executed on graphics processing units to speed up the calculations. We used  our own code written in the C++ and CUDA C languages. The results obtained  demonstrate that using the dual-frequency signal mode can help to reduce the  inertial cavitation threshold (in comparison to the single-frequency mode). The  criterion based on the bubble size gives a lower threshold than the criterion  using the bubble collapse speed. With an increase of the elasticity, the  threshold pressure also increases, whereas changing the viscosity has a very  small impact on the optimal threshold, unlike the elasticity. A detailed analysis  of the optimal ultrasound frequencies for a dual-frequency driving signal found  that for viscosities less than 0.02 Pa·s, the first optimal frequency, in  general, is much smaller than the second optimal frequency, which can reach  1 MHz. However, for high viscosities, both optimal frequencies are similar and  varied in the range 0.01-0.05 MHz. Overall, this study presents a detailed  analysis of inertial cavitation in soft tissue under dual-frequency signal  excitation. It may be helpful for the further development of different  applications of biomedical ultrasound.","2022-08","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","106056","","","88","","Ultrason Sonochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Therefore, this study aimed to develop a biological targeting  synergistic system consisting of genetically engineered bacteria and  multi-functional nanoparticles to overcome these limitations. Escherichia coli  was genetically modified to carry an acoustic reporter gene encoding the  formation of gas vesicles (GVs) and then target the tumor hypoxic environment in  mice. After E. coli producing GVs (GVs-E. coli) colonized the tumor target area,  ultrasound imaging and collaborative FUAS were performed; multi-functional  nanoparticles were then enriched in the tumor target area through electrostatic  adsorption. Multi-functional cationic lipid nanoparticles containing IR780,  perfluorohexane, and banoxantrone dihydrochloride (AQ4N) were coloaded in the  tumor to realize targeted multimodal imaging and enhance the curative effect of  FUAS. AQ4N was stimulated by the tumor hypoxic environment and synergistically  cooperated with FUAS to kill tumor cells. In sum, synergistic tumor therapy  involving multi-functional nanoparticles mediated by genetically engineered  bacteria overcomes the limitations and improves the curative effect of existing  FUAS. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Inadequate tumor targeting, single image  monitoring mode, and prone tumor recurrence following surgery remain significant  challenges yet critical for tumor therapy. This study proposes a strategy for  genetically engineered bacteria-mediated multifunctional nanoparticles for  synergistic tumor therapy. The multifunctional genetically engineered biological  targeting synergistic agent can accomplish tumor-targeting therapy, synergistic  FUAS ablation, hypoxia-activated chemotherapy combined with FUAS ablation, and  multiple-imaging guidance and monitoring all at the same time, thereby  compensating for the shortcomings of FUAS treatment. This strategy could pave the  way for the progress of tumor therapy.","2022-09-15","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","337-352","","","150","","Acta Biomater","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022.

Although identification of the functional  topography of the STN has therapeutic implications in the treatment of the motor  features of Parkinson's disease (PD), the details of its functional and  somatotopic organization in humans are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of  this study was to characterize the functional organization of the STN and its  correlation with the motor outcomes induced by subthalamotomy. METHODS: We used  diffusion-weighted imaging to assess STN connectivity patterns in 23 healthy  control subjects and 86 patients with PD, of whom 39 received unilateral  subthalamotomy. Analytical tractography was used to reconstruct structural  cortico-subthalamic connectivity. A diffusion-weighted imaging/functional  magnetic resonance imaging-driven somatotopic parcellation of the STN was defined  to delineate the representation of the upper and lower limb in the STN. RESULTS:  We confirmed a connectional gradient to sensorimotor, supplementary-motor,  associative, and limbic cortical regions, spanning from posterior-dorsal-lateral  to anterior-ventral-medial portions of the STN, with intermediate overlapping  zones. Functional magnetic resonance imaging-driven parcellation demonstrated  dual segregation of motor cortico-subthalamic projections in humans. Moreover,  the relationship between lesion topography and functional anatomy of the STN  explains specific improvement in bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor induced by  subthalamotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support an interplay between segregation  and integration of cortico-subthalamic projections, suggesting the coexistence of  parallel and convergent information processing.

However, it remains a challenge for  OR-PAM to achieve a high imaging speed and a large field of view at the same  time. In this work, we report a new approach to implement high-speed wide-field  OR-PAM, using a cylindrically-focused transparent ultrasound transducer (CFT-UT).  The CFT-UT is made of transparent lithium niobate coated with indium-tin-oxide as  electrodes. A transparent cylindrical lens is attached to the transducer surface  to provide an acoustic focal line with a length of 9 mm. The excitation light can  pass directly through the CFT-UT from the above and thus enables a reflection  imaging mode. High-speed imaging is achieved by fast optical scanning of the  focused excitation light along the CFT-UT focal line. With the confocal alignment  of the optical excitation and acoustic detection, a relatively high detection  sensitivity is maintained over the entire scanning range. The CFT-UT-based OR-PAM  system has achieved a cross-sectional frame rate of 500 Hz over the scanning  range of 9 mm. We have characterized the system's performance on phantoms and  demonstrated its application on small animal models in vivo. We expect the new  CFT-UT-based OR-PAM will find matched biomedical applications that need high  imaging speed over a large field of view.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","100417","","","28","","Photoacoustics","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Authors.","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 36299642  PMCID: PMC9589025","","","","Brain imaging; Cylindrically-focused ultrasound transducer; High-speed imaging; Optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy; Transparent ultrasound transducer; Wide-field imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The bioactive NO level in the  cardiomyocytes was much reduced during sepsis. However, it is clinically  challenging for the NO gas therapy due to the lack of spatial and temporal  release system with precise control. The purpose of this study is to design a  NO-releasing biomaterial with heart-targeted capability responsive to the  infectious microenvironment, thus ameliorating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  cardiac dysfunction. RESULTS: The heart-targeted NO delivery and in situ  releasing system, PCM-MSN@LA, was synthesized using hollow mesoporous silica  nanoparticles (MSN) as the carrier, and L-arginine (LA) as the NO donor. The  myocardial delivery was successfully directed to heart by specific peptide (PCM)  combined with low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) guidance. The myocardial  system synthesized NO from the LA released from PCM-MSN@LA in the presence of  increased endogenous nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity induced by LPS. This  targeted NO release in situ achieved extraordinary protective effects against  LPS-challenged myocardial injury by reducing the recruitment of inflammatory  cells, inhibiting oxidative stress and maintaining the mitochondria integrity. In  particular, this protection was not compromised by simultaneous circulation  collapse as an adverse event in the context. CONCLUSIONS: PCM-MSN@LA + LIFU  exhibited extraordinary cardioprotective effects against severe sepsis in the  hearts of LPS-treated animals without the side effect of NO diffusion. This  technology has great potential to be served as a novel therapeutic strategy for  sepsis-induced myocardial injury.","2022-06-07","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","263","","1","20","","J Nanobiotechnology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

However, one of the major disadvantages of  conventional FUS treatment is the small lesion size, which prolongs treatment  duration. We constructed a focused acoustic vortex (FAV) system with a hollow  cylindrical focal region, which exhibited a larger focal region compared to  conventional FUS of the same frequency. We developed an all-in-one synergistic  therapy against metastatic breast cancer based on integrated FAV double  combination sequence-regulated phase-transformation nanodroplets (CPDA@PFH) with  checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. A single treatment with FAV + CPDA@PFH  resulted in 2.25-fold higher inhibition of tumor growth compared to that with FUS  + CPDA@PFH. In addition, FAV-regulated CPDA@PFH combined with ICB induced a  systemic immune response that not only inhibited the growth of primary (98.41%  inhibition rate) and distal (80.71%) 4T1 tumors but also reduced the progression  of lung metastasis. In addition, the synergistic therapy achieved long-term  immune memory that effectively prevented tumor growth and improved the survival  time of mice. The long-term survival rate of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice treated with  FAV + CPDA@PFH + Anti-PD-L1 was 57.14% on day 60 after treatment.

This study aims to collect and  analyze data in the published literature regarding the hysteroscopic management  of CSPs focusing on efficacy and complications. Using a protocol registered with  Prospero (#CRD42021242314), the electronic databases PubMed/Medline, Scopus,  Clinical-Trials.gov and the Cochrane Library were comprehensively searched, from  their inception to June 2020. Medical Subject Headings terms such as caesarean  ectopic, hysteroscopy and endoscopy were used for the identification of the  relevant records. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to design the present systematic  review. Eligible articles assessing the role of hysteroscopy in CSP were  considered the studies published in peer-reviewed journals. Any studies with less  than 10 cases or articles that insufficiently detailed the treatment regimen, the  outcomes, and the success rate, were excluded. Selected articles were assessed  for the level of evidence, based on Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine  guidelines. The methodologic quality, including the risk of bias, was evaluated  with the employment of the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality  Assessment Tool. Ten out of 613 studies were included in the present review  comprising 812 women with CSP treated by hysteroscopy. The treatment modalities  were divided into three categories: (i) hysteroscopic resection of CSP, (ii)  hysteroscopy after preoperative use of HIFU and (iii) preoperative use of UAE  before hysteroscopic treatment. The overall success rate of hysteroscopic  treatment on CSP cases was 91%, whereas the rate of hemorrhage or excessive  vaginal bleeding (>500 mL) and the rate of hysterectomy were 1.66% and 0.28%  respectively. According to the results of this systematic review, hysteroscopy  appears to be a safe and effective procedure for CSP management. Current findings  are primarily based on retrospective studies with poor methodological quality.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Single unit  Electromyographic recordings of gastrocnemius muscle activity were obtained in  response to electrical activation of the sciatic nerve, in anesthetized animal,  with and without US stimulation. Reflex related potentials were evoked via  electrical stimulation and low-intensity, low-frequency ultrasound was applied to  the sciatic nerve. Electromyogram (EMG) was recorded from the gastrocnemius  muscle and amplitude and area under the curve were analyzed to determine the  effect of ultrasound stimulation on potentials in the reflex arc. Thermal imaging  was used to assess thermal effects of US stimulation and immunohistochemical was  performed post-US stimulation assess potential damage to the nerve. RESULTS: Our  results show a drop in electromyogram amplitudes as high as 20%, and a drop in  areas under the curve as high as 23%, with greater effects at lower frequencies  (200 kHz) and lower acoustic intensities. The suppression of EMG scales with the  magnitude of the electrical stimuli. Also, our results demonstrated transient  reversibility of US suppression and our experiments eliminated thermal effects  and mechanical and thermal damage. CONCLUSION: The non-invasiveness of US  stimulation and its inhibitory and reversible effects emphasize the potential of  US as a therapeutic modality and clinical tool for suppression of neural  potentials in the reflex arc such as the case for pain treatments. The study lays  the ground for potential applications of US stimulation in pain treatment.","2022-12","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","271-282","","4","27","","J Peripher Nerv Syst","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Peripheral Nerve Society.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36161403","","","","*Evoked Potentials; *Reflex/physiology; Animals; Electric Stimulation/methods; Electromyography; Neuromodulation; Neurostimulation; Pain; Reflex arc; Sciatic nerve; Suppression; Ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As  the acoustic radiation force is proportional to the applied acoustic intensity,  measured MR-ARFI displacements could potentially be used to estimate the acoustic  intensity at the target. However, variable brain stiffness is an obstacle. The  goal of this study was to develop and assess a method to accurately estimate the  acoustic intensity at the focus using MR-ARFI displacements in combination with  viscoelastic properties obtained with multifrequency MR elastography (MRE).  METHODS: Phantoms with a range of viscoelastic properties were fabricated, and  MR-ARFI displacements were acquired within each phantom using multiple acoustic  intensities. Voigt model parameters were estimated for each phantom based on  storage and loss moduli measured using multifrequency MRE, and these were used to  predict the relationship between acoustic intensity and measured displacement.  RESULTS: Using assumed viscoelastic properties, MR-ARFI displacements alone could  not accurately estimate acoustic intensity across phantoms. For example, acoustic  intensities were underestimated in phantoms stiffer than the assumed stiffness  and overestimated in phantoms softer than the assumed stiffness. This error was  greatly reduced using individualized viscoelasticity measurements obtained from  MRE. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that viscoelasticity information from MRE could  be used in combination with MR-ARFI displacements to obtain more accurate  estimates of acoustic intensity. Additionally, Voigt model viscosity parameters  were found to be predictive of the relaxation rate of each phantom's time-varying  displacement response, which could be used to optimize patient-specific MR-ARFI  pulse sequences.","2022-10","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1673-1689","","4","88","","Magn Reson Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 35762849  PMCID: PMC9439407","","","","*Elasticity Imaging Techniques/methods; Acoustics; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Humans; MR-ARFI; MRgFUS; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Phantoms, Imaging; acoustic radiation force imaging; elastography; transcranial focused ultrasound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Apart from thermodesorption, no  extraction step was ever performed in situ within the context of biomarker  detection experiments. This work presents an extraction protocol compatible with  in situ space constraints. Two extraction methods, i.e., microwave-assisted  extraction (MAE) and focused ultrasonic extraction (FUSE), were optimized with  the aim of extracting molecules having an astrobiological interest (amino acids,  nucleobases, polyaromatic carboxylic acids) and that are included in mineral  matrices representative of the Martian soil. Higher efficiency was obtained with  the FUSE method (20 kHz, amplitude 80%, pulse and relaxation 1 s each, for  10 min) with yields ranging from 30 to 95%. It was then applied on an Atacama  Desert soil sample and Aguas Zarcas meteorite fragment. Both water-soluble and  organic-soluble compounds present at trace levels were extracted using this short  extraction time, and small amounts of sample and solvent compliant with in situ  requirements (50 mg, 500 μL). This unique FUSE/derivatization-GC-MS approach gave  similar yields to usual 24 h hot water extraction and increased the recovery of  the target molecules compared to the derivatization-GC-MS method already used for  in situ space experiments by a factor from 2 to 8. The data highlighted the  suitability of a focused ultrasonic method for the extraction of trace organic  compounds from extraterrestrial samples.","2022-05","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","3643-3651","","12","414","","Anal Bioanal Chem","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022.

With the additional ability to modulate  regional brain tissue excitability, FUS is anticipated to confer potential  neurotherapeutic applications whereby a deeper insight of its safety is  warranted. We investigated the effects of FUS applied to the rat brain  (Sprague-Dawley) shortly after an intracortical injection of fluorescent  interstitial solutes, a widely used convection-enhanced delivery technique that  directly (i.e., bypassing the blood-brain-barrier (BBB)) introduces drugs or  interstitial tracers to the brain parenchyma. Texas Red ovalbumin (OA) and  fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-d) were used as the interstitial  tracers. Rats that did not receive sonication showed an expected interstitial  distribution of OA and FITC-d around the injection site, with a wider volume  distribution of OA (21.8 ± 4.0 µL) compared to that of FITC-d (7.8 ± 2.7 µL).  Remarkably, nearly half of the rats exposed to the FUS developed intracerebral  hemorrhaging (ICH), with a significantly higher volume of bleeding compared to a  minor red blood cell extravasation from the animals that were not exposed to  sonication. This finding suggests that the local cerebrovascular injury inflicted  by the micro-injection was further exacerbated by the application of sonication,  particularly during the acute stage of injury.

Previously, the  authors reported the short-term safety and feasibility of FUS BBB opening of the  hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) in patients with AD. Given the need to  treat larger brain regions beyond the hippocampus and EC, brain volumes and  locations treated with FUS have now expanded. To evaluate any potential adverse  consequences of BBB opening on disease progression, the authors report safety,  imaging, and clinical outcomes among participants with mild AD at 6-12 months  after FUS treatment targeted to the hippocampus, frontal lobe, and parietal lobe.  METHODS: In this open-label trial, participants with mild AD underwent MRI-guided  FUS sonication to open the BBB in β-amyloid positive regions of the hippocampus,  EC, frontal lobe, and parietal lobe. Participants underwent 3 separate FUS  treatment sessions performed 2 weeks apart. Outcome assessments included safety,  imaging, neurological, cognitive, and florbetaben β-amyloid PET. RESULTS: Ten  participants (range 55-76 years old) completed 30 separate FUS treatments at 2  participating institutions, with 6-12 months of follow-up. All participants had  immediate BBB opening after FUS and BBB closure within 24-48 hours. All FUS  treatments were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to the  procedure. All 10 participants had a minimum of 6 months of follow-up, and 7  participants had a follow-up out to 1 year. Changes in the Alzheimer's Disease  Assessment Scale-cognitive and Mini-Mental State Examination scores were  comparable to those in controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging  Initiative. PET scans demonstrated an average β-amyloid plaque of 14% in the  Centiloid scale in the FUS-treated regions. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the  largest cohort of participants with mild AD who received FUS treatment, and has  the longest follow-up to date. Safety was demonstrated in conjunction with  reversible and repeated BBB opening in multiple cortical and deep brain  locations, with a concomitant reduction of β-amyloid. There was no apparent  cognitive worsening beyond expectations up to 1 year after FUS treatment,  suggesting that the BBB opening treatment in multiple brain regions did not  adversely influence AD progression. Further studies are needed to determine the  clinical significance of these findings. FUS offers a unique opportunity to  decrease amyloid plaque burden as well as the potential to deliver targeted  therapeutics to multiple brain regions in patients with neurodegenerative  disorders.","2023-07-01","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","275-283","","1","139","","J Neurosurg","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 36334289","","","","*Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging/therapy; *Blood-Brain Barrier/diagnostic imaging/metabolism; Aged; Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides/metabolism; BBB; Brain/metabolism; Cognition; FUS; Humans; Middle Aged; Plaque, Amyloid; blood-brain barrier opening; focused ultrasound; surgical technique; β-amyloid plaque","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the fact that biomarkers and methods of treating AD are  currently being actively studied, there is still no therapy that can  significantly reduce the progression of this disease. Therefore, the search for  therapeutic disease-modifying strategies is becoming increasingly popular. One  such strategy is the use of focused ultrasound (FUS) under MRI guidance using a  contrast agent (microbubbles). Under the influence of low-intensity FUS, the  blood-brain barrier (BBB) is temporarily opened, which is the main obstacle to  the effective delivery of therapeutic compounds to the brain, imposing  dimensional and biochemical restrictions on the passage of molecules. One of the  processes associated with AD is BBB dysfunction, and therefore the study of the  effects of FUS in patients with AD is of interest. The literature data show the  effectiveness of FUS in animal models of AD. The researchers attribute the  effectiveness of the method to the fact that exposure to FUS induces the opening  of BBB and reduces the number of amyloid plaques. It has also been demonstrated  that FUS can facilitate the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain. This  allows considering FUS as a new non-invasive method of treatment. Further  research is needed to assess the effectiveness of this method in patients with  AD.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","38-45","","10","122","","Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova","","","","","","","","rus","","","","","","","Place: Russia (Federation) PMID: 36279227","","","","*Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy; *Neurodegenerative Diseases/metabolism; Alzheimer’s disease; Animals; Biomarkers/metabolism; Blood-Brain Barrier/diagnostic imaging; Brain/diagnostic imaging/metabolism; Contrast Media/metabolism/therapeutic use; beta-amyloid; blood-brain barrier; focused ultrasound; tau Proteins; tau-protein; treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total of 37 women who met the trial of labor after HIFU (TOLAH) inclusion  criteria and 368 women who met the trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC)  inclusion criteria gave birth at Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital  between 14(th) June 2018 and 24(th) September 2021. The delivery outcomes of the  two groups were compared. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to  estimate the adjusted risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). RESULTS: In the  Qualified Candidates for TOLAH group, vaginal delivery is substantially less  common (p = 0.000). The prevalence of PPH in the Qualified Candidates for TOLAH  group is lower than in the Candidates for TOLAC group (8.82% vs 10.51%,  p = 0.534; 0% vs 2.51%, p = 0.418).

The rate  of using more than two types of uterotonic medications to promote contraction is  significantly lower in the Qualified Candidates for TOLAH group (54.05% vs  69.84%, p = 0.04), and the percentage of abnormal uterine contraction is lower in  the Qualified Candidates for TOLAH group (35.14% vs 49.18%, p = 0.072). PPH is  strongly predicted by abnormal uterine contraction (aOR: 17.177, 95%  CI:5.046 ∼ 58.472, p = 0.000), but not by HIFU (aOR:1.105; 95% CI:0.240 ∼ 5.087,  p = 0.898).

Therefore, it is  necessary to detect when cavitation occurs and track the position of cavitation  occurrence using a new passive cavitation (PC) imaging method. METHODS: An  integrated PC image, which is constructed by collecting the focused signals at  all times, does not provide information on when cavitation occurs and has poor  spatial resolution. To solve this problem, we constructed instantaneous PC images  by applying delay and sum beamforming at instantaneous time instants. By  calculating instantaneous PC images at all data acquisition times, the proposed  method can detect cavitation when it occurs by using the property that when  signals from the cavitation are focused, their amplitude becomes large, and it  can obtain a high-resolution PC image by masking out side lobes in the vicinity  of cavitation. RESULTS: Ultrasound image simulation confirmed that the proposed  method has higher resolution than conventional integrated PC imaging and showed  that it can determine the position and time of cavitation occurrence as well as  the signal strength. CONCLUSION: Since the proposed novel PC imaging method can  detect each cavitation separately when the incidence of cavitations is low, it  can be used to monitor the treatment process of shock wave therapy and  histotripsy, in which cavitation is an important mechanism of treatment.","2022-07","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","566-577","","3","41","","Ultrasonography","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Korea (South) PMID: 35535468  PMCID: PMC9262664","","","","Beamforming; Passive cavitation imaging; Strength of cavitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  main treatment option is local excision of IMP via laparoscopy or laparotomy.  PATIENT CONCERNS: A 32-year-old woman with adenomyosis presented with amenorrhea  for 7 weeks and a serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) level of 6882 IU/L.  The patient had a history of laparotomy for adenomyosis 5 years previously.  Three-dimensional ultrasonography showed a live gestational sac (GS) of  9 × 15 × 18 mm located in the left posterior wall of the uterus and a sinus tract  connecting the sac and the endometrial cavity. MRI revealed the GS located in the  adenomyosis and a 1.0-cm sinus tract connecting the GS and the endometrial  cavity. DIAGNOSES: IMP with adenomyosis. INTERVENTIONS: High-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU) treatment combined with systemic methotrexate (MTX) was  performed to treat IMP, which would avoid operation and massive bleeding.  OUTCOMES: Serum β-HCG levels decreased to normal 4 weeks after HIFU treatment and  the GS was not found on MRI after 4 months. The sinus tract was significantly  shortened after the HIFU treatment. LESSONS: HIFU ablation combined with systemic  MTX is effective for the treatment of IMP and is favorable for maintaining  fertility.","2022-11-18","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","e31615","","46","101","","Medicine (Baltimore)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

Specifically, the inner core of these NPs is mainly  composed of phase-changeable perfluorohexane (PFH), magnetic Fe(3)O(4) and ART.  In vitro experiments showed that the prepared PFH/ART@PLGA/Fe(3)O(4)-eFA was  readily taken up by 4T1 cancer cells. PFH/ART@PLGA/Fe(3)O(4)-eFA was exposed to  low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) irradiation to induce PFH phase  transition and NPs collapse, which promoted the release of ART and Fe(3)O(4).  After LIFU irradiation, the proportion of dead 4T1 cells, the level of reactive  oxygen species (ROS) and the concentration of intracellular Fe(2+) ions in the  PFH/ART@PLGA/Fe(3)O(4)-eFA group were much higher than those in the other group,  indicating that the synergistic effect between the intracellular Fe(2+) ions and  the released ART played a critical role in tumor cell ferroptosis by enhancing  ROS generation in vitro. We demonstrated that FA-modified EM NPs could enhance  the targeting and accumulation of the NPs at the tumor site in vivo. After LIFU  irradiation at 3 W/m(2) for 7 min, tumor growth was completely suppressed through  FA-modified EM NPs collapse and the release of ART and Fe(3)O(4), which exerted  synergistic effects in inducing tumor ferroptosis.

We  investigated whether focal HIFU (fHIFU) yields oncologic advantages over AS for  low-risk PCa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 2 non-randomized prospective  series of 132 (fHIFU) and 421 (AS) consecutive patients diagnosed with ISUP 1 PCa  between 2008 and 2018. A matched pair analysis was performed to decrease  potential bias. Study main outcomes were freedom from radical treatment (RT) or  androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), treatment-free survival (TFS), time to  metastasis, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Median fHIFU follow-up was 50  months (interquartile range, 29-84 months). Among matched variables, no major  differences were recorded except for AS having more suspicious digital rectal  examination findings (P = .0074) and recent enrollment year (P = .0005).  Five-year intervention-free survival from RT or ADT was higher for the fHIFU  cohort (67.4% vs. 53.8%; P = .0158). Time to treatment was approximately 10  months shorter for AS than for fHIFU (time to RT, P = .0363; time to RT or ADT,  P = .0156; time to any treatment, P = .0319). No differences were found in  any-TFS (fHIFU, 61.4% vs. AS, 53.8%; P = .2635), OS (fHIFU, 97% vs. AS, 97%; P =  .9237), or metastasis (n = 0 in fHIFU and n = 2 in AS; P = .4981). Major  complications (≥ Clavien 3) were rare (n = 4), although 36.4% of men experienced  complications. No relevant changes were noted in continence (P = .3949).  CONCLUSION: At a 4-year median follow-up, fHIFU for mainly low-risk PCa (ISUP  grade 1) is safe, may decrease the need for radical treatment or ADT and may  allow longer time to treatment compared to AS.

It is known  that the shortening of cilia length by pro-inflammatory cytokines is related to  the decreased adipogenic differentiation of ASCs via increase in Wnt5a/β-catenin.  High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is known to upregulate heat shock  proteins (HSP), which decrease levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this  study, we evaluated whether HIFU modulates the cilia of ASCs by upregulating  HSP70 and decreasing inflammatory cytokines. HIFU was applied at 0.2 J to rat  skin, which was harvested at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days. All results for HIFU-applied  animals were compared with control animals that were not treated. HIFU increased  expression of HSP70 and decreased expression of NF-κB, IL-6, and TNF-α in sWAT.  HIFU decreased the expression of cilia disassembly-related factors (AurA and  HDAC9) in ASCs. Furthermore, HIFU increased the expression of cilia  assembly-related factors (KIF3A and IFT88), decreased that of WNT5A/β-catenin,  and increased that of the adipogenesis markers PPARγ and CEBPα in sWAT. HIFU  increased the number of adipocytes in the sWAT and the thickness of sWAT. In  conclusion, HIFU could selectively increase sWAT levels by modulating the cilia  of ASCs and be used for skin rejuvenation.","2022-08-09","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","","","16","23","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 36012125  PMCID: PMC9408610","","","","*Adipogenesis/physiology; *beta Catenin/metabolism; Adipocytes/metabolism; Adipose Tissue/metabolism; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cilia; Cytokines/metabolism; Rats; Stem Cells/metabolism; Subcutaneous Fat; Ultrasonic Waves; adipogenesis; adipose-derived stem cells; cilia; high-intensity focused ultrasound; skin rejuvenation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dehydrated fibrin gels were found  to be the most similar to tendon in cavitation emission energy (fibrin = 0.69 ±  0.24, tendon = 0.64 ± 0.19 [× 10(10) V(2)]) and anisotropy (fibrin = 3.16 ± 1.12,  tendon = 19.4). Bubble cloud area in dehydrated fibrin (0.79 ± 0.14 mm(2)) was  significantly smaller than most other tested hydrogels. Finally, anisotropy was  found to have moderately strong linear relationships with cavitation energy and  bubble cloud size (r = -0.65 and -0.80, respectively).

Therefore, the  primary objective in the treatment of uterine fibroids is a sufficient symptom  relief. Ultrasound (US)-guided High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an  effective non-invasive treatment strategy for ablation of uterine fibroids that  can achieve a significant tumor volume reduction. The aim of the study is to  evaluate if US-guided HIFU treatment can reduce fibroid-associated symptoms  leading to an improvement of health-related quality of life. Fifty-five women  with symptomatic uterine fibroids underwent US-guided HIFU ablation. Clinical  evaluation was performed on the basis of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and  Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QOL) at baseline, 6 weeks, 3,  6, 9 and 12 months after HIFU. Imaging follow-up included contrast-enhanced  ultrasound (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced MRI. A significant reduction of the  Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) was observed between 6 weeks and 12 months after  HIFU (49.9 ± 19.4 at baseline vs. 42.2 ± 20.1 at 6 weeks and 23.6 ± 12.7 at  12 months after treatment, p < 0.001) correlating with a significant improvement  (p < 0.001) of Health-related Quality of Life (HRQL) (52.5 ± 22.7 at baseline vs.  59.8 ± 22 at 6 weeks and 77.9 ± 17.3 at 12 months after treatment). Significant  postinterventional improvement was observed in every subscale of HRQL. In the  majority of patients, only minor, short-lasting and self-limiting side effects  were observed, e.g. soft tissue edema of the anterior lower abdominal wall in the  acoustic pathway or transient moderate lower abdominal pain as during  menstruation. One patient with a very large fibroid experienced strong  short-lasting pain after the procedure; two patients experienced  post-procedurally a transient sciatic nerve irritation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-tumor-bearing pigs (n = 8; mean  weight, 52.5 kg) were anticoagulated with warfarin (initial dose, 0.08 mg/kg) to  a target prothrombin time (PT) of 30%-50% above baseline. A total of 15  histotripsy procedures were performed (kidney: n = 8, 2.0-cm sphere; liver: n =  7, 2.5-cm sphere). Treatments were immediately followed by computed tomography  (CT) imaging. Animals were observed for 7 days while continuing anticoagulation,  followed by repeat CT and necropsy. RESULTS: All animals survived to complete the  entire protocol with no signs of disability or distress. Three animals had  hematuria (pink urine without clots). Baseline PT values (mean, 16.0 seconds)  were elevated to 22.0 seconds (37.5% above baseline, P = .003) on the day of  treatment and to 28.8 seconds (77.8% above baseline, P < .001) on the day of  necropsy. At the time of treatment, 5 of 8 (63%) animals were at a therapeutic  anticoagulation level, and all 8 animals (100%) reached therapeutic levels by the  time of necropsy. There were no cases of intraparenchymal, peritoneal, or  retroperitoneal hemorrhage associated with any treatments despite 5 of 7 (71%)  liver and all 8 (100%) kidney treatments extending to the organ surface.  CONCLUSIONS: Liver and kidney histotripsy seems safe with no elevated bleeding  risk in this anticoagulated animal model, supporting the possibility of  histotripsy treatments in patients on anticoagulation.","2023-03","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","386-394.e2","","3","34","","J Vasc Interv Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2022 SIR.

External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is the current standard of care for treatment  of CIBP. However, approximately 45% of patients have no adequate pain response  after EBRT. Magnetic resonance image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound  (MR-HIFU) may improve pain palliation in this patient population. The main  objective of this trial was to compare MR-HIFU, EBRT, and MR-HIFU + EBRT for the  palliative treatment of bone metastases. METHODS/DESIGN: The FURTHER trial is an  international multicenter, three-armed randomized controlled trial. A total of  216 patients with painful bone metastases will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to  receive EBRT only, MR-HIFU only, or combined treatment with EBRT followed by  MR-HIFU. During a follow-up period of 6 months, patients will be contacted at  eight time points to retrieve information about their level of pain, QoL, and the  occurrence of (serious) adverse events. The primary outcome of the trial is pain  response at 14 days after start of treatment. Secondary outcomes include pain  response at 14 days after trial enrolment, pain scores (daily until the 21st day  and at 4, 6, 12 and 24 weeks), toxicity, adverse events, QoL, and survival.  Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis will be conducted. DISCUSSION: The  FURTHER trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of  MR-HIFU-alone or in combination with EBRT-compared to EBRT to relieve CIBP. The  trial will be performed in six hospitals in four European countries, all of which  are partners in the FURTHER consortium. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The FURTHER trial is  registered under the Netherlands Trials Register number NL71303.041.19 and  ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT04307914.

We validated ultrasound-guided procedure in three in vivo rat brains  by delivering MRI contrast agent to cortical regions of rat brains after BBB  opening.

High blood perfusion of heart affects the energy  deposition. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of cooling of coronary blood  flow for HIFU ablation.Continuous and pulsed HIFU (2000 J) at duty cycles of 100%  and 25% were examined for their capacity to ablate the perfused porcine heart  tissue in vitro. After ablation, grayscale changes and pathological features were  observed or measured, and the area and volume of tissue necrosis were  calculated.The cardiomyocytes in the lesions underwent necrosis with a clear  boundary. The endocardial surface was intact without necrosis. The  three-dimensional morphology of the lesions appeared approximately as ellipsoids.  With the increase in perfusion speed, the necrotic volume in the target area was  gradually reduced.HIFU has the potential to become a new minimally invasive  surgery for ventricular septal myocardial ablation. Reduction of coronary blood  flow can improve the ablation effect.","2022-11-30","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1158-1165","","6","63","","Int Heart J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 36372408","","","","*High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation/methods; Animals; Coronary blood; Heart Ventricles; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Myocytes, Cardiac; Necrosis; Septal ablation; Swine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of the HIFU device for sculpting the  abdomen, upper arm, and thigh were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten subjects  with more than 10 mm of subcutaneous fat in the abdomen, upper arm, and/or thigh  were recruited. We evaluate mean change in the thickness and circumference of  subcutaneous fat of each treated area measured using ultrasound 12 weeks after  the procedure, the degree of pain, and subject and practitioner satisfaction  12 weeks after the procedure. RESULTS: The mean change of subcutaneous fat  thickness in the abdomen, upper arm, and thigh measured using ultrasound 12 weeks  after the procedure was -4.33 ± 2.42, -1.86 ± 1.35, and -1.86 ± 1.35 mm,  respectively. Compared with pretreatment, subcutaneous fat thickness of the  abdomen and upper arm was significantly reduced (p = 0.0020 and p = 0.0004,  respectively), but not in the thigh (p = 0.0716). Highest patient satisfaction  was for the abdomen. Pain was generally tolerable. CONCLUSION: The results from  the present study indicate HIFU can be an effective and safe therapeutic modality  for removing excessive subcutaneous fat in humans.","2022-05","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","2009-2014","","5","21","","J Cosmet Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 35080337","","","","*Arm; *Thigh; Abdomen; Humans; Pain; Pilot Projects; Subcutaneous Fat/diagnostic imaging; abdomen; high-intensity focused ultrasound; thigh; upper arm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focal therapy of localized prostate  cancer aims to treat the lesion/part of the prostate that includes the index  lesion, which determines the prognosis. We performed a non-systematic review of  novel studies on focal therapy of localized prostate cancer as primary treatment  published between 2016 and 2021. For mainly intermediate-risk patients,  therapeutic technology, such as cryoablation, brachytherapy, high-intensity  focused ultrasound, photodynamic therapy, microwave-coagulation, electroporation,  and laser ablation, etc., were performed. These procedures are minimally invasive  and safe, and provide good functional outcome: a 94-100% pad-free rate against  urinary incontinence and 47-86% erectile function, which is sufficient for sexual  intercourse. Accurate three-dimensional mapping of the targeted lesion could be  an essential navigation technique for therapeutic success. Intermediate- to  short-term oncological outcomes were good, resulting in downstaging of the  patient's status to no clinically significant cancer; however, transition to  conventional whole-gland treatment was necessary in about 10-30% of patients. It  is important to select appropriate patients by both multiparametric magnetic  resonance imaging and targeted biopsy, and to follow-up postoperatively with  methods such as active surveillance. Clinically significant prostate-specific  antigen reduction, image response using preoperative and postoperative  multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, and histological analysis should be  combined for follow-up.","2022-11","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","1254-1263","","11","29","","Int J Urol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2022 The Japanese Urological Association.","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 35996758","","","","*Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/surgery; HIFU; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Male; Prostate/diagnostic imaging/surgery/pathology; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome; cryoablation; focal therapy; localized prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Laser removal requires 8-12 sessions and can easily take longer than a year. Some colors cannot  be removed, and scars may appear. Applied to allergic reactions in red tattoos,  lasers can boost the allergy. A recently developed 20 MHz high-intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU) is introduced as a complementary method to lasers, but also as  a stand-alone treatment for selected groups. 20 MHz HIFU allows for application  of high-power ultrasound energy to very small focal targets in the dermis, and  thereby precise confinement of thermal lesions in the outer layers of human skin,  precisely where tattoo inks are deposited. HIFU treatment is ""color blind"" and  can target any type of colored pigment in the dermis. It produces a controlled  thermal lesion (up to 65°C) with superficial necrosis followed by an eschar with  embedded tattoo pigment. This eschar, containing the tattoo pigment, is  discharged over some weeks, and finally replaced by healed skin. HIFU can  efficiently remove tattoos of any color in only 1-3 sessions. It can be applied  to tattoos when lasers fail to produce efficient removal. The types of side  effects are the same as with lasers. The operator shall be trained and  knowledgeable. 20 MHz HIFU can furthermore be used in clinical and esthetic  dermatology for various other applications, and a range of applications are open  in clinical dermatology.","2022","2024-03-06 16:55:22","2024-03-06T16:55:22Z","","268-280","","","56","","Curr Probl Dermatol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2023 S.
