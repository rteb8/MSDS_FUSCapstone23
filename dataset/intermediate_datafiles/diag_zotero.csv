0,"OBJECTIVE: To critically appraise and quantify the performance studies by employing machine learning (ML) to predict delirium. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Articles reporting the use of ML to predict delirium in adult patients were included. Studies were excluded if (1) the primary goal was only the identification of various risk factors for delirium; (2) the full-text article was not found; and (3) the article was published in a language other than English/Chinese. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library database, Web of Science, Grey literature, and other relevant databases for the related publications were searched (from inception to December 15, 2021). The data were extracted using a standard checklist, and the risk of bias was assessed through the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool. Meta-analysis with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity as effect measures, was performed with Metadisc software. Cochran Q and I2 statistics were used to assess the heterogeneity. Meta-regression was performed to determine the potential effect of adjustment for the key covariates. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies were included. Only 4 of 22 studies were quantitatively analyzed. The studies varied widely in reporting about the study participants, features and selection, handling of missing data, sample size calculations, and the intended clinical application of the model. For ML models, the overall pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting delirium was 0.89, sensitivity 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.84‒0.85), and specificity 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.81-0.80). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We found that the ML model showed excellent performance in predicting delirium. This review highlights the potential shortcomings of the current approaches, including low comparability and reproducibility. Finally, we present the various recommendations on how these challenges can be effectively addressed before deploying these models in prospective analyses.",0
2,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there are clinically relevant and reproducible Vasoactive Inotrope Score (VIS) trajectories in children with shock during the acute phase of critical illness. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cohort study. SETTING: Two tertiary, academic PICUs. PATIENTS: Children (< 18 yr old) who required vasoactive infusions within 24 hours of admission to the PICU. Those admitted post cardiac surgery were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An hourly VIS was calculated for the first 72 hours after initiation of vasoactives. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was applied to a derivation set (75% of encounters) and compared with the trajectories in a validation set (25% of encounters) using the same variables. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) on day 7. A total of 1,828 patients met inclusion criteria, and 309 (16.9%) died. GBTM identified four subgroups that were reproducible in the validation set: ""Mild, fast resolving shock"" (n = 853 [47%]; mortality 9%), ""Moderate, slow resolving shock"" (n = 422 [23%]; mortality 15%), ""Moderate, prolonged shock"" (n = 312 [17%]; mortality 21%), and ""Severe, prolonged shock"" (n = 241 [13%]; mortality 40%). There was a significant difference in mortality, MODS on day 7, and suspected infection (p < 0.001) across groups. The ""Mild, fast resolving shock"" and ""Severe, prolonged shock"" groups were identifiable within the first 24 hours. The ""Moderate, slow resolving"" and ""Moderate, prolonged shock"" groups were indistinguishable in the first 24 hours after initiation of vasoactives but differed in in-hospital mortality and MODS on day 7. Hydrocortisone administration was independently associated with poor outcomes in the ""Mild, fast resolving shock"" group. CONCLUSIONS: We uncovered four distinct and reproducible VIS trajectory groups that were associated with different risk factors, response to therapy, and outcomes in children with shock. Characterizing VIS trajectory groups in the acute phase of critical illness may enable better prognostication and more targeted management.",0
3,"Rationale: Delirium severity and duration are independently associated with higher mortality and morbidity. No studies to date have described a delirium trajectory by integrating both severity and duration.Objectives: The primary aim was to develop delirium trajectories by integrating symptom severity and duration. The secondary aim was to investigate the association among trajectory membership, clinical characteristics, and 30-day mortality.Methods: A secondary analysis of the PMD (Pharmacologic Management of Delirium) randomized control trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00842608; N = 531) was conducted. The presence of delirium and symptom severity were measured at least daily for 7 days using the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and CAM-ICU-7 (on a scale of 0-7, with 7 being the most severe). Delirium trajectories were defined using an innovative, data-driven statistical method (group-based trajectory modeling [GBTM]) and SAS v9.4.Results: A total of 531 delirious participants (mean age 60 yr [standard deviation = 16], 55% female, and 46% African American) were analyzed. Five distinct delirium trajectories were described (CAM-ICU-7: mean [standard deviation]); mild-brief (CAM-ICU-7: 0.5 [0.5]), severe-rapid recovers (CAM-ICU-7: 2.1 [1.0]), mild-accelerating (CAM-ICU-7: 2.2 [0.9]), severe-slow recovers (CAM-ICU-7: 3.9 [0.9]), and severe-nonrecovers (CAM-ICU-7: 5.9 [1.0]). Baseline cognition and race were associated with trajectory membership. Trajectory membership independently predicted 30-day mortality while controlling for age, sex, race, cognition, illness severity, and comorbidities.Conclusions: This secondary analysis described five distinct delirium trajectories based on delirium symptom severity and duration using group-based trajectory modeling. Trajectory membership predicted 30-day mortality.",0
4,"Delirium severity has been associated with a higher risk of mortality and an increasing morbidity burden. Recently defined delirium severity trajectories were predictive of 30-day mortality in a critically ill patient population. No studies to date have examined associations between delirium severity trajectories and 2-year mortality and healthcare utilization outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations between recently defined delirium severity trajectories and 2-year healthcare utilization outcomes of emergency department visits, rehospitalizations, and mortality. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a secondary analysis using data from the randomized controlled clinical trial Pharmacological Management of Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit and Deprescribing in the Pharmacologic Management of Delirium trial conducted from 2009 to 2015. Patients who were greater than or equal to 18 years old, were in the ICU for greater than or equal to 24 hours, and had a positive delirium assessment (Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU) were included in the original trial. Participants were included in the secondary analysis if 2-year healthcare utilization and mortality data were available (n = 431). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Healthcare utilization data within 2 years of the initial discharge date were pulled from the Indiana Network for Patient Care. Data over a 2-year period on emergency department visits (days to first emergency department visit, number of emergency department visits), inpatient hospitalizations (days to first hospitalizations, number of hospitalizations), and mortality (time to death) were extracted. Univariate relationships, Cox proportional hazard models, and competing risk modeling were used to examine statistical relationships in SAS v9.4. RESULTS: The overall sample (n = 431) had a mean age of 60 (sd, 16), 56% were females, and 49% African-Americans. No significant associations were identified between delirium severity trajectories and time to event for emergency department visit, mortality, or rehospitalization within 2 years of the index hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This secondary analysis did not identify a significant relationship between delirium severity trajectories and healthcare utilization or mortality within 2 years of hospital discharge.",0
5,"PURPOSE: We aimed to determine any associations between delirium and comas during intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and long-term psychiatric symptoms and disability affecting activity of daily living (ADL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we enrolled critically ill adult patients that were emergently admitted to an ICU. We assessed psychiatric symptoms and disability affecting ADL at three and twelve months after ICU discharge. RESULTS: Among the 81 and the 47 patients that responded to the questionnaires at three and twelve months, 22 (27%) and 13 (28%) patients experienced delirium, respectively. During their ICU stay, 28 (35%) and 21 (45%) had been in comas, respectively. At three and twelve months, 51 (63%) and 23 (49%) of patients experienced composite psychiatric symptoms or disability affecting ADL, respectively. After adjusting predefined confounders, the combination of delirium and comas was an independent risk factor for the presence of composite psychiatric symptoms or disability affecting ADL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.38; 1.10-10.38 at three months; aOR 8.28; 1.48-46.46 at twelve months). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill adults, combination of delirium and comas during ICU stay is a predictor of psychiatric symptoms or ADL disability. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trial Registry no.

6,"OBJECTIVE: The investigators aimed to describe delirium etiologies and clinical characteristics, as well as the relationship between COVID-19 and delirium severities, at baseline and follow-up after delirium improvement among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A longitudinal study of 20 consecutive critically ill, delirious COVID-19 inpatients, assessed with the Charlson Comorbidity Index-Short Form (CCI-SF), COVID-19 Clinical Severity Scale (CCSS), Delirium Etiology Checklist, Delirium Motor Subtype Scale-4, and Delirium Diagnostic Tool-Provisional (DDT-Pro), was conducted. Correlational analysis of delirium severity (DDT-Pro) with each measure of clinical severity (CCI-SF and CCSS) and comparison of baseline DDT-Pro scores between patients who were living and those who were deceased at follow-up were conducted. RESULTS: Participants were 50-90 years old (male, 75%; hypertension, 60%). The prevalence of preexisting medical comorbidities (CCI-SF) was low and not correlated with delirium severity (p=0.193). Eighteen patients were on mechanical or high-flow noninvasive ventilation at baseline in the intensive care unit (ICU; CCSS scores 2-4). Delirium severity (DDT-Pro scores 0-6) correlated with COVID-19 severity (0.459, p=0.021). Delirium motor subtype was hyperactive in 75% of patients. There were three to four etiologies for delirium in each patient, most commonly organ insufficiency (100%), systemic infection (100%), and metabolic and endocrine disturbances (95%). The baseline DDT-Pro score was ≤4 for five (25%) patients who died before the final assessment, with a trend of being lower than that for survivors (χ2=3.398, p=0.065). CONCLUSIONS: Among inpatients with COVID-19, at least three different etiological categories were identified for delirium. ICU staff treating patients with severe cases of COVID-19 should anticipate a greater severity of delirium. Although multivariate analyses with larger study samples are needed, more severe delirium may herald greater risk of death among COVID-19 patients.",0
7,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly. Delirium in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) could predict adverse clinical outcomes. METHODS: We investigated a potential link between intraoperative EEG patterns and PACU delirium as well as an association of PACU delirium with perioperative outcomes, readmission and length of hospital stay. The risk factors for PACU delirium were also explored. Data were collected from 626 patients receiving general anaesthesia for procedures that would not interfere with frontal EEG recording. RESULTS: Of the 626 subjects enrolled, 125 tested positive for PACU delirium. Whilst age, renal failure, and pre-existing neurological disease were associated with PACU delirium in the univariable analysis, the multivariable analysis revealed the importance of information derived from the EEG, anaesthetic technique, anaesthesia duration, and history of stroke or neurodegenerative disease. The occurrence of EEG burst suppression during maintenance [odds ratio (OR)=1.86 (1.13-3.05)] and the type of EEG emergence trajectory may be predictive of PACU delirium. Specifically, EEG emergence trajectories lacking significant spindle power were strongly associated with PACU delirium, especially in cases that involved ketamine or nitrous oxide [OR=6.51 (3.00-14.12)]. Additionally, subjects with PACU delirium were at an increased risk for readmission [OR=2.17 (1.13-4.17)] and twice as likely to stay >6 days in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Specific EEG patterns were associated with PACU delirium. These findings provide valuable information regarding how the brain reacts to surgery and anaesthesia that may lead to strategies to predict PACU delirium and identify key areas of investigation for its prevention.",0
8,"Longitudinal research on older persons in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) is often complicated by the time-dependent confounding of concurrently administered interventions such as medications and intubation. Such temporal confounding can bias the respective longitudinal associations between concurrently administered treatments and a longitudinal outcome such as delirium. Although marginal structural models address time-dependent confounding, their application is non-trivial and preferably justified by empirical evidence. Using data from a longitudinal study of older persons in the MICU, we constructed a plausibility score from 0 - 10 where higher values indicate higher plausibility of time-dependent confounding of the association between a time-varying explanatory variable and an outcome. Based on longitudinal plots, measures of correlation, and longitudinal regression, the plausibility scores were compared to the differences in estimates obtained with non-weighted and marginal structural models of next day delirium. The plausibility scores of the three possible pairings of daily doses of fentanyl, haloperidol, and intubation indicated the following: low plausibility for haloperidol and intubation, moderate plausibility for fentanyl and haloperidol, and high plausibility for fentanyl and intubation. Comparing multivariable models of next day delirium with and without adjustment for time-dependent confounding, only intubation's association changed substantively. In our observational study of older persons in the MICU, the plausibility scores were generally reflective of the observed differences between coefficients estimated from non-weighted and marginal structural models.",0
9,"Objectives To explore factors associated with decision-making of nurses and doctors in prescribing and administering as required antipsychotic medications to older people with delirium. Design Qualitative descriptive. Setting Two acute care hospital organisations in Melbourne, Australia. Participants Nurses and doctors were invited to participate. Semi-structured focus groups and individual interviews were conducted between May 2019 and March 2020. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. <SCRIPT language='JavaScript1.1' SRC=""https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/adj/N636.1248839.SWOOP/B28088550.344987881;abr=!ie;sz=728x90;ord=[timestamp];dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;gdpr=${GDPR};gdpr_consent=${GDPR_CONSENT_755}?""> </SCRIPT> Results Participants were 42 health professionals; n=25 nurses and n=17 doctors. Themes relating to decisions to use antipsychotic medication were: safety; a last resort; nursing workload; a dilemma to medicate; and anticipating worsening behaviours. Nurses and doctors described experiencing pressures when trying to manage hyperactive behaviours. Safety was a major concern leading to the decision to use antipsychotics. Antipsychotics were often used as chemical restraints to ‘sedate’ a patient with delirium because nurses ‘can’t do their job’. Results also indicated that nurses had influence over doctors’ decisions despite nurses being unaware of this influence. Health professionals’ descriptions are illustrated in a decision-making flowchart that identifies how nurses and doctors navigated decisions regarding prescription and administration of antipsychotic medications. Conclusions The decision to prescribe and administer antipsychotic medications for people with delirium is complex as nurses and doctors must navigate multiple factors before making the decision. Collaborative support and multidisciplinary teamwork are required by both nurses and doctors to optimally care for people with delirium. Decision-making support for nurses and doctors may also help to navigate the multiple factors that influence the decision to prescribe antipsychotics.",0
10,"Background Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with increased mortality, longer hospital stays, and increased odds of institutionalization after discharge. Delirium is a significant complication that occurs frequently in ICU yet lacks a standardized treatment protocol. Because of the limited effective pharmacologic treatments available for the management of delirium, non-pharmacologic interventions such as early mobilization, earplugs and blinds at night, music and natural sunlight during the day, continuous reorientation, and increased visitation and family participation are essential to integrate into the treatment plan for the management of delirium in the ICU. Aim To summarize evidence on the use of non-pharmacologic interventions for the reduction in incidence and duration of delirium in ICU patients and to integrate qualitative studies that explore the perception of delirium in the ICU from staff and patients' families to support the use of non-pharmacologic interventions. Methods For this integrative review, electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were searched using the guidance of a librarian and second reviewer to find qualitative and quantitative studies that were published after 2005 and involved adult patients in the ICU. Conclusion Eight quantitative articles and four qualitative articles were chosen to be included in this review. All eight quantitative studies provide significant evidence (P < .05) for the efficacy of their interventions to provide benefit to at least one delirium-related outcome. The four qualitative research studies reviewed provide insight on delirium in the ICU from staff and patients' families who share a desire for the use of effective non-pharmacologic interventions. Relevance to clinical practice Non-pharmacologic interventions used for patients in the ICU may be efficacious in reducing the incidence and duration of delirium in adults. Non-pharmacologic interventions are feasible and supported by ICU staff and patients' families and should be considered in the care of the critically ill patient.",0
11,"INTRODUCTION: Despite recommendations from professional societies and patient safety organizations, the majority of ICU patients worldwide are not routinely monitored for delirium, thus preventing timely prevention and management. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize what types of implementation strategies have been tested to improve ICU clinicians' ability to effectively assess, prevent and treat delirium and to evaluate the effect of these strategies on clinical outcomes. METHOD: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, Cochrane and CINAHL (January 2000 and April 2014) for studies on implementation strategies that included delirium-oriented interventions in adult ICU patients. Studies were suitable for inclusion if implementation strategies' efficacy, in terms of a clinical outcome, or process outcome was described. RESULTS: We included 21 studies, all including process measures, while 9 reported both process measures and clinical outcomes. Some individual strategies such as ""audit and feedback"" and ""tailored interventions"" may be important to establish clinical outcome improvements, but otherwise robust data on effectiveness of specific implementation strategies were scarce. Successful implementation interventions were frequently reported to change process measures, such as improvements in adherence to delirium screening with up to 92%, but relating process measures to outcome changes was generally not possible. In meta-analyses, reduced mortality and ICU length of stay reduction were statistically more likely with implementation programs that employed more (six or more) rather than less implementation strategies and when a framework was used that either integrated current evidence on pain, agitation and delirium management (PAD) or when a strategy of early awakening, breathing, delirium screening and early exercise (ABCDE bundle) was employed. Using implementation strategies aimed at organizational change, next to behavioral change, was also associated with reduced mortality. CONCLUSION: Our findings may indicate that multi-component implementation programs with a higher number of strategies targeting ICU delirium assessment, prevention and treatment and integrated within PAD or ABCDE bundle have the potential to improve clinical outcomes. However, prospective confirmation of these findings is needed to inform the most effective implementation practice with regard to integrated delirium management and such research should clearly delineate effective practice change from improvements in clinical outcomes.",0
12,"BACKGROUND: Delirium during critical illness results from numerous insults, which might be interconnected and yet individually contribute to long-term cognitive impairment. We sought to describe the prevalence and duration of clinical phenotypes of delirium (ie, phenotypes defined by clinical risk factors) and to understand associations between these clinical phenotypes and severity of subsequent long-term cognitive impairment. METHODS: In this multicentre, prospective cohort study, we included adult (≥18 years) medical or surgical ICU patients with respiratory failure, shock, or both as part of two parallel studies: the Bringing to Light the Risk Factors and Incidence of Neuropsychological Dysfunction in ICU Survivors (BRAIN-ICU) study, and the Delirium and Dementia in Veterans Surviving ICU Care (MIND-ICU) study. We assessed patients at least once a day for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU and identified a priori-defined, non-mutually exclusive phenotypes of delirium per the presence of hypoxia, sepsis, sedative exposure, or metabolic (eg, renal or hepatic) dysfunction. We considered delirium in the absence of hypoxia, sepsis, sedation, and metabolic dysfunction to be unclassified. 3 and 12 months after discharge, we assessed cognition with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). We used multiple linear regression to separately analyse associations between the duration of each phenotype of delirium and RBANS global cognition scores at 3-month and 12-month follow-up, adjusting for potential confounders. FINDINGS: Between March 14, 2007, and May 27, 2010, 1048 participants were enrolled, eight of whom could not be analysed. Of 1040 participants, 708 survived to 3 months of follow-up and 628 to 12 months. Delirium was common, affecting 740 (71%) of 1040 participants at some point during the study and occurring on 4187 (31%) of all 13 434 participant-days. A single delirium phenotype was present on only 1355 (32%) of all 4187 participant-delirium days, whereas two or more phenotypes were present during 2832 (68%) delirium days. Sedative-associated delirium was most common (present during 2634 [63%] delirium days), and a longer duration of sedative-associated delirium predicted a worse RBANS global cognition score 12 months later, after adjusting for covariates (difference in score comparing 3 days vs 0 days: -4·03, 95% CI -7·80 to -0·26). Similarly, longer durations of hypoxic delirium (-3·76, 95% CI -7·16 to -0·37), septic delirium (-3·67, -7·13 to -0·22), and unclassified delirium (-4·70, -7·16 to -2·25) also predicted worse cognitive function at 12 months, whereas duration of metabolic delirium did not (1·14, -0·12 to 3·01). INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that clinicians should consider sedative-associated, hypoxic, and septic delirium, which often co-occur, as distinct indicators of acute brain injury and seek to identify all potential risk factors that may impact on long-term cognitive impairment, especially those that are iatrogenic and potentially modifiable such as sedation. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs.",0
13,"BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on clinical phenotype for delirium that occurs frequently among patients admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical pictures of delirium, and their association with clinical outcomes in CICU patients. METHODS: A total of 4,261 patients who were admitted to the CICU between September 1 2012 to December 31 2018 were retrospectively registered. Patients were excluded if they were admitted to the CICU for less than 24 hours or had missed data. Ultimately, 2,783 patients were included in the analysis. A day of delirium was defined as any day during which at least one CAM-ICU assessment was positive. The clinical risk factors of delirium were classified by the delirium phenotype, as follows; hypoxic, septic, sedative-associated, and metabolic delirium. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium was 24.4% at the index hospitalization in all CICU patients, and 22.6% within 7 days after CICU admission. The most common delirium phenotype was septic delirium (17.2%), followed by hypoxic delirium (16.8%). Multiple phenotypes were observed during most delirium days. Delirium most frequently occurred in patients with heart failure. Of all patients affected by delirium within 7 days, both ICU and hospital mortality significantly increased according to the combined number of delirium phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium occurred in a quarter of patients admitted to the modern CICU and was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Therefore, more efforts are needed to reduce the clinical risk factors of delirium, and to prevent it in order to improve clinical outcomes in the CICU.",0
14,"Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by a systemic dysregulated host response to infection. The brain is particularly susceptible to the effects of sepsis with clinical manifestations ranging from mild confusion to a deep comatose state. Sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) is a cerebral manifestation commonly occurring in patients with sepsis and is thought to occur due to a combination of neuroinflammation and disturbances in cerebral perfusion, the blood brain barrier (BBB) and neurotransmission. The neurological impairment associated with SAD can persist for months or even longer, after the initial septic episode has subsided which may impair the rehabilitation potential of sepsis survivors. Early identification and treatment of the underlying sepsis is key in the management of SAD as once present it can be difficult to control. Through the regular use of validated screening tools for delirium, cases of SAD can be identified early; this allows potentially aggravating factors to be addressed promptly. The usefulness of biomarkers, neuroimaging and electroencephalopathy (EEG) in the diagnosis of SAD remains controversial. The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines advise against the use of medications to treat delirium unless distressing symptoms are present or it is hindering the patient’s ability to wean from organ support.",0
15,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is common, distressing, and associated with poor outcomes. Despite this, delirium remains poorly recognized, resulting in worse outcomes. There is an urgent need for methods to objectively assess for delirium. Physical function has been proposed as a potential surrogate marker, but few studies have monitored physical function in the context of delirium. We examined if trajectories of physical function are affected by the presence and severity of delirium in a representative sample of hospitalized participants older than 65 years. METHOD: During hospital admissions in 2016, we assessed participants from the Delirium and Cognitive Impact in Dementia study daily for delirium and physical function, using the Hierarchical Assessment of Balance and Mobility (HABAM). We used linear mixed models to assess the effect of delirium and delirium severity during admission on HABAM trajectory. RESULTS: Of 178 participants, 58 experienced delirium during admission. Median HABAM scores in those with delirium were significantly higher (indicating worse mobility) than those without delirium. Modeling HABAM trajectories, HABAM scores at first assessment were worse in those with delirium than those without, by 0.76 (95% CI: 0.49-1.04) points. Participants with severe delirium experienced a much greater perturbance in their physical function, with an even lower value at first assessment and slower subsequent improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Physical function was worse in those with delirium compared to without. This supports the assertion that motor disturbances are a core feature of delirium and monitoring physical function, using a tool such as the HABAM, may have clinical utility as a surrogate marker for delirium and its resolution.",0
16,"OBJECTIVE: The prevalence and prognosis of delirium motor subtypes are not yet well established. We analyzed the prevalence of motor subtypes of delirium, as well as their risk factors and outcomes, among older vulnerable patients admitted for short-term management of exacerbated chronic conditions. METHODS: Cohort study of patients aged 65 and older who developed delirium while admitted to a subacute care unit for 12 months (N = 352). Confusion Assessment Method was used to determine the presence of delirium and the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale was used to define the motor subtype. Outcomes included discharge destination, mortality, readmission, and functional trajectories. RESULTS: Out of 352 patients with delirium (mean age= 87.4, 73.6% with dementia), hyperactive delirium was the most prevalent subtype (40.6%), followed by mixed (31%), hypoactive (25.9%), and nonmotor (2.6%). In multivariate models, worse preadmission functional status (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 0.97 [0.96-0.98]) and higher comorbidity (OR [95% CI] = 1.3 [1.04-1.51]) were associated with an increased risk of hypoactive delirium. In multivariate models adjusted for different variables, including disability, hypoactive delirium was associated with mortality compared with hyperactive delirium (OR [95% CI] = 4.7 [1.6-14]) and mixed delirium (OR [95% CI] = 2.0 [1.02-3.9]) and with worse functional recovery (Beta[95% CI] = -0.2 [-12.0-(-0.4)]). CONCLUSION: Delirium motor subtypes were associated with different patient characteristics and outcomes. Hypoactive delirium seems to affect more vulnerable patients and to be associated with worse outcomes. More research on the different delirium subtypes could help develop better preventive and management strategies.",0
17,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is an extremely common hospital complication. No study to date has assessed whether a priori defined covariates; type of hospital setting and year of study publication, influence the relationship between delirium and mortality. This is also the first study to examine the longitudinal trend of delirium-associated mortality over recent decades, to analyse the trajectory of our efforts in combating this disease. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO, were searched from January 1981 to May 2018 for English-language primary articles. Rigorous title and abstract screen and full-text screen were conducted independently by two reviewers. This paper adhered to MOOSE guidelines. Data was extracted independently by one reviewer using standardised data-collection sheets, with a separate reviewer verifying for accuracy. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Unadjusted effect sizes and event counts were analysed with a random effects model in primary meta-analysis and meta-regression, whereas a mixed effect model was used in secondary sub-group analysis. Mortality data at longest follow-up and cumulative mortality (hospital mortality combined with mortality at longest follow-up) data were analysed. RESULTS: As part of a larger project, 446 of 6790 articles were retrieved, including 71 studies that measured mortality. Our results demonstrate that elderly inpatients with delirium had significantly greater odds of mortality (OR 3.18 [95%CI: 2.73, 3.70]) compared to non-delirious controls. Patients with delirium in the ICU had the highest odds for mortality (OR: 7.09 [95%CI: 3.60, 14.0]); double the risk compared to the average. Curiously, despite advancements in delirium research, delirium associated in-hospital odds of mortality has not changed in 30 years. CONCLUSION: This is the largest meta-analysis to confirm the association between delirium and mortality, in older (age ≥ 65) hospital inpatients. The current meta-analysis highlights the significant odds of mortality after an episode of delirium, and these odds are much higher for ICU patients. However, in contrast to other medical conditions that have seen a decrease in associated mortality over the past few decades, delirium associated mortality remains unchanged. These findings underscore the urgent need for better delirium treatments. PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42018098627, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=98627.",0
18,"BACKGROUND: Subsyndromal delirium (SSD), a subthreshold form of delirium, is related to longer length of stay and increased mortality rates among older adults. Risk factors and outcomes of SSD in cardiac surgery patients are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess and describe the characteristics and outcomes related to trajectories of SSD and delirium in cardiac surgery patients. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of a retrospective case-control (1:1) cohort study, SSD was defined as a score between 1 and 3 on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist paired with an absence of diagnosis of delirium on the day of assessment. Potential risk factors (eg, age) and outcomes (eg, mortality) were identified from existing literature. Patients were grouped into 4 trajectories: (1) without SSD or delirium, (2) SSD only, (3) both, and (4) delirium only. These trajectories were contrasted using analysis of variance or χ2 test. RESULTS: Among the cohort of 346 patients, 110 patients did not present with SSD or delirium, 62 presented with only SSD, 69 presented with both, and 105 presented with only delirium. In comparison with patients without SSD or delirium, patients with SSD presented preoperative risk factors known for delirium (ie, older age, higher European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II) but underwent less complicated surgical procedures, received fewer transfusions postoperatively, and had a lower positive fluid balance postoperatively than patients who presented with delirium. Patients with both SSD and delirium had worse outcomes in comparison with those with delirium only. CONCLUSION: This study stresses the importance for healthcare professionals to identify SSD and prevent its progression to delirium.",0
19,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors for each area of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and to determine their effect size. REVIEW METHOD USED: This study used systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library were searched. REVIEW METHODS: Eighty-nine studies were selected for the review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The PICS areas and risk factors reported in the individual studies were reviewed and categorised. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the quality of studies. The effect size of each risk factor was calculated as odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: There were 33 mental health studies, 15 cognitive impairment studies, 32 physical impairment studies, eight studies on two areas, and one study on all three areas. Sixty risk factors were identified, including 33 personal and 27 intensive care unit (ICU)-related factors. Significant risk factors for mental health included female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 3.37, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-10.17), previous mental health problems (OR = 9.45, 95% CI: 2.08-42.90), and negative ICU experience (OR = 2.59, 95% CI: 2.04-3.28). The only significant risk factor for cognitive impairment was delirium (OR = 2.85, 95% CI: 1.10-7.38). Significant risk factors for physical impairment included older age (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.11-4.33), female sex (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.32-2.91), and high disease severity (OR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.76-3.66). CONCLUSIONS: Although PICS is a multidimensional concept, each area has been studied separately. Significant risk factors for PICS included older age, female sex, previous mental health problems, disease severity, negative ICU experience, and delirium. To prevent PICS, the multidisciplinary team should pay attention to modifiable risk factors such as delirium and patients' ICU experience.",0
20,"CONTEXT: Over the past several decades, advances in pediatric critical care have saved many lives. As such, contemporary care has broadened its focus to also include minimizing morbidity. Post Intensive Care Syndrome, also known as ""PICS,"" is a group of cognitive, physical, and mental health impairments that commonly occur in patients after ICU discharge. Post Intensive Care Syndrome has been well-conceptualized in the adult population but not in children. OBJECTIVE: To develop a conceptual framework describing Post Intensive Care Syndrome in pediatrics that includes aspects of the experience that are unique to children and their families. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Post Intensive Care Syndrome in pediatrics (PICS-p) framework highlights the importance of baseline status, organ system maturation, psychosocial development, the interdependence of family, and trajectories of health recovery that can potentially impact a child's life for decades. CONCLUSION: Post Intensive Care Syndrome in pediatrics will help illuminate the phenomena of surviving childhood critical illness and guide outcomes measurement in the field. Empirical studies are now required to validate and refine this framework, and to subsequently develop a set of core outcomes for this population. With explication of Post Intensive Care Syndrome in pediatrics, the discipline of pediatric critical care will then be in a stronger position to map out recovery after pediatric critical illness and to evaluate interventions designed to mitigate risk for poor outcomes with the goal of optimizing child and family health.",0
21,"Critical illness can be lethal and devastating to survivors. Improvements in acute care have increased the number of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors. These survivors confront a range of new or worsened health states that collectively are commonly denominated post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). These problems include physical, cognitive, psychological, and existential aspects, among others. Burgeoning interest in improving long-term outcomes for ICU survivors has driven an array of potential interventions to improve outcomes associated with PICS. To date, the most promising interventions appear to relate to very early physical rehabilitation. Late interventions within aftercare and recovery clinics have yielded mixed results, although experience in heart failure programs suggests the possibility that very early case management interventions may help improve intermediate-term outcomes, including mortality and hospital readmission. Predictive models have tended to underperform, complicating study design and clinical referral. The complexity of the health states associated with PICS suggests that careful and rigorous evaluation of multidisciplinary, multimodality interventions-tied to the specific conditions of interest-will be required to address these important problems.",0
22,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a Post-Intensive Care Syndrome Questionnaire (PICSQ) and assess the psychometric properties of PICSQ in intensive care unit survivors. METHODS: PICSQ items were generated through relevant literature reviews, qualitative interviews among survivors, and multiple rounds of content validity evaluations by experts. Data were collected from 536 survivors at seven health care facilities in three cities of Korea from June to August 2018. The validity and reliability of PICSQ were assessed using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and correlation coefficients. RESULTS: The final PICSQ consisted of 18 items. Through exploratory factor analysis, three factors (mental, cognitive and physical) were derived. The reliability of PICSQ was represented by a Cronbach's α of 0.93, while the internal consistency of each factor was good (Cronbach's α = 0.84 to 0.90). The model fit of PICSQ was satisfactory and confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated good convergent and discriminant validity of the questionnaire. CONCLUSION: Because PICSQ is valid and reliable, it is recommended for use in clinical practice and research to assess post-intensive care syndrome in intensive care survivors.",0
23,"BACKGROUND: Millions of patients are discharged from intensive care units annually. These intensive care survivors and their families frequently report a wide range of impairments in their health status which may last for months and years after hospital discharge. OBJECTIVES: To report on a 2-day Society of Critical Care Medicine conference aimed at improving the long-term outcomes after critical illness for patients and their families. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one invited stakeholders participated in the conference. Stakeholders represented key professional organizations and groups, predominantly from North America, which are involved in the care of intensive care survivors after hospital discharge. DESIGN: Invited experts and Society of Critical Care Medicine members presented a summary of existing data regarding the potential long-term physical, cognitive and mental health problems after intensive care and the results from studies of postintensive care unit interventions to address these problems. Stakeholders provided reactions, perspectives, concerns and strategies aimed at improving care and mitigating these long-term health problems. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three major themes emerged from the conference regarding: (1) raising awareness and education, (2) understanding and addressing barriers to practice, and (3) identifying research gaps and resources. Postintensive care syndrome was agreed upon as the recommended term to describe new or worsening problems in physical, cognitive, or mental health status arising after a critical illness and persisting beyond acute care hospitalization. The term could be applied to either a survivor or family member. CONCLUSIONS: Improving care for intensive care survivors and their families requires collaboration between practitioners and researchers in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Strategies were developed to address the major themes arising from the conference to improve outcomes for survivors and families.",0
24,"Survivors of critical illness may develop postintensive care syndrome (PICS), a spectrum of conditions that include persistent cognitive dysfunction, acquired weakness, and intrusive memories akin to post-traumatic stress disorder. Relatively few ICU survivors are routinely followed in the outpatient setting by intensivists, but are regularly evaluated by primary care physicians and physician assistants in their practices. Specific and focused education about the key features of PICS, its effect on patients as well as family members, and potential therapeutic interventions may increase recognition of PICS and reduce its effect on survivors of critical illness.",0

26,"INTRODUCTION: Due to advances in critical care medicine, more patients survive their critical illness. However, intensive care unit (ICU) survivors often experience long-term physical, cognitive and mental problems, summarised as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), impacting their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In what frequency PICS occurs, and to what extent this influences ICU survivors' HRQoL, is mostly unknown. The aims of this study are therefore to study the: (1) 5-year patient outcomes, (2) predictors for PICS, (3) ratio between HRQoL of ICU survivors and healthcare-related costs, and (4) care and support needs. METHODS: The MONITOR-IC study is a multicentre prospective controlled cohort study, carried out in ICUs in four Dutch hospitals. Patients will be included between July 2016 and July 2021 and followed for 5 years. We estimated to include 12000 ICU patients. Outcomes are the HRQoL, physical, cognitive and mental symptoms, ICU survivors' care and support needs, healthcare use and related costs. A control cohort of otherwise seriously ill patients will be assembled to compare long-term patient-reported outcomes. We will use a mixed methods design, including questionnaires, medical data from patient records, cost data from health insurance companies and interviews with patients and family members. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Insights from this study will be used to inform ICU patients and their family members about long-term consequences of ICU care, and to develop prediction and screening instruments to detect patients at risk for PICS. Subsequently, tailored interventions can be developed and implemented to prevent and mitigate long-term consequences. Additionally, insights into the ratio between HRQoL of ICU patients and related healthcare costs during 5 years after ICU admission can be used to discuss the added value of ICU care from a community perspective. The study has been approved by the research ethics committee of the Radboud University Medical Center (2016-2724). CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03246334.",0
27,"Rationale: Physical restraints are used liberally in some intensive care units (ICUs) to prevent patient harm from device removal or falls. Although the intention of restraint use is patient safety, their application may inadvertently cause physical or psychological harm. Physical restraints may contribute to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but there is a paucity of supportive data.Objectives: To investigate the association between physical restraint use and PTSD symptoms in ICU survivors. Secondary objectives were to examine the cognitive and physical outcomes associated with physical restraint use and to assess interventions that may be effective in reducing restraint use.Methods: A systematic review of English language studies in PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL between January 1, 1990, to February 8, 2020 was performed. Observational or randomized studies that reported on restraint use and associated outcomes, or interventions to reduce restraint use, in critically ill adult patients were identified. Two independent reviewers completed the review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines.Results: We identified 794 articles, of which 37 met inclusion criteria and were included. Thirty of these studies related to patient outcomes including PTSD, delirium, mechanical ventilation hours, and physical injury. Seven related to interventions to reduce physical restraint use. The quality of studies was not high; only four of the included studies were assessed to have a low risk of bias. Three studies found a significant relationship between restraint use and PTSD, but their results could not be pooled for analysis. Pooled data indicated a significant association between physical restraint use and delirium (odds ratio [OR], 11.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.66-20.01; P < 0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference in days, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.95-4.75; P < 0.001). We also found that interventions, such as nursing education, may effectively reduce restraint use by approximately 50% (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.32-0.73; P < 0.001). The impact that a reduction in restraint use may have on associated outcomes was not examined.Conclusions: Physical restraint use may be associated with PTSD in ICU survivors and is associated with delirium and longer duration of mechanical ventilation. Nurse education is likely effective in reducing rates of physical restraint among ICU patients.",0
28,"Few studies have examined the epidemiology of post-intensive care syndrome in Japan. This study investigated the mental health and quality of life of patients living at home in Japan after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Additionally, we examined whether unplanned admission to the ICU was associated with more severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depressive symptoms. An ambidirectional cohort study was conducted at 12 ICUs in Japan. Patients who stayed in the ICU for > 3 nights and were living at home for 1 year afterward were included. One year after ICU discharge, we retrospectively screened patients and performed a mail survey on a monthly basis, including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IER-S), the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), and the EuroQOL-5 Dimension (EQ-5D-L) questionnaires. Patients' characteristics, delirium and coma status, drugs used, and ICU and hospital length of stay were assessed from medical records. Descriptive statistics and multilevel linear regression modeling were used to examine our hypothesis. Among 7,030 discharged patients, 854 patients were surveyed by mail. Of these, 778 patients responded (response rate = 91.1%). The data from 754 patients were analyzed. The median IES-R score was 3 (interquartile range [IQR] = 1‒9), and the prevalence of suspected PTSD was 6.0%. The median HADS anxiety score was 4.00 (IQR = 1.17‒6.00), and the prevalence of anxiety was 16.6%. The median HADS depression score was 5 (IQR = 2‒8), and the prevalence of depression was 28.1%. EQ-5D-L scores were lower in our participants than in the sex- and age-matched Japanese population. Unplanned admission was an independent risk factor for more severe PTSD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Approximately one-third of patients in the general ICU population experienced mental health issues one year after ICU discharge. Unplanned admission was an independent predictor for more severe PTSD symptoms.",0
29,"BACKGROUND: Survivors of intensive care are known to be at increased risk of developing longer-term psychopathology issues. We present a large UK multicentre study assessing the anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) caseness in the first year following discharge from an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Design: prospective multicentre follow-up study of survivors of ICU in the UK. SETTING: patients from 26 ICUs in the UK. INCLUSION CRITERIA: patients who had received at least 24 h of level 3 ICU care and were 16 years of age or older. INTERVENTIONS: postal follow up: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Check List-Civilian (PCL-C) at 3 and 12 months following discharge from ICU. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: caseness of anxiety, depression and PTSD, 2-year survival. RESULTS: In total, 21,633 patients admitted to ICU were included in the study. Postal questionnaires were sent to 13,155 survivors; of these 38% (4943/13155) responded and 55% (2731/4943) of respondents passed thresholds for one or more condition at 3 or 12 months following discharge. Caseness prevalence was 46%, 40% and 22% for anxiety, depression and PTSD respectively; 18% (870/4943 patients) met the caseness threshold for all three psychological conditions. Patients with symptoms of depression were 47% more likely to die during the first 2 years after discharge from ICU than those without (HR 1.47, CI 1.19-1.80). CONCLUSIONS: Over half of those who respond to postal questionnaire following treatment on ICU in the UK reported significant symptoms of anxiety, depression or PTSD. When symptoms of one psychological disorder are present, there is a 65% chance they will co-occur with symptoms of one of the other two disorders. Depression following critical illness is associated with an increased mortality risk in the first 2 years following discharge from ICU. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN69112866 .

30,"Problem Post-intensive care syndrome in paediatrics (PICS-p) is a term used to describe newly acquired or worsened impairment in one or more aspects of a child's physical, psychological, cognitive, and social functioning after discharge from the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). However, consensus, conceptual insights, and assessment guidance are lacking for this syndrome. Therefore, this analysis aimed to define the concept of PICS-p to help practitioners and researchers understand the syndrome in detail using the Walker and Avant approach. Eligibility criteria We reviewed studies retrieved from several databases, namely PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Ovid, ScienceDirect, and the Springer database, using the following keywords: ‘post-intensive care syndrome’, ‘PICU’, ‘children’, ‘PICS-p’, and ‘concept analysis’. Both quantitative and qualitative studies on PICS-p were included in the search. The articles were limited to those published up to November 21, 2020. Sample Of the 762 publications selected, 24 publications met the inclusion criteria. Results PICS-p is defined on the basis of the following aspects: (1) Physical dysfunction; (2) Cognitive dysfunction; (3) Psychological dysfunction; and (4) Social dysfunction. Conclusion With the increasing success rate of PICU treatment, reduced case fatality is no longer the only outcome of critical illness in children. The long-term outcomes in children discharged from hospitals have attracted attention from families, hospitals, and communities. Implications A clear definition of PICS-p will help medical staff understand PICS-p in detail and provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome.",0
31,"BACKGROUND: As more patients are surviving intensive care, mental health concerns in survivors have become a research priority. Among these, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can have an important impact on the quality of life of critical care survivors. However, data on its burden are conflicting. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in adult critical care patients after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, PsycNET, and Scopus databases from inception to September 2018. We included observational studies assessing the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in adult critical care survivors. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Studies were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model to estimate PTSD symptom prevalence at different time points, also estimating confidence and prediction intervals. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool and the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Of 13,267 studies retrieved, 48 were included in this review. Overall prevalence of PTSD symptoms was 19.83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.72-23.13; I2 = 90%, low quality of evidence). Prevalence varied widely across studies, with a wide range of expected prevalence (from 3.70 to 43.73% in 95% of settings). Point prevalence estimates were 15.93% (95% CI, 11.15-21.35; I2 = 90%; 17 studies), 16.80% (95% CI, 13.74-20.09; I2 = 66%; 13 studies), 18.96% (95% CI, 14.28-24.12; I2 = 92%; 13 studies), and 20.21% (95% CI, 13.79-27.44; I2 = 58%; 7 studies) at 3, 6, 12, and > 12 months after discharge, respectively. CONCLUSION: PTSD symptoms may affect 1 in every 5 adult critical care survivors, with a high expected prevalence 12 months after discharge. ICU survivors should be screened for PTSD symptoms and cared for accordingly, given the potential negative impact of PTSD on quality of life. In addition, action should be taken to further explore the causal relationship between ICU stay and PTSD, as well as to propose early measures to prevent PTSD in this population.

32,"BACKGROUND: Data on intensive care unit (ICU) related psychiatric morbidity from Low Middle-Income Countries are sparse. We studied the ICU related posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), anxiety, and depression symptoms in a cohort of patients from Eastern India. METHODS: We included adults admitted more than 24 h to a mixed ICU. PTSS, anxiety, and depression symptoms were assessed by telephonic or face to face interviews by using the Impact of Events-r (IES-r) and Hospital anxiety and depression (HADS), respectively, at 0, 7,14, 30, 90 and 180 days from ICU discharge. The loss to follow up was minimal. Demographic, socioeconomic, quality of life (QOL), and critical care related variables were studied. RESULTS: Of 527 patients, 322 (59.4%) completed 6 months' follow up. The majority were male (60%), mechanically ventilated > 48 h (59.4%), mean age of 48 (+/- 16), mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) at admission 9.4 (+/- 4.6), median length of stay 3 (2-28 days). The rates of ICU related clinical PTSS was < 1 and < 3% for anxiety/depression at any point of follow up. Data were analyzed by linear mixed (random effects) models. There was a significant drop in all scores and association with repeated measures over time. Poor QOL at discharge from the ICU showed significant association with PTSS, anxiety, and depression (β = - 2.94, - 1.34, - 0.7 respectively) when corrected for gender and education levels. Younger age, greater severity of illness, and prior stressful life experiences predicted worse PTSS (β = - 0.02, 0.08, 3.82, respectively). Benzodiazepines and lower sedation scores (better alertness) predicted lower depression symptoms. (β = - 0.43, 0.37 respectively). CONCLUSION: ICU related psychiatric morbidity rates in our population are low compared with reported rates in the literature. Poor QOL at ICU discharge may predict worse long-term mental health outcomes. Further research on the impact of ICU and sociocultural factors on mental health outcomes in patients from different backgrounds is needed. The study was registered at CTRI/2017/07/008959.",0
33,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Impact Event Scale-Revisited assessed following ICU discharge to predict the emergence of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms at 3 months. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Three medical or surgical ICU of a French university hospital (Lyon, France). PATIENTS: Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old, leaving ICU after greater than or equal to 2 nights of stay, between September 2017 and April 2018. INTERVENTIONS: Patients completed the Impact Event Scale-Revisited and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire within 8 days after ICU discharge and the Impact Event Scale-Revisited again at 3 months by phone. Patients having an Impact Event Scale-Revisited greater than or equal to 35 at 3 months were considered as having post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the 208 patients screened, 174 were included and 145 reassessed by phone at 3 months. Among the patients included at baseline, 43% presented symptoms of acute stress. At 3 months, 13% had an Impact Event Scale-Revisited greater than or equal to 35 and 17% had a score between 12 and 34. Regarding the performance of the Impact Event Scale-Revisited performed within 8 days after the ICU discharge to predict post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms at 3 months, the area under the curve was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.80-0.99), and an Impact Event Scale-Revisited greater than or equal to 12 had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 71%, a positive predictive value of 32%, and a negative predictive value of 98%. History of anxiety disorder odds ratio = 3.7 (95% CI, 1.24-11.05; p = 0.02) and Impact Event Scale-Revisited greater than or equal to 12 odds ratio = 16.57 (95% CI, 3.59-76.46; p < 0.001) were identified as risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Impact Event Scale-Revisited assessed at ICU discharge has a good ability for the detection of patients at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Patients with history of anxiety disorder and those presenting acute stress symptoms at ICU discharge are more at risk to develop post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms.",0
35,"OBJECTIVES: Data show that family members of ICU patients may have high levels of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorders, and/or complicated grief. This was previously referred to as post-intensive care syndrome-family. We systematically review randomized controlled trials for post-intensive care syndrome-family. DATA SOURCES: Systematic research in databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINHAL for articles published between January 2000 and October 2019). STUDY SELECTION: Interventions in randomized controlled trials for post-intensive care syndrome-family in relatives of adult ICU patients. DATA EXTRACTION: Review, quality assessment, and risk assessment for bias of eligible publications were performed along recommended guidelines for each investigation. Quality assessment graded studies into ""strong"" (n = 5), ""moderate"" (n = 4), and ""weak"" (n = 2). DATA SYNTHESIS: Out of 2,399 publications, 11 investigations were found eligible (3,183 relatives of ICU patients). Studies addressed interventions during ICU stay (n = 6), during the post-ICU period (n = 4), or both (n = 1). Two studies included relatives of dying/deceased patients. One study implemented end-of-life conferences and showed reduced prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (45% vs 69%; p = 0.01), anxiety (45% vs 67%; p = 0.02), and depression (29% vs 56%; p = 0.003). Family conferences with a physician and proactive participation of a nurse reduced anxiety-scores (p = 0.01) without reducing anxiety prevalence (33.3% vs 52.3%; p = 0.08). Other studies failed to improve symptoms or reduce prevalence of post-intensive care syndrome-family. Interestingly, condolence letters may even increase prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (52.4% vs 37.1%; p = 0.03). Meetings without the presence of ICU physicians were shown to increase Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores (25.9 vs 21.3; p = 0.0495). CONCLUSIONS: Only few data are available on interventions for post-intensive care syndrome-family. It appears that proactive communication and provision of information seems pivotal for post-intensive care syndrome-family treatment. Interestingly, some interventions may even worsen post-intensive care syndrome-family. In the light of the relevance of post-intensive care syndrome-family in daily ICU care, more high-quality data seems urgently needed.",0
36,"Background Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are an especially susceptible population to develop post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients can suffer acute severe pain and may have long-term mental, cognitive, and functional health deterioration after discharge. However, few controlled trials are evaluating interventions for the prevention and treatment of PICS. The study hypothesis is that a specific care program based on early therapeutic education and psychological intervention improves the quality of life of patients at risk of developing PICS and chronic pain after COVID-19. The primary objective is to determine whether the program is superior to standard-of-care on health-related quality of life at 6 months after hospital discharge. The secondary objectives are to determine whether the intervention is superior to standard-of-care on health-related quality of life, incidence of chronic pain and degree of functional limitation, incidence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress syndrome at 3 and 6 months after hospital discharge. Methods The PAINCOVID trial is a unicentric randomized, controlled, patient-blinded superiority trial with two parallel groups. The primary endpoint is the health-related quality of life at 6 months after hospital discharge, and randomization will be performed with a 1:1 allocation ratio. This paper details the methodology and statistical analysis plan of the trial and was submitted before outcome data were available., The estimated sample size is 84 patients, 42 for each arm. Assuming a lost to follow-up rate of 20%, a sample size of 102 patients is necessary (51 for each arm). Discussion This is the first randomized clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of an early care therapeutic education, and psychological intervention program for the management of PICS and chronic pain after COVID-19. The intervention will serve as proof of the need to implement early care programs at an early stage, having an incalculable impact given the current scenario of the pandemic. Trial registration This study is being conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration and has been approved by the authors’ institutional review board Comité Ético de Investigación Clínica del Hospital Clínic de Barcelona (approval number: HCB/2020/0549) and was registered on May 9, 2020, at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04394169).

37,"AIM: To determine the symptoms seen in patients after discharge from an intensive care unit (ICU) and the follow-up programmes offered to help patients deal with the problems that arise after an ICU stay. BACKGROUND: An increasing number of people are discharged from an ICU to continued treatment, care and rehabilitation in general hospital wards, rehabilitation facilities and at home. A prolonged stay in an ICU is associated with stressful memories that have long-term physical, mental and social consequences for health-related quality of life. We therefore conducted a data search to identify the programmes that have attempted to cope with these consequences. DATA SOURCES: Searches of six online databases were conducted in December 2013. REVIEW METHODS: Qualitative or quantitative, original, empirical studies on symptoms and consequences associated with ICU stay and the follow-up programmes offered were reviewed. Excluded were studies in ICU patients younger than 18 years published in languages other than Scandinavian or English. We analysed original empirical studies according to symptoms, consequences and follow-up programmes and added a category 'new ideas'. This was done to identify any possible evolution in the programmes offered to patients after ICU care. The review of the literature and the critical analysis were summarized in a figure in order to join the different parts together into a logical, coherent whole. CONCLUSIONS: Patients discharged from an ICU are heterogeneous, with a wide array of physical, mental and social problems. They and their close relatives can benefit from returning together to the ICU or participating in follow-up programmes. Little is known about the specific effects of the different types of follow-up. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: ICU staff as well as other professionals should prepare patients and relatives for the fact that they may need various types of help for many months after discharge from the ICU, and an overview of national and local opportunities for help should be offered.",0
38,"BACKGROUND: Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is a combination of cognitive, psychiatric and physical impairments in survivors of critical illness and intensive care. There is little data on long-term co-occurrence of associated impairments. METHODS: Analysis of data from 289 sepsis survivors from a German multicenter RCT. Impairments associated with PICS (depression, PTSD, cognitive impairment, chronic pain, neuropathic symptoms, dysphagia) during 24 months follow-up are used to explore the frequency and risk factors of PICS components in three classification models. RESULTS: The majority of participants showed impairments in 2-3 of 6 domains during follow-up. The overall frequency of PICS according to the classification models ranged from 32.9% to 98.6%. In regression analyses, there were no significant effects in selected ICU-related exposures or covariates for PICS classification models. Regarding individual components, only higher age and longer duration of ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation showed significant positive associations with the occurrence of cognitive impairment during follow-up, as did male gender and higher age for dysphagia. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all study participants showed impairments associated with PICS in at least one domain. The proposed classification models for PICS appear to be too broad to identify specific risk factors beyond its individual components.",0
39,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the frequency of co-occurring newly acquired cognitive impairment, disability in activities of daily livings, and depression among survivors of a critical illness and to evaluate predictors of being free of post-intensive care syndrome problems. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Medical and surgical ICUs from five U.S. centers. PATIENTS: Patients with respiratory failure or shock, excluding those with preexisting cognitive impairment or disability in activities of daily livings. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At 3 and 12 months after hospital discharge, we assessed patients for cognitive impairment, disability, and depression. We categorized patients into eight groups reflecting combinations of cognitive, disability, and mental health problems. Using multivariable logistic regression, we modeled the association between age, education, frailty, durations of mechanical ventilation, delirium, and severe sepsis with the odds of being post-intensive care syndrome free. We analyzed 406 patients with a median age of 61 years and an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II of 23. At 3 and 12 months, one or more post-intensive care syndrome problems were present in 64% and 56%, respectively. Nevertheless, co-occurring post-intensive care syndrome problems (i.e., in two or more domains) were present in 25% at 3 months and 21% at 12 months. Post-intensive care syndrome problems in all three domains were present in only 6% at 3 months and 4% at 12 months. More years of education was associated with greater odds of being post-intensive care syndrome free (p < 0.001 at 3 and 12 mo). More severe frailty was associated with lower odds of being post-intensive care syndrome free (p = 0.005 at 3 mo and p = 0.048 at 12 mo). CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter cohort study, one or more post-intensive care syndrome problems were present in the majority of survivors, but co-occurring problems were present in only one out of four. Education was protective from post-intensive care syndrome problems and frailty predictive of the development of post-intensive care syndrome problems. Future studies are needed to understand better the heterogeneous subtypes of post-intensive care syndrome and to identify modifiable risk factors.",0
40,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the longterm psychological outcome in survivors of critical illness after intensive care unit discharge. METHODS: A prospective cohort of survivors admitted to a mixed intensive care unit between January and September 2010 was evaluated six months and five years after hospital discharge. The Dementia Rating Scale-2, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Posttraumatic stress syndrome 14-questions inventory, the Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5-D), and the Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) were assessed at both follow-up periods. RESULTS: Of 267 patients, 25 patients were evaluated at 6 months after discharge (62 ± 16 years); 12 (48%) presented cognitive impairment, 6 (24%) anxiety, 4 (16%) depression, and 4 (16%) post-traumatic stress disorder. Among those re-evaluated five years after discharge (n = 17; 65 ± 15 years), the frequency of cognitive impairment dropped from 8 (47%) to 3 (18%) (p = 0.063), due to improvement in these patients over time, and other patients did not acquire any dysfunction after discharge. At five years after discharge, only two patients (12%) reported anxiety, and none had depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. No differences were found between the six-month and five-year follow-ups regarding EQ-5-D and EQ VAS. CONCLUSION: Survivors do not show a progressive decline in cognitive function or quality of life within five years after intensive care unit discharge. Psychopathological symptoms tend to decrease with time.",0

42,"IMPORTANCE:          Postintensive care syndrome has a strong impact on coronavirus disease 2019 survivors.         OBJECTIVES:          Assess the 1-year prevalence of postintensive care syndrome after coronavirus disease 2019.         DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:          This was a single-center prospective cohort using questionnaires and telephone calls from 4 months to 1 year after ICU discharge. Patients who were treated for coronavirus disease 2019-related acute respiratory distress between March 19, 2020, and April 30, 2020, participated.         MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:          Postintensive care syndrome was evaluated according to physical, mental, and cognitive domains. We surveyed the 8-item standardized Short Form questionnaire for assessing physical postintensive care syndrome; the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for assessing mental postintensive care syndrome; and Short-Memory Questionnaire for assessing cognitive postintensive care syndrome. The primary outcome was postintensive care syndrome occurrence of any domain at 1 year. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of the three postintensive care syndrome domains was assessed.         RESULTS:          Eighteen patients consented to the study and completed the survey. The median age was 57.5 years, and 78% of the patients were male. Median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II score was 18. During ICU stay, 78% received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 83% received systemic steroid administration. Early mobilization was implemented in 61%. Delirium occurred in 44%. The median days of ICU and hospital stay were 6 and 23.5, respectively. Overall postintensive care syndrome occurrence was 67%. Physical, mental, and cognitive postintensive care syndrome occurred in 56%, 50%, and 33% of patients, respectively. The co-occurrence of all three domains of postintensive care syndrome was 28%. Age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II scores were higher, and systemic steroids were more commonly used in the postintensive care syndrome groups compared with the nonpostintensive care syndrome groups. Chronic symptoms were more common in the postintensive care syndrome groups than the nonpostintensive care syndrome groups.         CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:          Patients who suffered critical illness from coronavirus disease 2019 had a high frequency of postintensive care syndrome after 1 year. Long-term follow-up and care should be continuously offered.",0
43,"Delirium is an indicator of morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. It can lead to negative outcomes and longer hospital stays, thus increasing hospital costs. Despite national recommendations for daily assessment of delirium, it remains underdiagnosed. Many studies point to a lack of knowledge among health care professionals to accurately detect and manage ICU delirium. The aim of our study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Palestinian health care professionals regarding ICU delirium. The results of a cross-section observational study revealed that delirium appears to be often underrecognized or misdiagnosed in ICUs in Palestine. Therefore, it is critical to further educate the medical and nursing teams and to promote the use of validated tools that can aid in the assessment of this condition. In this way, the length of hospital stays and related health care costs can be reduced.",0
44,"OBJECTIVE: To explore nurses' experiences and perceptions of delirium, managing delirious patients, and screening for delirium, five years after introduction of the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care into standard practice. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SETTING: Twelve nurses from a medical-surgical intensive care unit in a large teaching hospital attended two focus group sessions. The collected qualitative data was thematically analysed using Braun and Clarke's framework (2006). FINDINGS: The analysis identified seven themes: (1) Delirium as a Secondary Matter (2) Unpleasant Nature of Delirium (3) Scepticism About Delirium Assessment (4) Distrust in Delirium Management (5) Value of Communication (6) Non-pharmacological Therapy (7) Need for Reviewed Delirium Policy. CONCLUSION: Nurses described perceiving delirium as a low priority matter and linked it to work culture within the intensive care specialty. Simultaneously, they expressed their readiness to challenge this culture and to promote the notion of providing high-quality delirium care. Nurses discussed their frustrations related to lack of confidence in assessing delirium, as well as lack of effective therapies in managing this group of patients. They declared their appreciation for non-pharmacological interventions in treatment of delirium, suggested improvements to current delirium approach and proposed introducing psychological support for nurses dealing with delirious patients.",0
45,"BACKGROUND: Pain, agitation-sedation and delirium management are crucial elements in the care of critically ill patients. In the present study, we aimed to present the current practice of pain, agitation-sedation and delirium assessments in Chinese intensive care units (ICUs) and investigate the gap between physicians' perception and actual clinical performance. METHODS: We sent invitations to the 33 members of the Neuro-Critical Care Committee affiliated with the Chinese Association of Critical Care Physicians. Finally, 24 ICUs (14 general-, 5 neuroscience-, 3 surgical-, and 2 emergency-ICUs) from 20 hospitals participated in this one-day point prevalence study combined with an on-site questionnaire survey. We enrolled adult ICU admitted patients with a length of stay ≥24 h, who were divided into the brain-injured group or non-brain-injured group. The hospital records and nursing records during the 24-h period prior to enrollment were reviewed. Actual evaluations of pain, agitation-sedation and delirium were documented. We invited physicians on-duty during the 24 h prior to the patients' enrollment to complete a survey questionnaire, which contained attitude for importance of pain, agitation-sedation and delirium assessments. RESULTS: We enrolled 387 patients including 261 (67.4%) brain-injured and 126 (32.6%) non-brain-injured patients. There were 19.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.9-23.9%) and 25.6% (95% CI: 21.2-29.9%) patients receiving the pain and agitation-sedation scale assessment, respectively. The rates of these two types of assessments were significantly lower in brain-injured patients than non-brain-injured patients (p = 0.003 and < 0.001). Delirium assessment was only performed in three patients (0.8, 95% CI: 0.1-1.7%). In questionnaires collected from 91 physicians, 70.3% (95% CI: 60.8-79.9%) and 82.4% (95% CI: 74.4-90.4%) reported routine use of pain and agitation-sedation scale assessments, respectively. More than half of the physicians (52.7, 95% CI: 42.3-63.2%) reported daily screening for delirium using an assessment scale. CONCLUSIONS: The actual prevalence of pain, agitation-sedation and delirium assessment, especially delirium screening, was suboptimal in Chinese ICUs. There is a gap between physicians' perceptions and actual clinical practice in pain, agitation-sedation and delirium assessments. Our results will prompt further quality improvement projects to optimize the practice of pain, agitation-sedation and delirium management in China.

46,"The number of delirium days in hospitalized patients directly correlates with mortality and long-term cognitive dysfunction. Burn patients are at greater risk for delirium due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, high sedative and analgesic medication requirements, and the common need for multiple operations. Limited research exists on nurses' understanding and comfort using delirium screening tools and preventive interventions. A process improvement project was developed in a single, regional burn intensive care unit (BICU) with the goal of increasing RN staff awareness of delirium, delirium assessment, and preventive interventions. A 10-question survey was developed and administered to the BICU RN staff before and after the educational intervention. Both quantitative and qualitative data analyses were performed. Twenty-seven (38%) anonymous surveys were returned. In pre- and postintervention surveys, respondents agreed that nursing interventions were important in preventing delirium. Despite educational intervention, 26% of the respondents reported that a tool is not needed to identify delirium. Survey analysis indicated strong support for nonpharmacologic nursing interventions in preventing delirium as well as reducing pharmacologic interventions, especially benzodiazepines. Mechanical ventilation was perceived as a barrier to performing the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) in both pre- and postsurveys. Staff compliance with documenting CAM-ICU assessments increased and CAM-positive days decreased over the project timeline. Overall, BICU nurses' awareness and general knowledge about delirium increased and specific knowledge deficits were discovered. Continued education about the CAM-ICU tool is still needed; additionally addressing barriers within the structure of the unit to provide nurses more resources to properly assess and prevent delirium.",0
47,"Objective: To investigate doctors' and nurses' perceptions and implementation of delirium management in intensive care unit. Methods: A total of 197 doctors and nurses in 2 general ICUs and 3 special ICUs at Peking Union Medical College Hospital finished a self-designed questionnaire of delirium management. Results: There were 47 males and 150 females, 43 doctors and 154 nurses who participated in the survey.One hundred and twenty five participators were from general ICU and the others from special ICU. The ICU staff had a significant difference on the perceptions and implementation of delirium management(P< 0.001) including. Doctors and nurses scored lowest in ""family engagement and empowerment"" and ""sleep management"" with (4.620±2.393) and (5.430±2.153) respectively. There was a significant difference between nurses and doctors in the management of analgesia and sedation (P< 0.05).Doctors and nurses from different ICUs had significant discrepancy in the implementation of ""delirium assessment"" (P< 0.05). Conclusions: The ICU staff should improve the perceptions and the implementation of delirium management,especially in special ICUs. Delirium management should be included as a routine care in ICU to improve patients' outcome.",0
48,"PURPOSE: To review the available literature regarding delirium experiences of family caregivers and healthcare staff, to discuss how caregivers and staff perception can increase delirium detection and to summarize how to address the needs of family caregivers and healthcare providers in delirium care. METHODS: ""State of the science"" paper. RESULTS: High levels of caregiver stress are associated with delirium, although sources and features of burden differ according to background health status of patients, i.e. older subjects, with or without dementia, or terminal neoplastic disease. Family observation of cognitive changes is key for delirium detection, especially when dementia coexists, and is included in available delirium detection instruments. Healthcare staff experiences a high level of burden associated with delirium care, but often does not recognize delirium according to literature. An interprofessional healthcare staff education can improve attitudes towards delirium and increase delirium awareness, although intervention studies are still limited. Flexible visiting time is important to reduce family burden, although it needs appropriate staff training and work organization to avoid the risk of increased nurse burn-out. CONCLUSION: Delirium is a stressful event not only for patients but also for family caregivers and healthcare staff, especially nurses. Recording the observations of family members and healthcare staff can help in delirium detection. Staff education is crucial to reduce the burden of professional and family caregivers.",0
49,"AIMS: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-summary was the aggregation of the empirical qualitative literature on patients' experiences of delirium in order to support the development and implementation of patient-oriented delirium management and to guide future research. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic literature review of qualitative research published between January 1980 and June 2019. DATA SOURCES: In June 2019, we searched in Medline, CINAHL, SSCI and PsycInfo to identify relevant reports. In addition, we conducted searches in three dissertation databases (BASE, DART and ProQuest) and Google Scholar. REVIEW METHODS: We used methods developed by Sandelowski and Barroso to construct a meta-summary of the findings by extracting them from the reports, abstracting them into meta- findings and calculating their manifest interstudy frequency effect sizes. RESULTS: Out of the 742 identified records, 24 reports based on delirium experience accounts of 483 patients met our criteria and were included. One thousand ninety-seven findings were extracted from these reports and abstracted into 92 meta-findings. These were grouped to the five emerging themes 'perception', 'emotions', 'interaction with others', 'dealing with delirium' and 'influence on further life'. CONCLUSION: Delirium is commonly perceived as an overall distressing condition, which can accompany and influence patients even after hospital discharge. IMPACT: This systematic review and meta-summary is the most comprehensive aggregation of qualitative research of the patient delirium experience to date. It allows us to better understand, extract meaning from, and weigh the qualitative findings in their context by calculating their manifest frequency effect sizes. This can be used to support the development and implementation of delirium management concepts.",0
50,"BACKGROUND: Better understanding of patient and family member experiences of delirium and related distress during critical care is required to inform the development of targeted nonpharmacologic interventions. OBJECTIVE: To examine and synthesize qualitative data on patient and family member delirium experiences and relieving factors in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis. Eligible studies contained adult patient or family quotes about delirium during critical care, published in English in a peer-reviewed journal since 1980. Data sources included PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane and Clinicaltrials.gov. METHODS: Systematic searches yielded 3238 identified articles, of which 14 reporting 13 studies were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Qualitative meta-synthesis was performed through line-by-line coding of relevant quotes, organization of codes into descriptive themes, and development of analytical themes. Five patients/family members with experience of ICU delirium contributed to the thematic analysis. RESULTS: Qualitative meta-synthesis resulted in four major themes and two sub-themes. Key new patient and family-centric insights regarding delirium-related distress in the ICU included articulation of the distinct emotions experienced during and after delirium (for patients, predominantly fear, anger and shame); its 'whole-person' nature; and the value that patients and family members placed on clinicians' compassion, communication, and connectedness. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct difficult emotions and other forms of distress are experienced by patients and families during ICU delirium, during which patients and families highly value human kindness and empathy. Future studies should further explore and address the many facets of delirium-related distress during critical care using these insights and include patient-reported measures of the predominant difficult emotions.",0

53,"OBJECTIVE: Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which encompasses profound psychological morbidity, affects many survivors of critical illness. We hypothesize that acute psychological stress during the intensive care unit (ICU) confinement likely contributes to PICS. In order to develop strategies that mitigate PICS associated psychological morbidity, it is paramount to first characterize acute ICU psychological stress and begin to understand its causative and protective factors. METHODS: A structured interview study was administered to adult critical illness survivors who received ≥48h of mechanical ventilation in medical and surgical ICUs of a tertiary care center, and their families. RESULTS: Fifty patients and 44 family members were interviewed following ICU discharge. Patients reported a high level of psychological distress. The families' perception of patient's stress level correlated with the patient's self-estimated stress level both in daily life (rho=0.59; p<0.0001) and in ICU (rho=0.45; p=0.002). 70% of patients experienced fear of death, 38% had additional other fears, 48% had hallucinations. Concerns included inability to communicate (34%), environmental factors (30%), procedures and restraints (24%), and being intubated (12%). Emotional support of family/friend/staff/clergy (86%), and physical therapy/walking (14%) were perceived to be important mitigating factors. Clinicians' actions that were perceived to be very constructive included reassurance (54%), explanations (32%) and physical touch (8%). CONCLUSIONS: Fear, hallucinations, and the inability to communicate, are identified as central contributors to psychological stress during an ICU stay; the presence of family, and physician's attention are categorized as important mitigating factors. Patients and families identified several practical recommendations which may help assuage the psychological burden of the ICU stay.",0

55,"Background and Objectives While there are qualitative studies examining the delirium-related experiences of patients, family caregivers, and nurses separately, little is known about common aspects of delirium burden among all three groups. We describe common delirium burdens from the perspectives of patients, family caregivers, and nurses. Research Design and Methods We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews about delirium burden with 18 patients who had recently experienced a delirium episode, with 16 family caregivers, and with 15 nurses who routinely cared for patients with delirium. We recruited participants from a large, urban teaching hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. We used interpretive description as the approach to data analysis. Results We identified three common burden themes of the delirium experience: Symptom Burden (Disorientation, Hallucinations/Delusions, Impaired Communication, Memory Problems, Personality Changes, Sleep Disturbances); Emotional Burden (Anger/Frustration, Emotional Distress, Fear, Guilt, Helplessness); and Situational Burden (Loss of Control, Lack of Attention, Lack of Knowledge, Lack of Resources, Safety Concerns, Unpredictability, Unpreparedness). These burdens arise from different sources among patients, family caregivers, and nurses, with markedly differing perspectives on the burden experience. Discussion and Implications Our findings advance the understanding of common burdens of the delirium experience for all groups and offer structure for instrument development and distinct interventions to address the burden of delirium as an individual or group experience. Our work reinforces that no one group experiences delirium in isolation. Delirium is a shared experience that will respond best to systemwide approaches to reduce associated burden.",0
56,"Delirium is an acute deterioration in attention, conscious state, perception, and cognition of a person. While nurses possess the theoretical understanding of the condition, they lack insight into its early recognition and management. This systematic review aims to understand what factors influence nurses as they care for patients with delirium, and to identify best practices to improve overall clinical care. The Qualitative Evidence Synthesis (QES), as a strategy process to identify gaps in research, formulate new models or strategies for care, underpinned the review. In addition to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, a methodological assessment, data were analysed using QES, as informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute Review process. Ten studies were identified and synthesised to generate four key themes. The themes included (1) nurse's knowledge deficit; (2) increased workload and stress; (3) safety concerns among nurse when caring for patients with delirium; and (4) strategies used when caring for patients with delirium. Overall, the review has highlighted the need for increased delirium education and coping strategies among nurses to effectively care for patients with delirium. This may be augmented through regular education sessions to provide nurses with the confidence and competence to care for the acutely confused person.",0
57,"BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops after a person has experienced a traumatic event which can be highly accounted for amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of PTSD among the severe cases of COVID-19. METHODS: We included the observational studies done to estimate the burden of PTSD among severe COVID-19 patients. Data was extracted manually using structured data extraction form and analyzed in STATA version 14.2. A random-effects model was applied, and the final pooled data was reported as proportion with a 95% confidence interval. Multivariable meta-regression analysis was carried out, and a forest plot was utilized to represent the study-specific and pooled estimates for overall and subgroup analysis. RESULTS: We included 13 articles with 1,093 participants in our analysis. The pooled prevalence was estimated to be 16% (95%CI: 9% to 23%). We found a substantial heterogeneity between the studies that reported the outcome (I2=87.9%, p<0.001). In subgroup analysis, the difference in prevalence estimate between the regions was statistically significant. LIMITATIONS: We found significant between-study variability for the outcome. In addition, our review was found to have substantial publication bias. We also found that the lower quality of the majority of the studies being included in our review. INTERPRETATION: Our study states that the risk of PTSD is higher following severe COVID-19 infection. Understanding this burden will help us in diverting the resources and adapting necessary interventions to control the situation.",0
58,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common clinical syndrome with significant associated mortality, morbidity and financial cost. Less is understood about the experience of delirium for the patient, their family and staff involved in their care. OBJECTIVE: This synthesis draws on qualitative and quantitative literature examining different populations (patients, relatives and staff) in different clinical settings (intensive care units, surgery and hospice care) to provide a clinical summary of the delirium experience from the perspective of patients, relatives and staff. DESIGN: A literature search was conducted in Ovid, MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, British Nursing Index and Archive and PubMed between 1980 and 2011 using the terms 'delirium' combined with 'distress', 'recall', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'PTSD', 'experience' and 'patient education'. Articles were restricted to English language only. RESULTS: Evidence suggests that some patients recall delirium and that recollections are generally distressing. Distress may be greater in relatives witnessing delirium and is also reported in professional staff. This distress may result in longer-term psychological sequelae. Remedial action, such as explanatory information to patients and their families, may reduce distress and psychological morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of the experience and psychological consequences of delirium will inform the development of appropriate methods of providing support and information to those at risk of delirium and their families or carers.",0
59,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to interpretatively synthesise qualitative findings on patients' lived experience of delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to identify meanings and potential existential issues that affect them during and after their experience. Patients may face existential challenges when they are vulnerable in their confusion, all while confronting the reality of their mortality in the critically ill state. REVIEW METHODS: The study involved meta-ethnographic synthesis of published qualitative studies addressing the lived experience of delirium for patients in ICU based on a systematic literature search. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, ProQuest, and Cochrane were the sources. Studies were selected based on the predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The identified studies were subjected to a quality appraisal based on a Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. RESULTS: Based on the eligibility criteria, nine qualitative studies were included, of overall medium to high quality. One core theme, ""a perturbing altered reality"" and four main themes were identified: ""disturbed sense of time"", ""omnipresent feeling of fear"", ""impact of human connection"", and ""perceiving surreal events"". These four themes illustrate how the three salient existential issues of uncertainty, self-perceived helplessness, and death that are present in delirium make it a highly distressing experience for patients in ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill patients who experience delirium appear to face intense existential issues, which may not be identified by care providers and may remain unaddressed during their ICU stay and after discharge. Patients report that addressing the memories of these issues would be therapeutic. Future research needs to explore care approaches to meet the unique psychosocial needs of critically ill patients with delirium.",0
60,"Purpose of the study The study objective was to understand providers' perceptions regarding identifying and treating older adults with delirium, a common complication of acute illness in persons with dementia, in the pre-hospital and emergency department environments. Design and methods The authors conducted structured focus group interviews with separate groups of emergency medical services staff, emergency nurses, and emergency physicians. Recordings of each session were transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes with representative supporting quotations identified. Results Providers shared that the busy emergency department environment was the largest challenge to delirium recognition and treatment. When describing delirium, participants frequently detailed hyperactive features of delirium, rather than hypoactive features. Participants shared that they employed no clear diagnostic strategy for identifying the condition and that they used heterogeneous approaches to treat the condition. To improve care for older adults with delirium, emergency nurses identified the need for more training around the management of the condition. Emergency medical services providers identified the need for more support in managing agitated patients when in transport to the hospital and more guidance from emergency physicians on what information to collect from the patient's home environment. Emergency physicians felt that delirium care would be improved if they could have baseline mental status data on their patients and if they had access to a simple, accurate diagnostic tool for the condition. Implications Emergency medical services providers, emergency nurses, and emergency physicians frequently encounter delirious patients, but do not employ clear diagnostic strategies for identifying the condition and have varying levels of comfort in managing the condition. Clear steps should be taken to improve delirium care in the emergency department including the development of mechanisms to communicate patients' baseline mental status, the adoption of a systematized approach to recognizing delirium, and the institution of a standardized method to treat the condition when identified.",0
61,"Delirium has the highest occurrence rate of any complication in hospitalized adults over the age of 65. The study objective was to determine physician information needs for use in the development of electronic clinical decision support for physicians managing the care of patients with delirium.

Thematic analysis revealed the following 6 themes: 1) Clinician's experience an impoverished information field for mental status, 2) Uncertainty is pervasive, 3) Extensive information foraging effort is required for cohesive story building, 4) Goal Conflict leads to missed diagnosis and early closure, 5) Diffusion of Responsibility for treating delirium is common, and 6) Use of structured delirium resources is minimal. Elicited information needs were identified and physician recommendations for improving access to information needed in managing the care of patient's with delirium are reported. Information elicited in this study is useful for designing delirium clinical decision support that supports physician cognition.",0
62,"BACKGROUND: Delirium occurs in up to 80% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit. Nonpharmacologic delirium-prevention strategies, which are commonly used by the bedside nurse, have reduced the incidence and duration of delirium in patients in the intensive care unit. With increasing demands on the nurse, strategies such as including the patient's family in delirium prevention activities should be investigated. OBJECTIVE To determine opinions and willingness of health care providers to involve patients' families in nonpharmacologic delirium-prevention activities in the intensive care unit, and of patients' families to be involved. METHODS: Two surveys, one for intensive care unit nurses and physicians and one for patients' families, were developed and administered. The provider survey focused on current delirium-prevention practices and opinions about family involvement. The family survey concentrated on barriers and willingness to participate in prevention activities. RESULTS: Sixty nurses and 58 physicians completed the survey. Most physicians (93%) and all nurses believed families could assist with delirium prevention. Only 50% reported speaking with family members about delirium and delirium prevention. The family survey was completed by 60 family members; 38% reported a provider spoke with them about delirium. Family members reported high levels of comfort in participating in delirium-prevention activities. CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers and family members are supportive of the latter performing delirium-prevention activities. Family of patients in the intensive care unit may work collaboratively with nurses to reduce the incidence and duration of delirium in these patients.",0
63,"Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness, cognition and perception that occurs frequently in medically ill patients. Although it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, it is often not recognized and treated by physicians. Literature searches were conducted using MEDLINE with the following keywords/ phrases: delirium, acute confusion and management. Additional articles identified by hand-searching in major journals of medicine and psychiatry, and a review of references cited within these sources supplemented the search. In this article, the available published literature regarding the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of delirium is systematically reviewed. Prevention and treatment strategies do not need to be complex or expensive but require well-coordinated interventions from multiple disciplines, including nursing, psychiatry, neurology and primary care, as well as the cooperation and significant effort of family and friends. Atypical antipsychotic agents offer some advantages over haloperidol and in a limited number of studies appear safe and effective for delirium.",0
64,"Older people with delirium occupy more than one third of acute medical beds and require increased medical attention, as care at present is suboptimal. In addition, since delirium is undetected, it should form a target for teaching in wards. Moreover, as people with delirium are largely dependent on daily interactions and care by inpatients professional staff, it is important to address stigmatisation of these vulnerable patients. This is especially important as previous studies have shown that negative staff attitudes towards these patients undermine good care. This single center cross-sectional study was designed to determine the extent of institutional stigma among health professionals involved in the care of people with delirium. For this, professional staff working on medical wards and in communities were approached to fill in a questionnaire containing the adapted Delirium Stigma Scale and the EuroQol five dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. Additional demographic information concerning their education and professional and personal experience with delirium was also collected. The characteristics associated with stigma were determined from the sample. The findings of our study provide an insight into the high level of stigmatisation of delirium patients among professionals (mean 11.66/18 points). This was not related to professionals' own experiences of delirium, their educational and professional backgrounds, or them having received formal delirium education. However, working closely with people with delirium seems to have a positive impact on the de-stigmatisation of this population among health professionals. Our findings that attitudes are not influenced by formal delirium teaching need to be incorporated into the design of interprofessional educational interventions. Accordingly, we advocate more direct patient-oriented and care delivered teaching interventions.",0
65,"The purpose of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and managements regarding delirium of intensive care nurses and physicans, and to assess the perceived barriers related to intensive care unit (ICU) delirium monitoring in China. A descriptive survey was distributed to 1156 critical care nurses and physicians from 74 tertiary and secondary hospitals across Shandong province, China. The overall response rate was 86.18% (n = 917). The majority of respondents (88%) believed that deirium was associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, and 79.72% thought delirium was associated with prolonged length of hospitalization. Only 14.17% of respondents believed that delirium was common in the ICU setting. Only 25.62% of the respondents reported routine screening of ICU delirium, and only 15.81% utilized Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit screening tools. ""Lack of appropriate screening tools"" and ""time restraints"" were the most common perceived barriers. 45.4% of the participants had never received any education on ICU delirium. In conclusion, most nurses and physicians consider ICU delirium to be a serious problem, but lack knowledge on delirium and monitor this condition poorly. The survey infers a disconnection between the perceived significance and current monitoring of ICU delirium. There is a critical unmet need for in-service education on ICU delirium for physicians and nurses in China.",0
66,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a serious complication in patients in intensive care units. Previous surveys on delirium management in daily practice showed low adherence to published guidelines. AIM: To evaluate delirium management in nurses and physicians working in intensive care units in German-speaking countries and to identify related differences between nurses and physicians. DESIGN: The study used an open online survey with multiple-choice responses. METHODS: An invitation for participation was spread via journals and electronic resources using a snowball system. Apart from recording socio-demographical characteristics, the survey collected data on delirium assessment, delirium-related processes, non-pharmacological prevention and treatment and barriers for implementation. Differences between nurses and physicians were tested by Fisher's exact test with sequential Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: The survey was conducted in autumn 2016, and 559 clinicians participated. More nurses than physicians reported screening for delirium. The majority of clinicians reported screening for delirium when this was suspected; more than 50% used validated instruments. Half of the clinicians had delirium-related structures implemented, such as two thirds reporting delirium-related processes. Most cited barriers were lack of time and missing knowledge about delirium and its assessment. With significant difference, physicians recommended more than nurses early removal of catheters and daily interprofessional goals for patients. CONCLUSION: In German-speaking countries, assessment of delirium needs further improvement, leading to accurate assessment. Delirium-related structures and processes appear to be implemented widely, with only a few differences between nurses and physicians. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses and physicians in this survey reported similar perceptions and attitudes towards management of delirium. Both professions need more knowledge and inter-professional training on when and how to use validated assessment instruments.",0
67,"BACKGROUND: Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) has received more attention in the past decade. Early detection, prevention and treatment of delirium are important, and the most commonly used tool for delirium assessment is the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). AIM: The aim of this study was to identify nurses' and physicians' perceived professional barriers to using the CAM-ICU in Danish ICUs. METHODS: This study uses a qualitative explorative multicentre design using focus groups and a semi-structured interview guide. Five focus groups with nurses (n = 20) and four with physicians (n = 14) were conducted. Strategic sampling was used to include participants with varying CAM-ICU experience at units, with variable implementation of the tool. RESULTS: Using a hermeneutical approach, three main themes and nine sub-themes emerged. The main themes were (1) Professional role issues: CAM-ICU screening affected nursing care, clinical judgment and professional integrity; (2) Instrument reliability: nurses and physicians expressed concerns about CAM-ICU assessment in non-sedated patients, patients with multi-organ failure or patients influenced by residual sedatives/opioids; and (3) Clinical consequence: after CAM-ICU assessment, physicians lacked evidence-based treatment options, and nurses lacked physician acknowledgment and guidelines for disclosing CAM-ICU results to patients. CONCLUSION: In this study, ICU nurses and physicians raised a number of concerns regarding the use of the CAM-ICU for delirium detection. It might be necessary to revalidate the instrument as ICU care has changed in recent years, with lighter sedation and early mobilization of patients. We recommend that nurses and physicians receive more training in the use of the CAM-ICU to address some of the issues identified in our study. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: There is a need for ongoing training and clearer guidelines on how to proceed with the delirium screening of non-sedated patients.",0
68,"BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, nurses use their clinical gaze and make observations in order to assess patients' medical conditions and care needs. However, signs of developing intensive care unit delirium (ICUD) are often difficult to determine, as communication with patients is usually limited because of intubation and the seriousness of their medical condition(s). Usually, ICUD is screened and diagnosed with different, mainly nonverbal instruments, which presupposes that the observer is skilled and experienced in recognizing symptoms and signs of delirium. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to investigate if there was a concordance between data from continuous clinical observations described in the researcher's logbook and patients' statements of their experiences of delirium during their ICU stay. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were that the patients had been mechanically ventilated and had stayed in the ICU for a minimum of 36 hours. From this, a multiple-case design (n = 19), based on 1 to 3 hours of observations in the ICU and 2 interviews, was used. The first interview was conducted at the hospital approximately 6 to 14 days after discharge from the ICU, and the second, 4 to 8 weeks following the first interview in patients' homes. Two typical cases were identified and described by a cross-case procedure. RESULTS: A concordance between observations and patients' statements was found. Subtle, as well as obvious, signs of delirium were possible to detect by attentive observations over time and listening to what patients were trying to convey with their speech and body language. Experiencing delirium seemed to indicate existential suffering where the abnormal became the normal and not being able to distinguish between reality and fantasies. CONCLUSION: A continuity of skilled observations and listening to patients' statements are vital for detection of ongoing ICU delirium or experiences of delirium.",0
69,"Delirium describes a sudden onset change in mental status of fluctuating course. This is a state of altered consciousness characterised chiefly by inattention or lack of arousal, but can also include new impairment of language, perception and behaviour. Certain predisposing factors can make an individual more susceptible to delirium in the face of a stressor. Stressors include direct insults to the brain, insults peripheral to the brain or external changes in the environment of an individual. Delirium is varied in its presentation, and can be categorised by the psychomotor profile as: hyperactive type (overly vigilant, agitated, often wandersome), hypoactive type (sedate or withdrawn) or mixed types.",0
70,"OBJECTIVES: ABCDEF bundle implementation in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is associated with dose dependent improvements in patient outcomes. The objective was to compare nurse attitudes about the ABCDEF bundle to self-reported adherence to bundle components. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY/DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nurses providing direct patient care in 28 ICUs within 18 hospitals across the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 53-item survey of attitudes and practice of the ABCDEF bundle components was administered between November 2011 and August 2015 (n = 1661). RESULTS: We did not find clinically significant correlations between nurse attitudes and adherence to Awakening trials, Breathing trials, and sedation protocol adherence (rs = 0.05-0.28) or sedation plan discussion during rounds and Awakening and Breathing trial Coordination (rs = 0.19). Delirium is more likely to be discussed during rounds when ICU physicians and nurse managers facilitate delirium reduction (rs = 0.27-0.36). Early mobilization is more likely to occur when ICU physicians, nurse managers, staffing, equipment, and the ICU environment facilitate early mobility (rs = 0.36-0.47). Physician leadership had the strongest correlation with reporting an ICU environment that facilitates ABCDEF bundle implementation (rs = 0.63-0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Nurse attitudes about bundle implementation did not predict bundle adherence. Nurse manager and physician leadership played a large role in creating a supportive ICU environment.",0
71,"BACKGROUND: Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is common, but reliable evidence-based recommendations are still limited. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to explore nurses' and physicians' experiences and approaches to ICU delirium management. METHOD: Our study had a qualitative multicentre design using interdisciplinary focus groups and framework analysis. Participants were strategically selected to include nurses and physicians with experience in delirium management at five ICUs in four out of five regions in Denmark. RESULTS: We conducted eight focus group interviews with 24 nurses and 15 physicians; median ICU experience was 9 years (range 1-35). The main issues identified were (1) the decision to treat or not to treat ICU delirium based on delirium phenotype, (2) the decision to act based on experience or evidence, and (3) the decision to intervene using nursing care or medications. ICU delirium was treated with pharmacological interventions in patients with signs of agitation, hallucinations, and sleep deprivation. The first choice of agent was haloperidol or olanzapine. Agitated and combative patients received benzodiazepines, propofol, or dexmedetomidine. Calm delirious patients were managed with non-pharmacological solutions. Physicians recommended pro re nata (PRN) orders to prevent over medication, whereas nurses opposed PRN orders with the fear that it would increase their responsibilities. CONCLUSION: Our study described an algorithm of contemporary delirium management in Danish ICUs based on qualitative inquiry. When evidence-based solutions are unclear, nurses and physicians rely on personal experience, collective experience, and best available evidence to determine which patients to treat and what methods to use to treat ICU delirium. Delirium management still needs clear objectives and guidelines with evidence-based recommendations for first-line treatment and subsequent treatment options.",0
72,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common form of vital organ dysfunction in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and is associated with poor outcomes. Adherence to guideline recommendations pertaining to delirium is still suboptimal. AIMS: We performed a survey aimed at identifying barriers for implementation that should be addressed in a tailored implementation intervention targeted at improved ICU delirium guideline adherence. DESIGN: The survey was conducted among ICU professionals. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among 360 ICU health care professionals (nurses, physicians and delirium consultants) from six ICUs in the southwest of the Netherlands as part of a multicentre prospective implementation project [response rate: 64% of 565 invited; 283 (79%) were nurses]. RESULTS: Although the majority (83%) of respondents considered delirium a common and major problem in the ICU, we identified several barriers for implementation of a delirium guideline. The most important barriers were knowledge deficit, low delirium screening rate, lack of trust in the reliability of delirium screening tools, belief that delirium is not preventable, low familiarity with delirium guidelines, low satisfaction with physician-described delirium management, poor collaboration between nurses and physicians, reluctance to change delirium care practices, lack of time, disbelief that patients would receive optimal care when adhering to the guideline and the perception that the delirium guideline is cumbersome or inconvenient in daily practice. CONCLUSION: Although ICU professionals consider delirium a serious problem, several important barriers to adhere to guidelines on delirium management are still present today. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Identification of implementation barriers for adherence to guidelines pertaining to delirium is feasible with a survey. Results of this study may help to design-targeted implementation strategies for ICU delirium management.",0
73,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of doctors and nurses caring for patients with delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to describe the process of delirium management. SETTING: This study was performed in 5 ICUs located within 4 hospitals in Madrid (Spain). PARTICIPANTS: Purposeful sampling was performed which included (1) doctors and nurses working in ICUs, (2) with >1 year experience in the ICU and (3) clinical experience with delirium. 38 professionals participated (19 doctors, 19 nurses), including 22 women and 16 men. The total mean age was 39 years. DESIGN: A qualitative study using focus groups. METHODS: 7 focus groups were held to collect data: 3 nurse focus groups, 3 doctor focus groups and 1 mixed focus group. Each group comprised 6-10 participants. A semistructured questions guide was used. Thematic analysis methods were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: 3 themes were identified: (1) the professional perspective on delirium; (2) implementing pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment for delirium and (3) work organisation in the ICU. The professionals regarded patients with delirium with uncertainty, and felt they were often underdiagnosed and poorly managed. Doctors displayed discrepancies regarding pharmacological prescriptions and decision-making. The choice of medication was determined by experience. Nurses felt that, for many doctors, delirium was not considered a matter of urgency in the ICU. Nurses encountered difficulties when applying verbal restraint, managing sleep disorders and providing early mobilisation. The lack of a delirium protocol generates conflicts regarding what type of care management to apply, especially during the night shift. A degree of group pressure exists which, in turn, influences the decision-making process and patient care. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with delirium represent complex cases, requiring the implementation of specific protocols. These results serve to improve the process of care in patients with delirium.",0
75,"BACKGROUND: delirium is under-diagnosed and under-treated in comparison to other common and serious acute disorders. The reasons for this are unclear. OBJECTIVE: we conducted a multicentre survey of knowledge of and attitudes to delirium in trainee general physicians. DESIGN: questionnaire-based survey in 34 acute hospitals in the UK. METHODS: we developed a questionnaire designed to test knowledge of delirium prevalence, DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, use of specific screening tools, association with adverse outcomes, and pharmacological management. Questionnaires were completed and returned by hand to the researchers immediately after recruitment. Participants were a convenience sample of trainee doctors in general and emergency medicine. RESULTS: 784 trainee physicians participated. Most participants expressed the view that delirium has a high prevalence and that it is associated with serious adverse outcomes. However, they had poor knowledge of its diagnosis and treatment, reporting the need for better training. Experience working in geriatric medicine had only a modest effect on the ability to diagnose delirium. CONCLUSIONS: UK training doctors' lack of basic knowledge of the diagnosis and management of delirium, rather than a lack of awareness of its high prevalence and clinical significance, appears to be important in determining its under-recognition.",0
76,"OBJECTIVES: This research aims to describe the intensive care patients' perception of a delirium. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: A hermeneutic qualitative research was designed using semi-structured interviews. Adult patients admitted between December 2011 and April 2012 to the intensive care unit of a Belgian public hospital, scoring positive for delirium at least once, were eligible for this study. At least 48hours after the last positive score for delirium, the patients could be interviewed. Data saturation was achieved after 30 patients. RESULTS: Several patients spontaneously indicated the recollection of the delirium, whereas others needed a few questions or needed the specificity of the syndrome to be pointed out. The analysis of the qualitative data resulted in four major themes: (1) contact and communication, (2) feelings, (3) sleep and time and (4) implication of the delirious episode. CONCLUSION: Interviewees recollected a vivid delirium with unrealistic scenes. The study delivered a first understanding of patients' perceptions during a delirium. This qualitative research tried to image the patients' perceptions providing nurses, physicians, other health-care workers as well as patients and their family with a better insight into the syndrome. Targeted interventions may be developed to relieve the burden of the syndrome.",0
77,"OBJECTIVE: Recently published clinical practice guidelines of the Society of Critical Care Medicine recommend monitoring for the presence of delirium in all mechanically ventilated patients because of the potential for adverse outcomes associated with this comorbidity, yet little is known about healthcare professionals' opinions regarding intensive care unit delirium or how they manage this organ dysfunction. The aim of this survey was to assess the medical community's beliefs and practices regarding delirium in the intensive care unit. DESIGN: Survey administration was conducted both without a delirium definition (phase 1) and then with a definition of delirium (phase 2). SETTING: Critical care meetings and continuing medical education/board review courses from October 2001 to July 2002. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of physicians (n = 753), nurses (n = 113), pharmacists (n = 13), physician assistants (n = 12), respiratory care practitioners (n = 8), and others (n = 13). INTERVENTIONS: Survey. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Participants completed 912 of the surveys. The majority (68%) of respondents thought that >25% of adult mechanically ventilated patients experience delirium. Delirium was considered a significant or very serious problem in the intensive care unit by 92% of healthcare professionals, yet underdiagnosis was acknowledged by 78%. Only 40% reported routinely screening for delirium, and only 16% indicated using a specific tool for delirium assessment. Delirium was considered important in the outcome of elderly and young patients by 89% and 60% of the respondents, respectively (p <.0001). The most serious complications these professionals associated with delirium were prolonged mechanical ventilation, self-injury, and respiratory difficulties. Delirium was treated with haloperidol by 66% of the respondents, with lorazepam by 12%, and with atypical antipsychotics by <5%. More than 55% administered haloperidol and lorazepam at daily doses of < or =10 mg, but some used >50 mg/day of either medication. CONCLUSIONS: Most healthcare professionals consider delirium in the intensive care unit a common and serious problem, although few actually monitor for this condition and most admit that it is underdiagnosed. Data from this survey point to a disconnect between the perceived significance of delirium in the intensive care unit and current practices of monitoring and treatment.",0
78,"AIM: To describe the facilitators and barriers perceived by healthcare teams after the implementation of the Awakening, Breathing, Coordination, Delirium monitoring/management and Early mobility bundle in an intensive care unit in Italy. This multicomponent intervention strategy has been associated with lower probabilities of delirium, improved functional outcomes and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation. METHODS: A survey study conducted between June 2015 and May 2016 explored variables related to intensive care unit team members: perceptions of delirium; knowledge of the Awakening, Breathing, Coordination, Delirium monitoring/management and Early mobility bundle; teamwork perception and resource availability. RESULTS: Most of the participants affirmed having reasonable knowledge of delirium, outcomes of delirious episodes, Awakening, Breathing, Coordination, Delirium monitoring/management and Early mobility bundle components and their effectiveness. Low coordination between healthcare professionals was identified as a barrier. Overall, the time elapsing from the beginning of implementation of the bundle determined an increase in levels of awareness and confidence in the application of the bundle protocol and the Confusion Assessment Method Intensive Care Unit scale. CONCLUSION: Issues with the Awakening, Breathing, Coordination, Delirium monitoring/management and Early mobility bundle relating to coordination, management and interdisciplinary ward rounds are critical and should be remedied and monitored. This study could provide the basis for improving bundle implementation strategies and surveying levels of progression in other intensive care units.",0
79,"Analgesia, sedation and delirium management are important parts of intensive care treatment as they are relevant for patients' clinical and functional long-term outcome. Previous surveys showed that despite this fact implementation rates are still low. The primary aim of the prospective, observational multicenter study was to investigate the implementation rate of delirium monitoring among intensivists. Secondly, current practice concerning analgesia and sedation monitoring as well as treatment strategies for patients with delirium were assesed. In addition, this study compares perceived and actual practice regarding delirium, sedation and analgesia management. Data were obtained with a two-part, anonymous survey, containing general data from intensive care units in a first part and data referring to individual patients in a second part. Questionnaires from 101 hospitals (part 1) and 868 patients (part 2) were included in data analysis. Fifty-six percent of the intensive care units reported to monitor for delirium in clinical routine. Fourty-four percent reported the use of a validated delirium score. In this respect, the survey suggests an increasing use of delirium assessment tools compared to previous surveys. Nevertheless, part two of the survey revealed that in actual practice 73% of included patients were not monitored with a validated score. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards moderate or deep sedation which is contradicting to guideline-recommendations. Every fifth patient was suffering from pain. The implementation rate of adequate pain-assessment tools for mechanically ventilated and sedated patients was low (30%). In conclusion, further efforts are necessary to implement guideline recommendations into clinical practice. The study was registered (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01278524) and approved by the ethical committee.",0
80,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of delirium accumulated over the past two decades has focused more on its characteristics, pathophysiology, incidence, aetiology and prognosis as well as interventions for preventing, detecting, evaluating or managing this syndrome and less so on how patients and nurses who care for them experience it. AIMS: To present the state of knowledge derived from qualitative studies of the experiences of persons who suffered delirium and of nurses who cared for them to guide critical care practice. RESULTS: Delirious patients experience incomprehension and various feelings of discomfort. Understanding, support, believing what they are experiencing, explanations, the presence of family/friends and the possibility of talking about the lived experience are interventions that might help them get through such episodes more easily. Nurses who tend to delirious patients fail to comprehend the utterances and behaviours of the persons cared for and experience various feelings of discomfort as well. Nevertheless, they intervene following different goals and intervention strategies that seem to vary as a function of their culture and values. CONCLUSION: Qualitative studies conducted on persons who suffered delirium and on nurses who cared for them have shed light on their lived experience and provide insight on how to improve critical care practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The findings suggest that nurses must acknowledge the lived experience of the persons cared for and they must seek out the meaning that patients ascribe to this experience to understand the situation and thus conduct interventions that meet the needs expressed.",0
81,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2-causing Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), emerged as a public health threat in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Delirium, a dangerous untoward prognostic development, serves as a barometer of systemic injury in critical illness. The early reports of 25% encephalopathy from China are likely a gross underestimation, which we know occurs whenever delirium is not monitored with a valid tool. Indeed, patients with COVID-19 are at accelerated risk for delirium due to at least seven factors including (1) direct central nervous system (CNS) invasion, (2) induction of CNS inflammatory mediators, (3) secondary effect of other organ system failure, (4) effect of sedative strategies, (5) prolonged mechanical ventilation time, (6) immobilization, and (7) other needed but unfortunate environmental factors including social isolation and quarantine without family. Given early insights into the pathobiology of the virus, as well as the emerging interventions utilized to treat the critically ill patients, delirium prevention and management will prove exceedingly challenging, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). The main focus during the COVID-19 pandemic lies within organizational issues, i.e., lack of ventilators, shortage of personal protection equipment, resource allocation, prioritization of limited mechanical ventilation options, and end-of-life care. However, the standard of care for ICU patients, including delirium management, must remain the highest quality possible with an eye towards long-term survival and minimization of issues related to post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). This article discusses how ICU professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacologists) can use our knowledge and resources to limit the burden of delirium on patients by reducing modifiable risk factors despite the imposed heavy workload and difficult clinical challenges posed by the pandemic.",0
83,"BACKGROUND: Family members could play an important role in preventing and reducing the development of delirium in Intensive Care Units (ICU) patients. This study sought to assess the feasibility of design and recruitment, and acceptability for family members and nurses of a family delivered intervention to reduce delirium in ICU patients. METHOD: A single centre randomised controlled trial in an Australian medical/surgical ICU was conducted. Sixty-one family members were randomised (29 in intervention and 32 in non-intervention group). Following instructions, the intervention comprised the family members providing orientation or memory clues (family photographs, orientation to surroundings) to their relative each day. In addition, family members conducted sensory checks (vision and hearing with glasses and hearing aids); and therapeutic or cognitive stimulation (discussing family life, reminiscing) daily. Eleven ICU nurses were interviewed to gain insight into the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the intervention from their perspective. RESULTS: Recruitment rate was 28% of eligible patients (recruited n=90, attrition n=1). Following instruction by the research nurse the family member delivered the intervention which was assessed to be feasible and acceptable by family members and nurses. Protocol adherence could be improved with alternative data collection methods. Nurses considered the activities acceptable. CONCLUSION: The study was able to recruit, randomise and retain family member participants. Further strategies are required to assess intervention fidelity and improve data collection.",0
84,"Agitation and delirium are common reasons for older adults to seek care in the emergency department (ED). Providing care for this population in the ED setting can be challenging for emergency physicians. There are several knowledge translation gaps in how to best screen older adults for these conditions and how to manage them. A working group of subject-matter experts convened to develop an easy-to-use, point-of-care tool to assist emergency physicians in the care of these patients. The tool is designed to serve as a resource to address the knowledge translation and implementation gaps that exist in the field. The purpose of this article is present and explain the Assess, Diagnose, Evaluate, Prevent, and Treat tool. Participants were identified with expertise in emergency medicine, geriatric emergency medicine, geriatrics, and psychiatry. Background literature reviews were performed before the in-person meeting in key areas: delirium, dementia, and agitation in older adults. Participants worked electronically before and after an in-person meeting to finalize development of the tool in 2017. Subsequent work was performed electronically in the following months and additional expert review sought. EDs are an important point of care for older adults. Behavioral changes in older adults can be a manifestation of underlying medical problems, mental health concerns, medication adverse effects, substance abuse, or dementia. Five core principles were identified by the group that can help ensure adequate and thorough care for older adults with agitation or delirium: assess, diagnose, evaluate, prevent, and treat. This article provides background for and explains the importance of these principles related to the care of older adults with agitation. It is important for emergency physicians to recognize the spectrum of underlying causes of behavioral changes and have the tools to screen older adults for those causes, and methods to treat the underlying causes and ameliorate their symptoms.",0
85,"Among care providers, nurses have the most influence on the occurrence of delirium in patients. To identify and investigate the risk factors associated with delirium and analyse the nurse's influence on delirium, a secondary data analysis approach was used with clinical data from the electronic medical record and health care provider data from the management information systems of a university hospital. Data of 3284 patients (delirium = 688, non-delirium = 2596) hospitalized in the medical and surgical intensive care units containing 2178 variables were analysed. Donabedian's structure-process-outcome model was applied to categorize the factors for multilevel hierarchical logistic regression analysis. Sixteen factors (10 patient factors, 1 provider factor, 1 environmental factor, 2 nursing intervention factors and 2 medical intervention factors) were identified as significant in the final model. Longer intensive care unit experience of nurses did not decrease the risk of delirium. Greater number of nursing intervention needs and greater use of restraints were associated with an increased risk of delirium. The duration of nursing career did not affect the reduction of the risk of delirium. Nurses should therefore endeavour to acquire nursing experience specific for delirium care and attend training courses for delirium management.",0
86,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To identify key determinants, which lead to the decision to apply physical or chemical restraint on the critical care unit. BACKGROUND: Psychomotor agitation and hyperactive delirium are frequently cited as clinical rationale for initiating chemical and physical restraint in critical care. Current restraint guidance is over a decade old, and wide variations in nursing and prescribing practice are evident. It is unclear whether restraint use is grounded in evidence-based practice or custom and culture. STUDY DESIGN: Integrative review. METHOD: Seven health sciences databases were searched to identify published and grey literature (1995-2019), with additional hand-searching. The systematic deselection process followed PRISMA guidance. Studies were included if they identified physical or chemical restraint as a method of agitation management in adult critical care units. Quality appraisal was undertaken using Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data were extracted, and thematic analysis undertaken. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies were included. Four main themes were identified: the lack of standardised practice, patient characteristics associated with restraint use, the struggle in practice and the decision to apply restraint. CONCLUSIONS: There are wide variations in restraint use despite the presence of international guidance. Nurses are the primary decision-makers in applying restraint and report that caring for delirious patients is physically and psychologically challenging. The decision to restrain can be influenced by the working environment, patient behaviours and clinical acuity. Enhanced clinical support and guidance for nurses caring for delirious patients is indicated. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Delirium and agitation pose a potential threat to patient safety and the maintenance of life-preserving therapies. Restraint is viewed as one method of preserving patient safety. However, use appears to be influenced by previous adverse experiences and subjective patient descriptors, rather than robust evidence-based knowledge. The need for a precise language to describe restraint and quantify when it becomes necessary is indicated.",0
87,"Pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD) are common in critically ill patients. Consequently, analgesic and sedative medications are frequently administered to critically ill patients to treat PAD, to improve synchrony with mechanical ventilation, and to decrease the physiological stress response. However, prolonged, continuous deep sedation of intensive care unit (ICU) patients is associated with numerous adverse outcomes, including longer durations of mechanical ventilation, prolonged ICU stays, acute brain dysfunction, and an increased risk of death. The 2013 ICU PAD Guidelines were developed to provide a clear, evidence-based road map for clinicians to better manage PAD in critically ill patients. Significant knowledge gaps in these areas still remain, but if widely adopted, the PAD Guidelines can help bridge these gaps and will be transformative in terms of their impact on ICU care. Strong evidence indicates that linking PAD management strategies with ventilator weaning, early mobility, and sleep hygiene in ICU patients will result in significant synergistic benefits to patient care and reductions in costs. An interdisciplinary team-based approach, using proven process improvement strategies, and ICU patient and family activation and engagement, will help ensure successful implementation of the ICU PAD Care Bundle in ICUs. This paper highlights the major recommendations of the 2013 ICU PAD Guidelines. We hope this review will help ICU physicians and other health care providers advance the management of PAD in critically ill patients, and improve patients' clinical outcomes.",0
88,"Although growing evidence supports the safety and effectiveness of the ABCDEF bundle (A, assess, prevent, and manage pain; B, both spontaneous awakening and spontaneous breathing trials; C, choice of analgesic and sedation; D, delirium: assess, prevent, and manage; E, early mobility and exercise; and F, family engagement and empowerment), intensive care unit providers often struggle with how to reliably and consistently incorporate this interprofessional, evidence-based intervention into everyday clinical practice. Recently, the Society of Critical Care Medicine completed the ICU Liberation ABCDEF Bundle Improvement Collaborative, a 20-month, nationwide, multicenter quality improvement initiative that formalized dissemination and implementation strategies and tracked key performance metrics to overcome barriers to ABCDEF bundle adoption. The purpose of this article is to discuss some of the most challenging implementation issues that Collaborative teams experienced, and to provide some practical advice from leading experts on ways to overcome these barriers.",0
89,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the knowledge and use of the Assessment, prevention, and management of pain; spontaneous awakening and breathing trials; Choice of analgesia and sedation; Delirium assessment; Early mobility and exercise; and Family engagement and empowerment (ABCDEF) bundle to implement the Pain, Agitation, Delirium guidelines. DESIGN: Worldwide online survey. SETTING: Intensive care. INTERVENTION: A cross-sectional online survey using the Delphi method was administered to intensivists worldwide, to assess the knowledge and use of all aspects of the ABCDEF bundle. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 1,521 respondents from 47 countries, 57% had implemented the ABCDEF bundle, with varying degrees of compliance across continents. Most of the respondents (83%) used a scale to evaluate pain. Spontaneous awakening trials and spontaneous breathing trials are performed in 66% and 67% of the responder ICUs, respectively. Sedation scale was used in 89% of ICUs. Delirium monitoring was implemented in 70% of ICUs, but only 42% used a validated delirium tool. Likewise, early mobilization was ""prescribed"" by most, but 69% had no mobility team and 79% used no formal mobility scale. Only 36% of the respondents assessed ICU-acquired weakness. Family members were actively involved in 67% of ICUs; however, only 33% used dedicated staff to support families and only 35% reported that their unit was open 24 hr/d for family visits. CONCLUSIONS: The current implementation of the ABCDEF bundle varies across individual components and regions. We identified specific targets for quality improvement and adoption of the ABCDEF bundle. Our data reflect a significant but incomplete shift toward patient- and family-centered ICU care in accordance with the Pain, Agitation, Delirium guidelines.",0
90,"OBJECTIVE: The awakening and breathing coordination, delirium monitoring/management, and early exercise/mobility bundle is an evidence-based interprofessional multicomponent strategy for minimizing sedative exposure, reducing duration of mechanical ventilation, and managing ICU-acquired delirium and weakness. The purpose of this study was to identify facilitators and barriers to awakening and breathing coordination, delirium monitoring/management, and early exercise/mobility bundle adoption and to evaluate the extent to which bundle implementation was effective, sustainable, and conducive to dissemination. DESIGN: Prospective, before-after, mixed-methods study. SETTING: Five adult ICUs, one step-down unit, and a special care unit located in a 624-bed academic medical center SUBJECTS: : Interprofessional ICU team members at participating institution. INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENTS: In collaboration with the participating institution, we developed, implemented, and refined an awakening and breathing coordination, delirium monitoring/management, and early exercise/mobility bundle policy. Over the course of an 18-month period, all ICU team members were offered the opportunity to participate in numerous multimodal educational efforts. Three focus group sessions, three online surveys, and one educational evaluation were administered in an attempt to identify facilitators and barriers to bundle adoption. MAIN RESULTS: Factors believed to facilitate bundle implementation included: 1) the performance of daily, interdisciplinary, rounds; 2) engagement of key implementation leaders; 3) sustained and diverse educational efforts; and 4) the bundle's quality and strength. Barriers identified included: 1) intervention-related issues (e.g., timing of trials, fear of adverse events), 2) communication and care coordination challenges, 3) knowledge deficits, 4) workload concerns, and 5) documentation burden. Despite these challenges, participants believed implementation ultimately benefited patients, improved interdisciplinary communication, and empowered nurses and other ICU team members. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of the implementation of the awakening and breathing coordination, delirium monitoring/management, and early exercise/mobility bundle in a tertiary care setting, clear factors were identified that both advanced and impeded adoption of this complex intervention that requires interprofessional education, coordination, and cooperation. Focusing on these factors preemptively should enable a more effective and lasting implementation of the bundle and better care for critically ill patients. Lessons learned from this study will also help healthcare providers optimize implementation of the recent ICU pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines, which has many similarities but also some important differences as compared with the awakening and breathing coordination, delirium monitoring/management, and early exercise/mobility bundle.",0
91,"INTRODUCTION: This study hypothesised that a reduction of sound during the night using earplugs could be beneficial in the prevention of intensive care delirium. Two research questions were formulated. First, does the use of earplugs during the night reduce the onset of delirium or confusion in the ICU? Second, does the use of earplugs during the night improve the quality of sleep in the ICU? METHODS: A randomized clinical trial included adult intensive care patients in an intervention group of 69 patients sleeping with earplugs during the night and a control group of 67 patients sleeping without earplugs during the night. The researchers were blinded during data collection. Assignment was performed by an independent nurse researcher using a computer program. Eligible patients had an expected length of stay in the ICU of more than 24 hours, were Dutch- or English-speaking and scored a minimum Glasgow Coma Scale of 10. Delirium was assessed using the validated NEECHAM scale, sleep perception was reported by the patient in response to five questions. RESULTS: The use of earplugs during the night lowered the incidence of confusion in the studied intensive care patients. A vast improvement was shown by a Hazard Ratio of 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.82). Also, patients sleeping with earplugs developed confusion later than the patients sleeping without earplugs. After the first night in the ICU, patients sleeping with earplugs reported a better sleep perception. CONCLUSIONS: Earplugs may be a useful instrument in the prevention of confusion or delirium. The beneficial effects seem to be strongest within 48 hours after admission. The relation between sleep, sound and delirium, however, needs further research.

92,"BACKGROUND: The intensive care unit (ICU) stay has been linked with a number of physical and psychological sequelae, known collectively as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Specific ICU follow-up services are relatively recent developments in health systems, and may have the potential to address PICS through targeting unmet health needs arising from the experience of the ICU stay. There is currently no single accepted model of follow-up service and current aftercare programmes encompass a variety of interventions and materials. There is uncertain evidence about whether follow-up services effectively address PICS, and this review assesses this. OBJECTIVES: Our main objective was to assess the effectiveness of follow-up services for ICU survivors that aim to identify and address unmet health needs related to the ICU period. We aimed to assess effectiveness in relation to health-related quality of life (HRQoL), mortality, depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), physical function, cognitive function, ability to return to work or education and adverse effects.Our secondary objectives were to examine different models of follow-up services. We aimed to explore: the effectiveness of service organisation (physician- versus nurse-led, face-to-face versus remote, timing of follow-up service); differences related to country (high-income versus low- and middle-income countries); and effect of delirium, which can subsequently affect cognitive function, and the effect of follow-up services may differ for these participants. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL on 7 November 2017. We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and non-randomised studies with adult participants, who had been discharged from hospital following an ICU stay. We included studies that compared an ICU follow-up service using a structured programme and co-ordinated by a healthcare professional versus no follow-up service or standard care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesised findings. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included five studies (four randomised studies; one non-randomised study), for a total of 1707 participants who were ICU survivors with a range of illness severities and conditions. Follow-up services were led by nurses in four studies or a multidisciplinary team in one study. They included face-to-face consultations at home or in a clinic, or telephone consultations or both. Each study included at least one consultation (weekly, monthly, or six-monthly), and two studies had up to eight consultations. Although the design of follow-up service consultations differed in each study, we noted that each service included assessment of participants' needs with referrals to specialist support if required.It was not feasible to blind healthcare professionals or participants to the intervention and we did not know whether this may have introduced performance bias. We noted baseline differences (two studies), and services included additional resources (two studies), which may have influenced results, and one non-randomised study had high risk of selection bias.We did not combine data from randomised studies with data from one non-randomised study. Follow-up services for improving long-term outcomes in ICU survivors may make little or no difference to HRQoL at 12 months (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.1 to 0.1; 1 study; 286 participants; low-certainty evidence). We found moderate-certainty evidence from five studies that they probably also make little or no difference to all-cause mortality up to 12 months after ICU discharge (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.22; 4 studies; 1289 participants; and in one non-randomised study 79/259 deaths in the intervention group, and 46/151 in the control group) and low-certainty evidence from four studies that they may make little or no difference to PTSD (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10, 703 participants, 3 studies; and one non-randomised study reported less chance of PTSD when a follow-up service was used).It is uncertain whether using a follow-up service reduces depression and anxiety (3 studies; 843 participants), physical function (4 studies; 1297 participants), cognitive function (4 studies; 1297 participants), or increases the ability to return to work or education (1 study; 386 participants), because the certainty of this evidence is very low. No studies measured adverse effects.We could not assess our secondary objectives because we found insufficient studies to justify subgroup analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found insufficient evidence, from a limited number of studies, to determine whether ICU follow-up services are effective in identifying and addressing the unmet health needs of ICU survivors. We found five ongoing studies which are not included in this review; these ongoing studies may increase our certainty in the effect in future updates. Because of limited data, we were unable to explore whether one design of follow-up service is preferable to another, or whether a service is more effective for some people than others, and we anticipate that future studies may also vary in design. We propose that future studies are designed with robust methods (for example randomised studies are preferable) and consider only one variable (the follow-up service) compared to standard care; this would increase confidence that the effect is due to the follow-up service rather than concomitant therapies.",0
93,"BACKGROUND: Lack of evidence regarding whether a useful examination instrument such as an multiple choice question (MCQ) quiz is reliable for assessing delirium care knowledge. AIM: To develop and psychometrically test a MCQ-based quiz for assessing the delirium care knowledge in critical care nurses. DESIGN: Instrument development and psychometric evaluation study. METHODS: The development and validation process consisted of two phases. The first Phase focused on the quiz development, which was achieved through the following steps: (a) generation of an initial 20-item pool; (b) assessment of content validity; (c) assessment of face validity; (d) conduction of a pilot test, involving the collection of data from 217 critical care nurses through an online survey; and (e) item analysis and item elimination according to item difficulty and discrimination indices. The MCQ quiz was finalized through the development process. The second phase emphasized quiz validation through estimation of the internal consistency, split-half and test-retest reliability, and construct validity using parallel analysis with exploratory factor analysis (EFA). RESULTS: A final 16-item MCQ quiz was emerged from the item analysis. The Kuder-Richardson formula 20 coefficient for the overall quiz indicated good internal consistency (0.85), and the intraclass correlation coefficient with a 30-day interval also indicated that the questionnaire had satisfactory stability (0.97). EFA confirmed that the quiz had appropriate construct validity, and four factors could explain 60.87% of the total variance. CONCLUSION: In this study, the MCQ, and single best answer quiz for assessing delirium care knowledge was developed, and its reliability and validity for this purpose were demonstrated. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study introduced an evidence-based quiz designed for future use in delirium care research and education that has significant implications for MCQ-based knowledge assessment in clinical practice.",0
94,"DESCRIPTION: The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on the appropriate use of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in hospitalized patients for initial or postextubation management of acute respiratory failure. It is based on the best available evidence on the benefits and harms of HFNO, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences. METHODS: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of HFNO. The patient-centered health outcomes evaluated included all-cause mortality, hospital length of stay, 30-day hospital readmissions, hospital-acquired pneumonia, days of intubation or reintubation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and ICU transfers, patient comfort, dyspnea, delirium, barotrauma, compromised nutrition, gastric dysfunction, functional independence at discharge, discharge disposition, and skin breakdown. This guideline was developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method. TARGET AUDIENCE AND PATIENT POPULATION: The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adult patients with acute respiratory failure treated in a hospital setting (including emergency departments, hospital wards, intermediate or step-down units, and ICUs). RECOMMENDATION 1A: ACP suggests that clinicians use high-flow nasal oxygen rather than noninvasive ventilation in hospitalized adults for the management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). RECOMMENDATION 1B: ACP suggests that clinicians use high-flow nasal oxygen rather than conventional oxygen therapy for hospitalized adults with postextubation acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).",0
95,"BACKGROUND: Physical restraint is still widely used despite studies supporting a reduction in its use. The development of guidelines to reduce the use of PR first requires the identification of factors related to the use of alternative methods. AIM: This study aimed to determine factors associated with the use of alternatives to physical restraint (PR) in intensive care units. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study. METHODS: Data were collected from adult intensive care units of three hospitals in Turkey using the Physical Restraint Knowledge, Attitude and Practice Scale and a questionnaire including open-ended questions. RESULTS: Overall, 202 nurses (80% response rate) completed the questionnaire. Nurses' knowledge, attitude, and practice scores regarding PR were 6.89 ± 1.79, 29.85 ± 4.93, and 36.76 ± 3.36, respectively. PR was reported to be necessary for patients at risk of self-harm, with dangerous behaviours, and who were trying to remove their catheters. Most nurses (64.9%) stated that they needed a written doctor's order. Analysis of free-text responses showed that patient disorientation (because of delirium, sedation, or agitation), nurses' workload, and lack of training regarding restraint were the primary reasons why nurses could not use alternatives. The main alternatives suggested by nurses were categorized as sedation, communication, and environmental regulation. Logistic regression analysis identified training (P = .009), working unit (P = .001), and nurses' practice score to use PR (P = .004) as independent risk factors for not using alternative methods of PR. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed a moderate level of knowledge, attitude, and practice among nurses regarding the use of PR. Thus, education of nurses about the prevention of delirium and alternatives to PR according to the characteristics of their units is required. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Clinical guidelines and in-service training need to be developed to increase the use of alternatives to PR and delirium management.",0
96,"BACKGROUND: Nurses' competency in delirium care is important because delirium can extend hospitalization and increase patient mortality. AIM: This study aimed at identifying and comparing the perceived knowledge, barriers, importance, performance, and training priorities between the intensive care unit (ICU) and ward nurses working in delirium care. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional descriptive study included 71 ICU nurses and 149 ward nurses at one university hospital. Nurses' self-reported knowledge, barriers, importance, and performance of delirium care were surveyed. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and the importance-performance analysis matrix. RESULTS: Compared to ward nurses, ICU nurses reported lower overall knowledge level (57.1% vs 60.7%, z = -2.005, P = .045) but higher overall gap between the importance and performance of delirium care (0.5 vs 0.2, z = -4.008, P < .001). The level of overall barriers to delirium care was similar between the two groups (3.8 vs 3.8, z = -1.190, P = .234). The highest training priority, showing high importance but low performance in the importance-performance matrix, was ""family involvement and education"" for ICU nurses and ""non-pharmacological management"" for ward nurses. CONCLUSIONS: The highest training priority for delirium care was different between ICU and ward nurses. To enhance the delirium care competency of hospital nurses, the nurse educator should develop training programs that target knowledge deficits, perceived barriers, and training priorities. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Acute cognitive disturbances are common in patients hospitalized in wards and ICUs and can lead to adverse patient outcomes if not properly assessed and managed. Nurse educators need to develop and implement a training program based on the needs assessment and priorities identified in this study so that ICU and ward nurses can obtain the optimal level of delirium care competency.",0
97,"Delirium is a critical issue in the intensive care unit (ICU), and the correct diagnosis and treatment of this disorder by the ICU team are doubtful on many occasions due to a lack of information. This research is intended to test the awareness and control of ICU delirium by the ICU nurses. A nonexperimental, quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted using a previously adopted and translated to Arabic and validated questionnaire. The sample include nurses who work in ICUs of 10 Palestinian hospitals (private and public) located in the West Bank and Jerusalem participated in this study; each gave consent to be part of this study. Approval was received from the Palestinian Ministry of Health and the Ethical Committee at Birzeit University. Version 19 of the Social Sciences Statistical Package (SPSS) software was used to analyze the data. The results showed that ICU nurses hold moderate to low levels of knowledge and lack of adequate clinical experience to handle delirium. Delirium is a common complication in the ICU that increases morbidity and mortality and increases the length of ICU stay, therefore the cost of health care rise and the quality of life is decreased. In clinical practice, there are no assessment guidelines and protocols for patients with delirium.",0
98,"PURPOSE: A diagnosis of delirium places a critically ill child at risk of increased morbidity/mortality. Although delirium is common in critically ill children, only 2% of pediatric intensive care units (PICU) screen for delirium. The impediments to screening include knowledge deficits regarding delirium and delirium screening tools. The purpose of this improvement science project was two-fold. The first was to implement delirium screening in a PICU. The second was to evaluate the impact of multifaceted education on PICU nurses' delirium knowledge, self-confidence and attitude towards delirium. DESIGN & METHOD: A series of three plan-do-study-act cycles (PDSA) were used to implement this practice change. Multifaceted education was provided during the PDSA cycles. Two questionnaires were used to assess for changes in delirium knowledge, self-confidence and attitude towards delirium among PICU nurses. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Forty-two PICU nurses completed a questionnaire measuring delirium knowledge, self-confidence, and attitude during each PDSA cycle. A significant increase in delirium knowledge, self-confidence, and attitude towards delirium was found after education (p = .003; p < .001; p = .036) and 3 months post implementation of delirium screening (p = .023; p < .001; p = .027) as compared to pre-education. CONCLUSION & PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Multifaceted education is a successful tool in improving nurses' knowledge, self-confidence and attitude regarding delirium. The use of PDSA cycles is a practical systematic method to improve quality of care. Improving knowledge, self-confidence and attitude have the potential to mitigate adverse effects of delirium in the critically ill child.",0
99,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine perceived barriers to assessment of delirium for critical care nurses, and the impact of education on their knowledge and practice. BACKGROUND: Delirium is a significant problem in critical care, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Many authors have found variations in assessment by critical care nurses, but there has been limited analysis of the reasons for this. Education on the topic improves knowledge and practice, but the best approach has not been examined. DESIGN: A questionnaire survey design. METHODS: A self-reported questionnaire was distributed to critical care nurses (n=31) at a district general hospital. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Knowledge and practice were variable, but correlation was seen between nursing band and years of experience with better scores. Any type of education led to significantly improved scores. Several barriers to assessment were found, with the most common being lack of knowledge and difficulty in assessing intubated patients. CONCLUSION: It is essential to improve practice in delirium assessment and management. Education is vital to improve the knowledge and practice of critical care nurses regarding delirium.",0
100,"BACKGROUND: Since its foundation in 2011, the German Network for Early Mobilization of mechanically ventilated intensive care patients delivered, among others, more than 90 monthly newsletters, 14 research projects, and 3 national conferences. PURPOSE: The aim of this online survey was to evaluate whether members of the Network perceived a professional benefit for themselves and their intensive cate units (ICU). METHODS: An interprofessional online survey of 303 clinicians of the Network in German speaking countries in July 2019 was undertaken. The survey included questions about newsletters, personal benefits, perceived improvements on their workplaces, and future expectations. RESULTS: The response rate was 48% (n = 145), mainly nurses and physiotherapists. The majority perceived the newsletter as good. Members reported that the network extended their professional knowledge and improved the quality of the ICUs regarding early mobilization, delirium management, and interprofessional goals. Participants expressed a wish for more workshops, case reports, webinars, and other educational possibilities. CONCLUSIONS: Members of the network Early Mobilization perceived a personal and professional benefit. The network supported quality improvements projects in ICUs. The progress of the network may serve as an example for development of other professional networks.",0
101,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the experiences in nursing care in the prevention and treatment of delirium in people hospitalized in intensive care units. METHODOLOGY: Hermeneutic phenomenological qualitative study. The selection of participants was by intentional sampling: seven nursing assistants and eight nurses. Theoretical saturation was achieved. The phenomenological interview was applied to collect data from a central question and the analysis was carried out following the approaches of Heidegger's hermeneutical circle. RESULTS: Four significant themes emerged from the analysis: 1) Delirium prevention, 2) Pharmacological treatment, 3) Non-pharmacological treatment, and 4) Barriers to non-pharmacological treatment. These themes were accompanied by 35 interrelated units of meaning: in the first theme, the most repetitive units were communication, orientation, and family bonding; in the second was the use of pharmacological treatment only in the acute phase; in the third was the modification of the environment according to the patient's preference (where the family is a priority and strategies that provide cognitive and social stimulation can be reinforced), and in the fourth was the work overload for the nursing team. CONCLUSIONS: The experiences of the nursing team in the prevention and treatment of delirium in critically ill patients highlight that communication allows an approach to the patient as a human being immersed in a reality, with a personal history, needs and preferences. Therefore, family members must be involved in these scenarios, as they can complement and support nursing care.",0
102,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common, devastating, and underrecognized syndrome in the intensive care unit (ICU). The study aimed to describe and evaluate a multicomponent education and training program utilizing a ""Train-The-Trainer"" (TTT) model, to improve delirium detection across a large health system. METHODS: Fourteen ICUs across nine hospitals participated in a multicomponent delirium program consisting of a 1-day workshop that included: (1) patient testimonials, (2) small group discussions, (3) didactics, and (4) role-playing. Additionally, four ICUs received direct observation/training via telehealth (tele-delirium training). The Kirkpatrick model was used for program evaluation in a pre/post-test design. RESULTS: A 1-day delirium workshop was held at two time points and included 73 ICU nurses. Of the 65 nurses completing the post-workshop satisfaction survey, most (46.2) had >10 years of clinical experience, and no or minimal delirium training (69.2%). All nurses (100%) identified lack of knowledge as a barrier to delirium detection, while time constraints and lack of importance accounted for only 25%. Overall, nurses rated the workshop positively (excellent 66.7%, and very good 23.3%), and likely to change practice (definitely 73.3% and very likely 15.0%). All validated Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) cases demonstrated improvement in number of correct responses. Delirium detection across the health system improved from 9.1% at baseline to 21.2% in ICUs that participated in the workshop and 30.1% in those ICUs that also participated in the tele-delirium training (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: A multicomponent delirium education and training program using a TTT model was rated positively, improved CAM-ICU knowledge, and increased delirium detection.",0
103,"BACKGROUND: The ABCDE (Awakening and Breathing Coordination, Delirium monitoring and management, and Early exercise/mobility) bundle has been associated with reductions in delirium incidence and improved patient outcomes but has not been widely adopted. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine how to facilitate ABCDE bundle adoption by examining the impact of different implementation strategies on bundle adherence rates and assessing clinicians' perceptions of the bundle and implementation efforts. METHODS: This study examined the effect of 2 bundle implementation strategies on patient care in 8 adult intensive care units. The basic strategy included electronic health record (EHR) modification, whereas the enhanced strategy included EHR modification plus additional bundle training, clinical champions, and staff engagement. A total of 84 nurses, physicians, and therapists participated in interviews and a survey to assess bundle implementation. RESULTS: Respondents indicated bundle use resulted in ""best care"" through care standardization and coordination and improved patient outcomes. Intensive care units in both intervention groups had significant improvements in bundle adherence after implementation efforts, but intensive care units in the basic intervention group outperformed other sites after initiating their own implementation strategies. Successful implementation tactics included incorporating the bundle into multidisciplinary rounds and providing ongoing support, training, and routine auditing and feedback. DISCUSSION: The ABCDE bundle can improve quality of care and outcomes, and implementation can be accelerated through EHR tools, trainings, and performance feedback.",0
104,"The critical care environment is an experience of stress for the patient and the practitioner. Turbulence can occur during the critical care course, which can cause exacerbation of chronic conditions. These exacerbations can lead to delirium and/or psychosis. Nursing professionals must be alert to changes in all conditions which increase morbidity and mortality in the critical care patient. Although critical care nurses may feel unable to care for the psychiatric needs of clients with a chronic mental disorder, implementing tools to aid in assessment will empower the nurses. Truly, the key to viewing all clients is wholly, rather than by diagnosis. Critical care nurses care for clients with many comorbidities and illnesses. Many conditions may be a new experience. Mental disorders should not be viewed as being out of the scope of the critical care nurse. On the contrary, mental disorders are chronic conditions, not unlike diabetes mellitus or congestive heart failure. What the critical care nurse needs is a knowledge base in order to feel more comfortable in caring for these clients. Knowledge is empowerment.",0
105,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common condition in critically ill patients, affecting nearly half of all patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Family caregivers of critically ill patients can be partners in the early recognition, prevention and management of delirium provided they are aware of the signs/symptoms and appropriate non-pharmacological strategies that might be taken. Valid, reliable instruments that assess family caregiver knowledge are essential so that nurses can prepare family caregivers to be effective partners. The purpose of the current study was to (a) adapt an existing caregiver delirium knowledge questionnaire (CDKQ) for use by nurses to measure a family caregiver's delirium knowledge in the ICU; and (b) examine the psychometric properties and structure of the adapted Caregiver ICU Delirium Knowledge Questionnaire (CIDKQ). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a multidisciplinary team developed the 21-item CIDKQ (possible score range: 0-21) and administered it to 158 family caregivers of critically ill patients. Descriptive statistics were examined for all variables. The CIDKQ was analyzed for face validity, content validity, reliability and internal consistency. RESULTS: The mean CIDKQ score was 14.1 (SD: 3.5, range = 2 to 21). Path analysis revealed that a family caregiver's delirium knowledge in the actions and symptoms dimensions had a direct effect on knowledge of delirium risk factors. The CIDKQ was found to have face validity and reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated good validity and reliability of the CIDKQ as a measure of ICU delirium knowledge in family caregivers of critically ill patients.",0
106,"PURPOSE: Describe nurses' ability to recognize delirium on both intensive care unit and medical-surgical units. DESIGN: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study using a convenience sample. SAMPLE AND SETTING: Sixty-one registered nurses (RNs) were recruited from both medical-surgical and intensive care units from 2 midsized hospitals in the Midwest. METHODS: : For this study, a survey was developed using true/false and Likert-type scale questions to assess (1) nurse knowledge of symptoms associated with delirium, (2) negative sequelae associated with delirium, and (3) confidence levels regarding assessing for delirium. CONCLUSION: Tremendous opportunity exists in nursing education for learning about negative outcomes associated with delirium and the importance of routine assessment. Clarification of negative sequelae related to delirium will lead nurses to value and understand the importance of early detection. Appropriate use of a standard cognitive assessment and an instrument designed to detect delirium is vital in a successful delirium prevention program. Providing nurses with educational resources and opportunities to apply knowledge will increase confidence in identification and management of delirium.",0
107,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a complex syndrome prevalent in the intensive care unit. It has been associated with significant morbidity including distress, longer hospital stays, prolonged cognitive impairment, and increased mortality. OBJECTIVE: To describe a nurse-led interdisciplinary quality improvement initiative to increase nurses' knowledge of delirium, documentation of delirium assessment, and patient mobility. METHODS: Sixty-seven nurses in medical and surgical intensive care units were required to attend an interactive education program on delirium assessment and management. Scores on tests taken before and after the education program were used to evaluate knowledge. Medical records and bedside rounds were used to validate Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit documentation and interventions. Descriptive statistics were used to describe changes over time. A delirium resource team composed of nurses, physicians, and therapists provided didactic education paired with simulation training and bedside coaching. Mobility screening tests and computer templates guided assessments and interventions. RESULTS: Documentation of the Confusion Assessment Method improved from less than 50% to consistently 99%. Mobilization in the surgical intensive care unit increased from 90% to 98% after intervention. Days of delirium significantly decreased from 51% before intervention to 31% after intervention (χ12=7.01, P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: The success of this quality improvement project to enhance recognition of delirium and increase mobility (critical components of the pain assessment, breathing, sedation choice, delirium, early mobility, and family education bundle) was contingent on nursing leaders hip, interdisciplinary team collaboration, and interactive education.",0
108,"Delirium is the most common form of cerebral dysfunction in intensive care patients and is a medical emergency that must be avoided or promptly diagnosed and treated. According to current knowledge the development of delirium seems to be caused by an interplay between increased vulnerability (predisposition) and simultaneous exposure to delirogenic factors. Since delirium is often overlooked in the clinical routine, a continuous screening for delirium should be performed. Due to the close connection between delirium, agitation and pain, sedation and analgesia must be evaluated at least every 8 h analogous to delirium screening. According to current knowledge, a multifactorial and multiprofessional approach is favored in the prevention and treatment of delirium. Non-pharmaceutical interventions through early mobilization, reorientation, sleep improvement, adequate pain therapy and avoidance of polypharmacy are of great importance. Depending on the clinical picture, different substances are used in symptom-oriented drug treatment of delirium. In order to achieve these diagnostic and therapeutic goals, an interdisciplinary treatment team consisting of intensive care, intensive care physicians, ward pharmacists, physiotherapists, nutrition specialists and psychiatrists is necessary in order to meet the requirements of the patient and their relatives.",0
109,"Delirium, the most frequent complication of hospitalized older adults, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs), can result in increased mortality rates and length of stay. Nurses are neither consistently identifying nor managing delirium in these patients. The purpose of this study was to explore ICU nurses' identification of delirium, actions they would take for patients with signs or symptoms of delirium, and beliefs about delirium assessment and management. In this cross-sectional study using qualitative descriptive methods guided by the theory of planned behavior, 30 ICU nurses' responses to patient vignettes depicting different delirium subtypes were explored. Descriptive and content analyses revealed that nurses did not consistently identify delirium; their actions varied in different vignettes. Nurses believed that they needed adequate staffing, balanced workload, interprofessional collaboration, and established policy and protocols to identify and manage delirium successfully. Research is needed to determine if implementing these changes increases recognition and decreases consequences of delirium.",0
110,"BACKGROUND: The literature regarding nurses' experiences of caring for chronically critically ill (CCI) patients is scant, however, there are subtleties within the literature, identifying nurses are often challenged providing care to this patient group. This can lead to feeling frustrated, lack of control, and distress. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: As part of a larger study, this paper reports nurses' experiences of caring for patients during a prolonged critical illness in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN: A longitudinal, qualitative, instrumental, multi-case study consisting of six cases from four New Zealand ICUs was conducted. Theoretical underpinnings were informed by the Chronic Illness Trajectory Framework. The principles of consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research were applied in reporting the methods and findings. METHODS: Patients, family members, nurses, and other health care professionals constituted the participant groups in the larger body of work. Data were collected from observations, conversations, interviews, and document review. Data were analysed by identifying themes, developing vignettes, and trajectory mapping. RESULTS: Nurses' experiences of caring for CCI patients in the ICU can be framed by a prolonged critical illness trajectory that is unpredictable, problematic, and prolonged. Nurses experienced distress in one of the phases in the trajectory because of uncertainty about a positive outcome for the patient related to multiple complications, with anxiety, delirium, and the suffering they witnessed. Nurses were frustrated and challenged to meet all the patient's needs because of the many tasks they needed to complete over the shift. CONCLUSION: Understanding the trajectory of a prolonged critical illness from the perspective of nurses, allows for challenges to be identified and is the first step in improving practice through the education of nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Understanding the challenges posed by caring for CCI patients will assist in improving their interactions and prioritizing their care for nurses.",0
111,"PURPOSE: Delirium is a disorder of decreased ability to focus, sustain or shift attention, change in cognition and or perception. The main objective was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) among the nursing and medical staff in a multidisciplinary ICU. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Three hundred ten verbally communicating and non-communicating patients (mean age in years 47.9, standard deviation [SD] 14.5, mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 13.8, SD 6.4) were assessed by a psychiatrist, nurse and intensivist for delirium. Inter-rater agreement was measured by Cohen's kappa coefficient. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated. RESULTS: CAM-ICU showed higher sensitivity and DOR (84%, 86.1) compared to ICDSC (78%, 36.9). ICDSC had specificity and positive predictive value (94.5%, 92%) equal to that of CAM-ICU. For both the assessment methods (CAM-ICU and ICDSC), DORs for intensivists (120.5, 53.0) were relatively higher than nurses (67.0, 27.0). CONCLUSIONS: In our mixed ICU population, CAM-ICU remained more sensitive than ICDSC. Though sensitivity and DOR were higher for medical staff, other diagnostic parameters were similar for both medical and nursing staff.",0
112,"BACKGROUND: Implementation of quality improvement interventions can be enhanced by exploring the perspectives of those who will deliver and receive them. We designed a non-pharmacological bundle for delirium management for a feasibility trial, and we sought to obtain the views of intensive care unit (ICU) staff, survivors, and families on the barriers and facilitators to its implementation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the barriers and facilitators to a multicomponent bundle for delirium management in critically ill patients comprising (1) education and family participation, (2) sedation minimisation and pain, agitation, and delirium protocol, (3) early mobilisation, and (4) environmental interventions for sleep, orientation, communication, and cognitive stimulation. METHODS: Nine focus group interviews were conducted with ICU staff (n = 68) in 12 UK ICUs. Three focus group interviews were conducted with ICU survivors (n = 12) and their family members (n = 2). Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed using the Braun and Clarke framework. RESULTS: Overall, staff, survivors, and their families agreed the bundle was acceptable. Facilitating factors for delivering the bundle were staff and relatives' education about potential benefits and encouraging family presence. Facilitating factors for sedation minimisation were evening ward rounds, using non-verbal pain scores, and targeting sedation scores. Barriers identified by staff were inadequate resources, poor education, relatives' anxiety, safety concerns, and ICU culture. Concerns were raised about patient confidentiality when displaying orientation materials and managing resources for early mobility. Survivors cited that flexible visiting and re-establishing normality were important factors; and staff workload, lack of awareness, and poor communication were factors that needed to be considered before implementation. CONCLUSION: Generally, the bundle was deemed acceptable and deliverable. However, like any complex intervention, component adaptations will be required depending on resources available to the ICU; in particular, involvement of pharmacists in the ward round and physiotherapists in mobilising intubated patients.",0
113,"BACKGROUND: Improving care of critically ill patients requires using an interprofessional care model and care standardisation. OBJECTIVES: Determine whether collaborative patient care rounds in the intensive care unit increases practice consistency with respect to common considerations such as delirium prevention, device use, and indicated prophylaxis, among others. Secondary objective to assess whether collaborative interprofessional format improved nursing perceptions of collaboration. METHODS: Single centre, pre- and post- intervention design. collaborative patient care rounding format implemented in three intensive care units in an academic tertiary care centre. format consisted of scripted nursing presentation, provider checklist of additional practice considerations, and daily priority goals documentation. measurements included nursing participation, consideration of selected practice items, daily goal verbalisation, and nursing perception of collaboration. RESULTS: Pre- and post-intervention measurements indicate gains in consideration of eight of thirteen bundle items (p < 0.05), with the greatest gains seen in nurse-presented items. Increases were observed in verbalisation of daily goals (59.8% versus 89.1%, p < 0.0001), nurse participation (83.9% versus 91.8%, p = 0.056), and nurse collaboration ratings (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study describes implementation of collaborative patient care rounds with corresponding increases in consideration of selected practice items, verbalisation of daily goals, and perceptions of collaboration.",0
114,"The purpose of this integrative review was to evaluate the literature from January 2013 to April 2020 and to explore critical care nurses' perspectives of and intent to use recommended Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption (PADIS) patient assessment tools in adult critical care units. A literature search was performed with a total of 47 studies included in the final analysis for this review. The studies' data were organized and further reduced based on The Reasoned Action Approach behavioral theory to reflect the extent to which a nurse plans to use a PADIS assessment tool. Extracted themes were related to behavioral beliefs in patient-centered care and critical thinking; normative beliefs about communication and prioritization; and control beliefs concerning autonomy and confidence. Contextualizing the international phenomenon of variation in PADIS assessment tool use by critical care nurses provides a deeper understanding of its complexity for use in the clinical setting.",0
115,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the validity and reliability of the Delirium Knowledge Test for the Intensive Care Nurse. METHOD: The item analysis and reliability of the test was assessed in a sample of 274 nurses working in the internal and surgical adult intensive care units of one public and three university hospitals in Turkey between 15 May and 15 August 2017. Content and face validity, item analysis and reliability coefficients were used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the test. RESULTS: The item difficulty index and item discrimination index of the questions included in the draft form of the 40-item test were found to range from 0.22 to 0.93 and from 0.06 to 0.51, respectively. At the end of the analyses, 14 items were excluded from the draft test, 11 according to the item difficulty index and 3 according to the item discrimination index. Correspondingly, the final version of the test consisted of 26 questions. The item difficulty index of the final test was 0.22 to 0.79, and the item discrimination index was 0.20 to 0.51. The difficulty level of the final test was found to be 59%, and the Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was 0.83. CONCLUSION: The results of the study showed that the test had good content and face validity and reliability for measuring the delirium knowledge of intensive care nurses.",0
116,"BACKGROUND: The Pain, Agitation, and Delirium guidelines influenced practice to support targeted, light sedation for the mechanically ventilated patient. This practice is associated with improved clinical outcomes, but it remains unclear how it impacts the patient experience. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the pervasive patient experience components and how the experience may have been influenced by targeted, light sedation practices. METHODS: A prospective observational study using mixed methodology and a convenience sample was conducted after institutional review board approval was obtained. Inclusion criteria were the following: acute mechanical ventilation of less than 14 days, 18 years or older and able to provide consent, English speaking, and delirium-free. Exclusion criteria were the presence of delirium or intravenous opioids/sedatives within 24 hours prior to the interview. The quantitative component included simple yes or no questions and identification of quantitative adjectives describing the mechanical ventilation experience. Every 10th patient was invited to participate in an expanded qualitative interview. RESULTS: Data were collected for 12 months with a total sample size of 130 patients participating in the quantitative component and a subset of 15 patients also participating in the qualitative interview. Sixty percent of the total sample consisted of cardiothoracic surgery patients, and 40% were mixed intensive care unit patient populations. Descriptive statistics include the following averaged values: Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores -1.7 throughout mechanical ventilation, aged 59.9 years, days mechanically ventilated 1.4, intensive care unit length of stay 4.6 days, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 16.1. The most significant finding was that 56.2% of patients who could not communicate reported feeling afraid, whereas 32.5% of those who could communicate reported feeling afraid (P < .027). The themes identified in the qualitative component of the study reinforced these quantitative findings; 10 of the 15 patients interviewed reported experiencing fear, and all of the patients reported issues with communication. DISCUSSION: The clinical implications of this research study primarily affect critical care nursing. Changes in nursing practice can address these findings to improve and more effectively acknowledge the patient experience.",0
117,"BACKGROUND: Physical restraints are frequently used for intensive care patients and are associated with substantial morbidity. The effects of common evidence-based critical care interventions on use of physical restraints remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To identify independent predictors of new-onset use of physical restraints in critically ill adults. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study involving 5 adult intensive care units in a tertiary care medical center in the United States. Use of physical restraints was determined via daily in-person assessments and medical record review. Mixed-effects logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with new-onset use of physical restraints, adjusting for covariates and within-subject correlation among intensive care unit days. RESULTS: Of 145 patients who were free of physical restraints within 48 hours of intensive care unit admission, 24 (16.6%) had restraints newly applied during their stay. In adjusted models, delirium (odds ratio [OR], 5.09; 95% CI, 1.83-14.14), endotracheal tube presence (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.22-9.86), and benzodiazepine administration (OR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.28-7.81) significantly increased the odds of next-day use of physical restraints. Tracheostomy was associated with significantly lowered odds of next-day restraint use (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.73). Compared with patients with a target sedation level, patients who were in a coma (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 0.80-8.18) or deeply sedated (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 0.91-7.08) had higher odds of next-day use of physical restraints, and agitated patients (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.00-2.07) were less likely to experience restraint use. CONCLUSION: Several potentially modifiable risk factors are associated with next-day use of physical restraints.",0
118,"BACKGROUND: As delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is a serious problem that can result in increased mortality and morbidity, routine delirium assessment of all ICU patients is recommended. The severity, duration and outcome of the syndrome are directly related to nurses' continuous assessment of patients for signs and symptoms of delirium. However, studies indicate that very few nurses monitor for delirium as a part of their daily practices. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify current practices and perceptions of intensive care nurses regarding delirium assessment and to examine the factors that affect these practices and perceptions. DESIGN: A descriptive, correlational study design was used. METHODS: Data were collected from five Turkish public hospitals using a structured survey questionnaire. The study sample comprised 301 nurses who agreed to participate. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: More than half of the nurses performed delirium assessments. However, the proportion of nurses who use delirium assessment tools was quite low. Almost all of the nurses perceived delirium as a problem and serious problem for ICU patients. The patient group least monitored for delirium was that of unconscious patients. Statistically significant differences were found in the proportion of nurses who assessed delirium symptoms and whose care delivery system was patient-centred and perceived delirium as a serious problem. CONCLUSION: While a majority of ICU nurses perceived delirium as a problem and serious problem, the proportion of those who perform routine delirium assessments was less. It was found that delirium assessment practices of nurses were affected from their perceptions of delirium and the implementation of patient-centred care delivery. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is essential to develop strategies to encourage ICU nurses to perform delirium assessments through the use of delirium assessment tools.",0
119,"Delirium is characterized by transient behavioral manifestations of acute brain disturbances. Delirium in the intensive care unit has been well researched and documented in the adult population. Pediatric delirium research has lagged, but recent developments in screening tools have shed light on the prevalence of delirium among children. The overall prevalence of delirium in the pediatric intensive care unit is 25%. A recent study showed a prevalence of 49% in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit; this higher prevalence may be due to factors related to critical illness and the postoperative environment. This article is intended to increase awareness of delirium in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit and give nurses the tools to identify it and intervene when necessary. A definition of delirium is provided, and its prevalence, risk factors, and current knowledge are reviewed. Available screening tools and environmental and pharmacological interventions are explored.",0
120,"AIM: To develop an education and training programme to enhance bedside nurses' knowledge, competency and compliance in accurately performing delirium screening in intensive care units. BACKGROUND: Delirium in intensive care units is associated with several poor patient outcomes. Delirium detection can be improved by enhancing nurses' knowledge, competency and compliance in accurately performing delirium screening. METHODS: A descriptive quantitative study with pretest-post-test design was adopted. There were 245 nurses from five intensive care units who participated in the study. Multiple-choice questions were used to assess nurses' knowledge change before and after the education programme. Competency was assessed before and 2 months after the programme by simulation with a standardized patient, followed by real patients at the bedside. Compliance data on screening were collected from the documentation of the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU before and 3 and 10 months after the programme. Data collection took 1 year, from June 2014 to May 2015. RESULTS: Despite nurses' improved knowledge and good competency, delirium screening documentations after 3 months were poor. However, screening documentations subsequently improved when measured at 10 months, following further emphasis by the senior nursing staff. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE AND POLICY: Nursing administrators and bedside nurses need to be involved in the policy-making process and plan a training programme for the new nursing staff in the high-risk areas. A short refreshment course should be offered to the nursing staff 3 months after the initial training programme. CONCLUSIONS: Improved knowledge and competency in assessment did not improve compliance and documentation of delirium screening. Therefore, it is important to reinforce nurses' compliance of delirium screening over time.",0
121,"Delirium is a frequent complication of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, manifesting as acute confusion with inattention and disordered thinking. Patients in the ICU who develop acute delirium are more likely to experience long-term disability and mortality. The Society of Critical Care Medicine published guidelines for the management of pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD) in the ICU in 2013. Based on these PAD guidelines, the ABCDEF bundle was created. Research is lacking on how adherence to the ABCDEF bundle elements impacts specific populations such as trauma patients. This represents a significant gap for patients whose multisystem injuries and comorbidities add a higher level of complexity to their care and outcomes. The medical ICU at a large community hospital participated in a 2-year quality improvement project as part of the Society of Critical Care Medicine's ICU Liberation Collaborative. However the organization's trauma ICU (TICU) was excluded from the study. The purpose of this study was to conduct a baseline assessment of trauma patient records to determine which bundle elements were already being applied in the TICU, and if the resources required for implementing the full ABCDEF bundle would be beneficial to the TICU patient outcomes. Benchmark data from the organization's participation in the ICU Liberation Collaborative quality improvement project served as the primary source of evidence. Analysis revealed strengths and opportunities for improvement. Incidence of delirium remained unchanged and far below national averages, indicating the need for further investigation into practices to verify this finding. An opportunity was identified to expand implementation of certain elements of the ABCDEF bundle in the trauma ICU. There is an opportunity for nurses to take the lead in improving patient outcomes. With improved education, evidence-based assessment tools, and best practice guidelines, nurses can help decrease the incidence of delirium by as much as 30%.",0
122,"AIMS: To evaluate the effects of a simulation-based education programme on critical care nurses' knowledge, confidence, competence and clinical performance in providing delirium care. DESIGN: Single-blinded randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Registered nurses who work in intensive care units were recruited from a university-affiliated acute major metropolitan teaching hospital. The intervention group received: (i) five online-learning delirium care videos, (ii) one face-to-face delirium care education session and (iii) a simulation-based education programme with a role-play scenario-based initiative and an objective structured clinical examination. The control group received only online videos which were the same as those provided to the intervention group. Delirium care knowledge, confidence, competence, and clinical performance as outcomes were collected at: baseline, immediately after intervention, and within 6 weeks post-intervention to test whether there were any changes and if they were sustained over time. Data were collected between 2 October and 29 December 2020. The repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine for changes in delirium care knowledge, confidence, and competence within groups. RESULTS: Seventy-two critical care nurses participated with 36 each allocated to the intervention group and control group. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in outcome variables at 6 weeks post-intervention. In the intervention group, significant within-group changes were observed in terms of delirium care knowledge, confidence, and competence over time. By contrast, no significant changes were observed in outcome measures over time in the control group. CONCLUSION: The simulation-based education programme is an effective and feasible strategy to improve delirium care by enhancing the knowledge, confidence, competence and clinical performance of critical care nurses. IMPACT: Our findings provide evidence regarding the development and implementation of a simulation-based education programme in hospitals for health professional education in Taiwan.",0
123,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric delirium is common, associated with negative patient outcomes, and infrequently assessed in the ICU. Locally, pediatric delirium assessments in the cardiac PICU were infrequently documented resulting in an initiative to increase assessment documentation and implement a nurse-driven management protocol, the Bundle to Eliminate Delirium (BED). METHODS: This was a nurse-driven, quality improvement project in an eleven-bed cardiac PICU at a large academic health care facility. A pre- and postimplementation survey evaluating delirium management perceptions, knowledge, and assessment barriers was emailed to 113 nurses. Nurses received education about general delirium principles and assessment followed by weekly emails that included delirium assessment documentation rates and targeted education. Subsequently, BED education was provided via email followed by BED implementation, inclusion of BED completion rates in weekly emails, and observational audits of BED implementation. FINDINGS: 1522 delirium assessment opportunities were evaluated. Assessment documentation increased by 33%. Nurses reported greater confidence in their ability to manage delirium (P < .05 for numerous aspects of delirium care) and were less likely to report 'positive delirium assessments not acted upon' as a barrier to delirium assessment. BED implementation was inconsistent. DISCUSSION: Nursing education and feedback can increase delirium assessment rates and confidence in management but the impact of BED on these outcomes is not clear. APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: Improvement in pediatric delirium care may be obtained through a nurse-driven quality improvement project but an interprofessional approach is needed for optimal management. More studies are needed to identify effective pediatric delirium management strategies such as the BED.",0
124,"PURPOSE: While studies report on perceptions of family participation in delirium prevention, little is known about the use of family-administered delirium detection tools in the care of critically ill patients. This study sought the perspectives of patients, their family members, and healthcare providers on the use of family-administered delirium detection tools to detect delirium in critically ill patients and barriers and facilitators to using family-administered delirium detection tools in patient care. METHODS: In this qualitative study, critical care providers (five physicians, six registered nurses) and participants from the Family ICU Delirium Detection Study (seven past patients and family members) took part in four focus groups at one hospital in Calgary, Alberta. RESULTS: Key themes identified following thematic analysis from 18 participants included: 1) perceptions of acceptability of family-administered delirium detection (e.g., family feels valued, intensive care unit (ICU) care team may not use a family member's results, intensification of work load), 2) considerations regarding feasibility (e.g., insufficient knowledge, healthcare team buy-in), and 3) overarching strategies to support implementation into routine patient care (e.g., value of family-administered delirium detection for patients and families is well understood in the clinical context, regular communication between the family and ICU providers, an electronic version of the tool). CONCLUSIONS: Patients, family members and healthcare providers who participated in the focus groups perceived family participation in delirium detection and the use of family-administered delirium detection tools at the bedside as feasible and of value to patient care and family member coping.

125,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common syndrome that has both short and long-term negative outcomes for critically ill patients. Many studies over several years have found a knowledge gap and lack of evidence-based practice from critical care personnel, but there has been little exploration of the reasons for this. AIM: To identify the perceived barriers to delirium assessment and management among critical care nurses. METHOD: A literature review of published studies to examine barriers to effective delirium assessment using a comprehensive search strategy. Five relevant studies identified for review. RESULTS: Few studies have investigated barriers to delirium assessment and management, but several themes reoccur throughout the literature. The perceived time consuming nature of the assessment tools is cited by many, as is the lack of medical prioritisation of results. Lack of education on delirium appears to be a significant factor and reinforces some of the stated misconceptions. CONCLUSION: Many barriers exist to prevent effective assessment and management of delirium, but several of these are due to a lack of understanding or unfamiliarity with the condition and the assessment tools as well as lack of medical prioritisation of the results. Further research is needed on this topic.",0
126,"BACKGROUND: Delirium evaluation is important because the development of delirium in critically ill patients negatively affects their progress and prognosis. Although delirium assessment tools have been developed, nurses have insufficient experience using these tools in clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of case-based confusion assessment methods for intensive care unit education on delirium knowledge and assessment accuracy for intensive care nurses. DESIGN: This study adopted a pre- and post-test non-equivalent control group design. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: The study participants were 122 general nurses (61 participants each in the experimental and control groups) working in the intensive care unit of one university hospital in South Korea. METHODS: Case-based confusion assessment methods for intensive care unit education comprised lectures on delirium and confusion assessment methods for intensive care unit tools and delirium assessment education using standardized patients. The experimental group received 80-min case-based confusion assessment methods for intensive care unit training, whereas the control group received no intervention. RESULTS: Differences in the degree of pre- and post-knowledge in subcategories between the experimental and control groups were the cause, symptom, and management. The delirium assessment accuracy score of the experimental group changed from 2.89 ± 1.61 points before training to 8.11 ± 1.23 points after training, whereas that of the control group changed from 2.92 ± 1.94 points before training to 3.05 ± 2.99 points after training (Z = -9.668, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The case-based confusion assessment methods for intensive care unit educational program developed in this study is effective for improving delirium knowledge and delirium assessment accuracy in intensive care nurses. Based on the study results, various cases can be developed for the education of intensive care nurses.",0
127,"The 2013 American College of Critical Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for the management of pain, agitation, and delirium in adult patients in the intensive care unit serves as a living example of nurses' involvement in the development and implementation of professional guidelines.

Specific examples from the pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines for care are used to explore the roles of the nurse leader, nurse informaticist, staff nurse, and nurse researcher in relationship to guideline implementation.",0
128,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication in critical care. The syndrome is often underestimated due to its potentially no less dangerous course as a hypoactive delirium. Therefore, current guidelines ask for a structured, regular and routine screening in all intensive care units. If delirium is diagnosed, symptomatic therapy should be initiated promptly. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to evaluate recent German anesthetists' strategies regarding delirium care compared to the German guidelines for sedation and delirium in intensive care. METHODS: In an online survey German hospitals' senior anesthetists (n = 922) were interviewed anonymously between May and June 2015 regarding guideline use in delirium management in German intensive care units. In 33 direct questions the anesthetists were invited to answer items regarding the structure of their hospitals, intensive care and delirium therapy in order to review their knowledge of the German delirium guidelines that expired in 2014. RESULTS: The 249 senior anesthetists who responded to the survey, can be associated with (or represent) a quarter of German intensive care beds and cases, respectively. In every tenth clinic that runs an intensive care unit the guideline was unknown. In three of four intensive care units physicians specified a preferred delirium score, the CAM-ICU (49.4 %) is used most frequently. With knowledge of the guidelines more often a recommended delirium score is used (p = 0.017). However, only 53.6 % of the respondents ascertain a score every eight hours and 36 % have no facility for standardized documentation in the records. At intensive care rounds, a possible diagnosis of delirium is an inherent part in only 34.9 % of the responders even with guideline knowledge. The particular gold standard for the therapy of delirium (alphaagonists for vegetative symptoms; 89.6 %, benzodiazepines for anxiety, 77.5 %; antipsychotics in 86.7 % for psychotic symptoms) is implemented more often with growing knowledge of the guidelines. The latter applies to the implementation of structured programs for delirium prophylaxis, cognition and therapy. CONCLUSION: For the first time, this study documents knowledge and implementation of the German S3 guidelines for delirium in intensive care. Overall, the guidelines for delirium care are less well executed than those for sedation. With growing knowledge of the guidelines, diagnosis and treatment of delirium fits the guidelines more frequently. The facility to document a delirium score in intensive records is insufficient. Especially a nursing-based delirium strategy could possibly improve implementation of the guidelines, claiming an eight-hour screening and documentation. However, the small number of hospitals that have integrated the guidelines into in-house standard operating procedures (40 %) shows urgent need for optimization. A re-evaluation involving all relevant caretakers could probably improve the implementation of guidelines in intensive care and perioperative medicine.",0
129,"Critical care nurses work in challenging environments that are often sterile, impersonal, noisy, and frightening to patients and their families. Nurses act as liaisons between medical professionals and patients and their families in multiple specialty intensive care units. Critical care nursing practice, guided by the American Nurses Association Code of Ethics, respects patients' religious, spiritual, and cultural beliefs, contributing to holistic care delivery. Therapeutic psychosocial outcomes of holistic care delivery and patient advocacy are explored. Personalized psychosocial care through treating patients holistically will support and maintain positive psychosocial outcomes in intensive care units across the country.",0
130,"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines suggest that routine assessment, treatment, and prevention of pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD) is essential to improving patient outcomes as delirium is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Despite the well-established improvements on patient outcomes, adherence to PAD guidelines is poor in community intensive care units (ICU). This quality improvement (QI) project aims to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted and multidisciplinary intervention on PAD management in a Canadian community ICU and to describe the experience of a Canadian community hospital in conducting a QI project. METHODS: A ten-member PAD advisory committee was formed to develop and implement the intervention. The intervention consisted of a multidisciplinary rounds script, poster, interviews, visual reminders, educational modules, pamphlet and video. The 4-week intervention targeted nurses, family members, physicians, and the multidisciplinary team. An uncontrolled, before-and-after study methodology was used. Adherence to PAD assessment guidelines by nurses was measured over a 6-week pre-intervention and over a 6-week post-intervention periods. RESULTS: Data on 430 and 406 patient-days (PD) were available for analysis during the pre- and post- intervention periods, respectively. The intervention did not improve the proportion of PD with guideline compliance to the assessment of pain (23.4% vs. 22.4%, p=0.80), agitation (42.9% vs. 38.9%, p=0.28), nor delirium (35.2% vs. 29.6%, p=0.10) by nurses. DISCUSSION: The implementation of a multifaceted and multidisciplinary intervention on PAD assessment did not result in significant improvements in guideline adherence in a community ICU. Barriers to knowledge translation are apparent at multiple levels including the personal level (low completion rates on educational modules), interventional level (under-collection of data), and organisational level (coinciding with hospital accreditation education). Our next steps include reintroduction of education modules using organisation approved platforms, updating existing ICU policy, updating admission order sets, and conducting audit and feedback.",0
131,"Nurses caring for critically ill adults are challenged to balance patient comfort with the risk of complications associated with analgesic therapy. Evidence gathered since 2013, when the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) published the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Pain, Agitation, and Delirium in Adult Patients in the Intensive Care Unit, known as the PAD guidelines, gave rise to the SCCM 2018 publication of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU, known as the PADIS guidelines. This article discusses how the PADIS guidelines go beyond the PAD guidelines, providing specific guidance related to risk factors for pain, the assessment and management of pain in critical illness, and the ways in which the experience of pain in critical illness is intertwined with that of agitation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption. Tables summarize the key points in the PADIS guidelines, clarify the distinctions between PADIS and PAD, and describe the implications for nurses.",0
132,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common, underdetected problem that has short- and long-term negative sequelae for critically ill patients. Prompt and accurate delirium identification by nurses can ensure early intervention and treatment to help minimize adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between an educational program and the accuracy of registered nurses' (RNs') documentation of the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), a delirium screening tool. METHODS: In a medical ICU at a tertiary academic medical center from September 2015 to March 2016, RNs were reinstructed on use of the CAM-ICU. Registered nurse assessment data were collected retrospectively for 12 months before and after intervention and were compared against the CAM-ICU algorithm using χ analysis. RESULTS: A total of 10 736 RN assessments in 1020 patients preintervention and 11 068 in 951 patients postintervention were evaluated. Overall RN accuracy improved from 78% to 80% (P = .054). The algorithm determined delirium to be present in 32% versus 30% of all patients preintervention and postintervention, respectively; there was no difference in rate of nurse detection of delirium preintervention and postintervention (54% vs 55%, not statistically significant). The percentage of ""inappropriate unable to assess"" ratings by nurses decreased from 42% to 37% postintervention (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: After a comprehensive training initiative, there was no significant improvement in CAM-ICU documentation and no improvements in patient delirium identification. Future quality improvement efforts should target reducing the number of assessments that RNs judge to be ""unable to assess."" Clinical practice must evolve to routinely incorporate RN delirium assessments into the patient's plan of care.",0
133,"INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a fluctuating cognitive disorder that occurs in admitted patients, especially in patients who are in intensive care units. Nurses due to persistent contact with patients and direct observation of their mental changes play an essential role in delirium evaluation. Early detection of delirium, identification of risk factors, and its prevention methods are critical to reducing complications, mortality, and treatment costs. This study aimed to determine the perception and the practices of nurses in intensive care units to assess delirium and its barriers. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All nurses working in the intensive care unit (neurology, trauma, surgery, general, and heart) of educational hospitals in Kerman, Iran, were the study population. The data gathering tool was a questionnaire consisting of four sections: demographic information, nurses' perception, practices, and perceived barriers in delirium assessment. RESULTS: The total score of nurses' perception in delirium assessment was 19.47 ± 3.36, which was higher than the medium score of the questionnaire (estimated score = 16). In all, 45.5% of nurses reported having delirium treatment protocol in their units, and 12.1% of the nurses considered delirium as a priority of evaluating the patient's condition. The most important barrier to delirium assessment was the difficulty of assessing delirium in intubated patients. There was no association between nurses' perception and practices (p value > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Designing and implementing educational programs for improving nurses' practices in this field is necessary. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Healthcare providers, especially nurses, should be aware of the delirium assessment of the ICU patients to provide better care.

134,"Delirium is a common complication of critical illness. As frontline providers, nurses (registered nurses) are uniquely positioned to inform interventions to improve intensive care unit (ICU) patient outcomes. This article reports a study of attitudes and knowledge about ICU delirium assessment at an urban academic medical center. Findings suggest a knowledge deficit regarding the spectrum of delirium. ICU nurses also identified that a lack of effective collaboration within the treatment team was the biggest barrier to effective care for the patient with hypoactive delirium. The study findings indicate that both educational and management initiatives are needed to improve clinical practices for patients with manifestations of hypoactive and hyperactive delirium.",0
135,"The global population is aging and intensive care unit admission rate of elderly patients is dramatically increasing. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the literature about the management of elderly patients in intensive care unit and more specifically about epidemiology, admission criteria, mortality, functional prognosis and ethical aspects. We also discuss the data on cardiorespiratory arrest, shock, acute respiratory failure and delirium. The mortality rate of patients over 80 years old in intensive care unit can reach up to 70% at 1year, but is dependent on many factors, such as comorbidities or frailty. Above all, more than half of elderly patients recover their long-term autonomy. Their quality of life is comparable to that of the same age population. Considering that the first 3months after an intensive care unit stay are the most decisive in terms of vital and functional prognosis, we will discuss strategies to improve care through the creation of dedicated intensive care-geriatrics networks.",0
136,"PURPOSE: To characterize monitoring of pain, agitation, and delirium; investigate opioid and sedative choices; and describe prevention and treatment of delirium in adults receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) for respiratory failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: International, cross-sectional survey distributed January 2018 to members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. RESULTS: Respondents were predominately physicians (58%) from North America (89%). Fentanyl (77%) and hydromorphone (48%) were the most common intravenous opioids used to manage pain. A deep level of sedation was targeted in the first 24-h after initiation of vv-ECMO 64% of the time. When deep sedation was targeted, propofol (70%) and benzodiazepines (41%) were the most common sedatives. The most common sedatives for light sedation were dexmedetomidine (45%) and propofol (39%). Delirium prevention included avoidance of benzodiazepines (73%), whereas the most common treatment strategy was scheduled atypical antipsychotics (83%). Centers that extubated patients during vv-ECMO used dexmedetomidine as the second preferred sedative as compared to benzodiazepines at non-extubating centers (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Most respondents use validated scales and protocols to assess and manage pain, agitation/sedation, and delirium. The majority of respondents reported targeting a deep level of sedation with propofol being used for both deep and light levels of sedation.",0
137,"BACKGROUND: Delirium poses increased morbidity and mortality risks for hospitalized patients. Underrecognition by health care providers contributes to poor outcomes for patients. Little has been published about methods used to teach health care providers how to screen for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal educational intervention for nurses in the medical intensive care unit to improve their knowledge and skills regarding delirium and delirium recognition. METHODS: An educational intervention was done in the medical intensive care unit of an academic medical center. Effectiveness was evaluated via a quasi-experimental design and using preintervention and postintervention assessments. Procedural correctness of performing the CAM-ICU delirium screening also was measured. RESULTS: Nurses participated in 1 small-group session (n = 34). Fifteen sessions were conducted from June to September 2016, and assessments were completed before and after the intervention. The sample consisted of predominantly nurses with a bachelor's degree (56%) who had 1 to 5 years' experience (59%). Mean scores overall and on the knowledge subscale differed significantly (P < .001) from before to after the intervention. No correlation was found between demographic groups and score differences. Seventy-nine percent of participants used the tool correctly after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The educational intervention provided for these nurses further validated published reports of the benefits of an educational program about delirium. The content of the educational intervention should be targeted for the setting, the risk factors for the patient population in question, and the specific delirium screening tool used.",0
138,"Bjorn Ibsen, an anesthetist who pioneered positive pressure ventilation as a treatment option during the Copenhagen polio epidemic of 1952, set up the first Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Europe in 1953. He managed polio patients on positive pressure ventilation together with physicians and physiologists in a dedicated ward, where one nurse was assigned to each patient. In that sense Ibsen is more or less the father of intensive care medicine as a specialty and also an advocate of the one-to-one nursing ratio for critically ill patients. Nowadays, the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) offers critical care treatment to unstable, severely, or potentially severely ill patients in the perioperative setting, who have life-threatening conditions and require comprehensive care, constant monitoring, and possible emergency interventions. Hence there is one very specific challenge in the surgical setting: the intensivist has to manage the patient flow starting from admission to the hospital through to the operating theater, in the SICU, and postoperatively for the discharge to the ward. In other words, the planning of the resources (most frequently availability of beds) has to be optimized to prevent cancellations of elective surgical procedures but also to facilitate other emergency admissions. SICU intensivists take the role of arbitrators between surgical demand and patient's interests. This means they supervise the safety, efficacy, and workability of the process with respect to all stakeholders. This notion was reported in 2007 when Stawicki and co-workers performed a small prospective study concluding that it appears safe if the dedicated intensivist takes over the role of the last arbitrator supported by a multidisciplinary team.1 However, demographic changes in many countries during the last few decades have given rise to populations which are more elderly and sicker than before. This impacts on the healthcare system in general but on the intensivist and the ICU team too. In addition, in a society with an increased life expectancy, the balance between treatable disease, outcome, and utilization of resources must be maintained. This fact gains even more importance as patients and their families claim ""high end"" treatment. Such a demand is reflected looking at the developments that have taken place over the last 25 years. Mainly, the focus of intensive care medicine was on technical support or even replacement of failing organ systems such as the lungs, the heart, or the kidneys by veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO), veno-arterial ECMO (VA-ECMO), and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) respectively. This means ""technical care"" became a core capability and expectation of critical care medicine. In parallel, medical treatment became more standardized. For example, lung protective ventilation strategies, early enteral feeding, and daily sedation vacation are part of modern protocols. As a consequence, ventilator time has been reduced and patients therefore develop delirium less frequently. These measures, beside others, are implemented in care bundles to improve the quality of care of patients by the whole ICU team. The importance of specialty trained teams was already pointed out 35 years ago when Li et al.,2 demonstrated in a study performed in a community hospital that the mortality was decreased if an ICU was managed 24/7 by an on-site physician. The association of improved outcomes and presence of a critical care trained physician (intensivist) has been shown in several studies since that time.3,4,5,6 A modern multidisciplinary critical care team consists at least of an intensivist, ICU nurse, pharmacist, respiratory therapist, physiotherapist, and the primary team physician. Based on clinical needs, the team can be supplemented by oncologists, cardiologists, or other specialties. Again, this approach is supported by research: a recent retrospective cohort study from the California Hospital Assessment and Reporting Taskforce (CHART) on 60,330 patients confirmed the association between improved patient outcome and such a multidisciplinary team.7 If such an intensive care team makes a difference, why do not all patients at risk receive advanced ICU-care? It was already demonstrated by Esteban et al., in a prospective study that patients with severe sepsis had a mortality rate of 26% when not admitted to an ICU in comparison to 11% when they were admitted to an ICU.8 Meanwhile, we know that early referral is particularly important, because for ischemic diseases the timing appears to make a difference in terms of full recovery. So, the following questions arise: Should intensive care be rolled out to each ward and physical admission to an ICU or be restricted to special cases only? For this purpose, the so-called ""Rapid Response Teams"" (RRT) or ""Medical Emergency Team"" (MET), which essentially are a form of an ICU outreach team, were implemented. The name, composition, or exact role of such team varies from institution to institution and country to country. Alternatively, should all ward staff be educated to recognize sick patients earlier for a timely transfer to a dedicated area? This would mean that ICU-care would be introduced in the ward. A first attempt to answer this question, whether to deploy critical care resources to deteriorating patients outside the ICU 24/7, was given by Churpek et al.9 The success of the rapid response teams could be related to decreased rates of cardiac arrest outside the ICU setting and in-hospital mortality. Interestingly, an analysis of the registry database of the RRT calls in this study showed that the lowest frequency of calls occurred between 1:00 AM to 6:59 AM time period. In contrast, the mortality was highest around 7 AM and lowest during noon hour. This indicates that not simply the availability of such a team makes a difference but also the alertness of the ward-teams is of high importance to identify deteriorating patients in a timely manner. Essentially, this would necessitate ward staff being trained to provide a higher level of care enabling them to better recognize when patients become sicker to avoid a delayed call to the ICU. Alternatively, a system in which the intensivist plays a major role in daily ward rounds could be beneficial. So, the ward doctor should become an intensivist. However, the latter means the ICU is rolled out across the whole hospital which would consume a huge amount of resources. Another option would be 24/7 remote monitoring of patients at risk that notifies the intensivist or RRT in case of need. The infrastructure, technology, and manpower to put this in place also has associated costs. As the demand for ICU care will rise further in the future, intensivists will play an even more important role in the healthcare system that itself is under enormous economic pressure to ensure the best quality of care for critically ill patients. Besides excellent knowledge and hard skills, intensivists need to be team players, communicators, facilitators, and arbitrators to achieve the best results in collaboration with all involved in patient treatment.",0
139,"A common requirement for intubated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is sedation and pain management to facilitate patient safety and timely, atraumatic healing. The Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines for management of pain, sedation, and delirium in adult ICU patients provide assessment scales for pain, sedation, and delirium; medications for sedation and pain management, and protocols for weaning sedation, are discussed. Proficient assessment skills, pharmacologic knowledge of medications administered to provide sedation, and an understanding of the importance of nonpharmacologic interventions can help the registered nurse provide patient advocacy, safety, and improved outcomes.",0
140,"Background: Chaplain-led communication-board-guided spiritual care may reduce anxiety and stress during an intensive care unit (ICU) admission for nonvocal mechanically ventilated patients, but clinical pastoral education does not teach the assistive communication skills needed to provide communication-board-guided spiritual care. Objective: To evaluate a four-hour chaplain-led seminar to educate chaplains about ICU patients' psychoemotional distress, and train them in assistive communication skills for providing chaplain-led communication-board-guided spiritual care. Design: A survey immediately before and after the seminar, and one-year follow-up about use of communication-board-guided spiritual care. Subjects/Setting: Sixty-two chaplains from four U.S. medical centers. Measurements: Multiple-choice and 10-point integer scale questions about ICU patients' mental health and communication-board-guided spiritual care best practices. Results: Chaplain awareness of ICU sedation practices, signs of delirium, and depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder in ICU survivors increased significantly (all p < 0.001). Knowledge about using tagged yes/no questions to communicate with nonvocal patients increased from 38% to 87%, p < 0.001. Self-reported skill and comfort in providing communication-board-guided spiritual care increased from a median (interquartile range) score of 4 (2-6) to 7 (5-8) and 6 (4-8) to 8 (6-9), respectively (both p < 0.001). One year later, 31% of chaplains reported providing communication-board-guided spiritual care in the ICU. Conclusions: A single chaplain-led seminar taught chaplains about ICU patients' psychoemotional distress, trained chaplains in assistive communication skills with nonvocal patients, and led to the use of communication-board-guided spiritual care in the ICU for up to one year later.",0
141,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the medical community's awareness and practice regarding delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: One hundred and ten predesigned questionnaires were distributed to ICU practitioners in the affiliated hospitals of Zhejiang University. RESULTS: A total of 105 valid questionnaires were collected. Totally, 55.3% of the clinicians considered that delirium was common in the ICU. Delirium was believed to be a significant or serious problem by 70.5% of respondents, and under-diagnosis was acknowledged by 56.2% of the respondents. The incidence of ICU delirium is even more under-estimated by the pediatric doctors compared with their counterparts in adult ICU (P less than 0.05). Primary disease of the brain (agreed by 82.1% of the respondents) was believed to be the most common risk factor for delirium. None of the ICU professionals screened delirium or used a specific tool for delirium assessment routinely. The vast majority (92.4%) of respondents had little knowledge on the diagnosis and the standard treatment of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Although delirium is considered as a serious problem by a majority of the surveyed ICU professionals, it is still under-recognized in routine critical care practice. Data from this survey show a disconnection between the perceived significance of delirium and the current practices of monitoring and treatment in ICU in China.",0
142,"BACKGROUND: Delirium remains significantly undetected in the intensive care unit (ICU). Little is known regarding the level of delirium care knowledge among critical care nurses in Taiwan. PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate the level of knowledge about delirium care among critical care nurses using a multiple-choice question quiz. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional approach was used, and data were collected using a web-based survey. The demographic characteristics including age, years worked as critical care nurse, gender, advanced ICU training, educational level, and type of ICU, along with a delirium care knowledge quiz, were collected. The quiz consisted of 16 items measuring (a) symptoms, types, and outcomes; (b) high-risk groups; (c) predisposing and precipitating factors; and (d) assessment and detection of delirium. Data were collected between October 6 and November 16, 2020. RESULTS: In total, 324 critical care nurses completed the survey. The rate of correct response on the delirium care quiz for each domain was measured: (a) symptoms, types, and outcomes: 67.1%; (b) high-risk groups: 76.2%; (c) predisposing and precipitating factors: 78.9%; and (d) assessment and detection: 41.5%. The item with the lowest correct response rate was related to the interpretation of delirium assessments. CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of this study suggest that future studies and education should focus on the use and interpretation of the assessment using a valid delirium assessment tool to improve the ability of critical care nurses to detect delirium in ICU settings.",0
143,"The prevalence of delirium in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is reported to vary from 20 to 80 %. Delirium in the ICU is not only a frightening experience for the patient and his or her family, it is also a challenge for the nurses and physicians taking care of the patient. Furthermore, it is also associated with worse outcome, prolonged hospitalisation, increased costs, long-term cognitive impairment and higher mortality rates. Thus, strategies to prevent ICU-delirium in addition to the early diagnosis and treatment of delirium are important. The pathophysiology of delirium is still incompletely understood, but numerous risk factors for the development of delirium have been identified in ICU-patients, among which are potentially modifiable factors such as metabolic disturbances, hypotension, anaemia, fever and infection. Key factors are the prevention and management of common risk factors, including avoiding overzealous sedation and analgesia and creating an environment that enhances reintegration. Once delirium is diagnosed, treatment consists of the use of typical and atypical antipsychotics. Haloperidol is still the drug of choice for the treatment of delirium and can be given intravenously in incremental doses of 1 to 2 to 5 (to 10) mg every 15 - 20 minutes.",0
144,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to compare nurse-led sedation protocols with physician-led usual care in intensive care units (ICUs) in treating mechanically ventilated adult patients. REVIEW METHOD USED: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and China Wanfang databases were interrogated for articles published before May 2020. REVIEW METHOD: As per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and six preintervention and postintervention studies published in English and Chinese met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Two reviewers independently extracted data into a tabular format using predefined data fields. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The quality of the included RCTs and preintervention and postintervention studies was assessed using the Cochrane Quality Assessment Tool and Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions assessment tool. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were of intermediate methodological quality, and six preintervention and postintervention studies exhibited a low to moderate risk of bias. Compared with usual care, nurse-led sedation protocols resulted in significantly decreased durations of mechanical ventilation (days) (standardised mean difference = -1.765; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -2.461, -1.068); P < 0.001; I2 = 97.7%); decreased length of ICU stay (days) (standardised mean difference = -1.463; 95% CI = -2.181, -0.745; P < 0.001; I2 = 97.3%); reduced ICU mortality (relative risk [RR] = 0.854; 95% CI = 0.747, 0.983; P = 0.027), I2 = 0%); and decreased incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR = 0.438; 95% CI = 0.292, 0.657; P < 0.001; I2 = 41.4%), delirium (RR = 0.522; 95% CI = 0.338, 0.807; P = 0.003; I2 = 26.6%), and extubation failure (RR = 0.498; 95% CI = 0.266, 0.932; P = 0.029; I2 = 45.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Although pre-post intervention study design cannot establish causality, the present findings raise the considerable possibility that a sedation protocol can be safely implemented by nurses to reduce mortality in ICUs and sedation-related adverse events in patients on mechanical ventilation compared with physician-led usual care.",0
145,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to appraise current research which examines the impact of early rehabilitation practices on functional outcomes and quality of life in adult intensive care unit (ICU) survivors. REVIEW METHOD USED: A systematic literature search was undertaken; retrieved data was evaluated against a recognised evaluation tool; research findings were analysed and categorised into themes; and a synthesis of conclusions from each theme was presented as an integrated summation of the topic. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases of PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Ovid Medline and Google Scholar were searched using key search terms 'ICU acquired weakness', 'early rehabilitation' 'early mobility' and 'functional outcomes' combined with 'intensive care' and 'critical illness'. Additional literature was sourced from reference lists of relevant original publications. RESULTS: Five major themes related to the review objectives emerged from the analysis. These themes included: critically ill patients do not always receive physical therapy as a standard of care; ICU culture and resources determine early rehabilitation success; successful respiratory and physical rehabilitation interventions are tailored according to individual patient impairment; early exercise in the ICU prevents the neuromuscular complications of critical illness and improves functional status; early exercise in the ICU is effective, safe and feasible. CONCLUSIONS: A limited body of research supports early rehabilitation interventions to optimise the short term outcomes and long term quality of life for ICU survivors. Critical care nurses are in an excellent position to drive change within their departments ensuring that early rehabilitation practices are adopted and implemented.",0
146,"This review demonstrates essential issues to consider when caring for older trauma patients, including baseline physical status, mental health, comorbidities, and risk factors for sequelae and future injuries. The impact of a traumatic injury on older adults is complex. Issues of normal aging, functional status, chronic health conditions, and response to treatment affect health care and related decisions. Studies that have examined outcomes for older trauma patients to date have been mainly descriptive or confined to a single institution, limiting our ability to generalize. Other studies, using large data sets, have provided some information regarding possible primary prevention strategies, yet have limitations in the individual level detail collected. Nevertheless, this review also demonstrates the dearth of available evidence-based recommendations that provides support to treatment protocols in this complex and diverse patient population. The lack of an evidence base to use in the management of older trauma patients demonstrates the critical need for research in this rapidly growing population. An example of one such area includes the use of pulmonary artery catheters in older trauma patients. Although evidence to date suggests that pulmonary artery catheters are of benefit in the management of patients with physiologic compromise, it is unclear whether using these published cardiac output management recommendations leads to improved outcomes. In light of newly published data suggesting equivocal benefit from use of pulmonary artery catheters, with increased side effects, this controversy is an important area for future research. Critical care nurses, with their emphasis on multidisciplinary, holistic practice, can expand their influence as essential members of the interdisciplinary team caring for older trauma patients by cultivating geriatric specialty knowledge. Older trauma patients would benefit greatly from this type of specialty nursing care during all phases of the recovery trajectory, particularly in terms of adequate symptom management and prevention of sequelae, as well as with timely and appropriate initiation of consultative services. Using the intersection of primary and secondary prevention as the overall guide for practice, critical care nurses and other health care providers who possess an understanding of aging processes and comorbid conditions can significantly improve outcomes for older adults with traumatic injuries.",0
147,"BACKGROUND: Delirium occurs frequently in the intensive care unit and is associated with detrimental consequences. Cognitive training is a promising, nonpharmacologic, preventive intervention, but it is unknown whether cognitive training is feasible for patients in intensive care units. OBJECTIVES: To examine the feasibility for both nurses and patients of using cognitive training exercises for intensive care unit patients. METHODS: A pilot study of a set of cognitive training exercises in a large, academic intensive care unit. Feasibility of the exercises, operationalized as practicability and burden for the patient and the nurse, was tested in multiple rounds and evaluated using Likert scales and open-ended questions, patients' vital signs, and time investment. RESULTS: In total, 75 patients were included. During the first round, 11 exercises were separately tested by nursing researchers in 44 cooperative patients (50% with delirium). Four exercises were evaluated as burdensome and were excluded. Vital signs did not alter during execution. In a second round, the remaining exercises were tested in 31 patients (52% with delirium) by their attending nurse. All exercises were rated as practicable and not burdensome by the patients and the nurses. Total time investment per exercise was a median 4.5 (interquartile range, 3.0-5.0) minutes. CONCLUSION: Cognitive training exercises used in this study were feasible for intensive care unit patients (including cooperative patients with delirium) and their nurses. More research is needed to determine the clinical effect of the exercises on delirium outcome.",0
148,"Immobility in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with neuromuscular weakness, post-intensive care syndrome, functional limitations, and high costs. Early mobility-based rehabilitation in the ICU is feasible and safe. Mobility-based rehabilitation varied widely across 5 ICUs in 1 health care system, suggesting a need for continuous training and evaluation to maintain a strong mobility-based rehabilitation program. Early mobility-based rehabilitation shortens ICU and hospital stays, reduces delirium, and increases muscle strength and the ability to ambulate. Long-term effects include increased ability for self-care, faster return to independent functioning, improved physical function, and reduced hospital readmission and death. Factors that influence early mobility-based rehabilitation include having an interdisciplinary team; strong unit leadership; access to physical, occupational, and respiratory therapists; a culture focused on patient safety and quality improvement; a champion of early mobility; and a focus on measuring performance and outcomes.",0
149,"BACKGROUND: The ABCDE interprofessional bundle (Awakening and Breathing Coordination, Delirium monitoring and management, and Early mobility) reduces delirium and weakness in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To understand the relationship between organizational domains and provider attitudes. METHODS: A 1-time electronic survey of 315 care providers in 10 intensive care units across the country to examine associations between organizational domains (policy/protocol factors, unit milieu, tasks, labor quality, labor quantity, and physical environment) and provider attitudes about perceived ease of completion, perceived safety, confidence, and perceived strength of evidence regarding the ABCDE bundle. Spearman correlations (rs) were used to examine the associations between organizational domains and provider attitude subscales (rs ≥ 0.32 was considered clinically important). RESULTS: Protocol attributes (rs = 0.37-0.58), role clarity (rs = 0.38-0.59), training/understanding (rs = 0.33-0.46), coordination (rs = 0.32-0.46), and peer advocates (rs = 0.37-0.48) were associated with less difficulty performing the bundle and better confidence, perceived safety, and strength of evidence. Participants also reported less difficulty carrying out the bundle when the team worked well together. Task autonomy was associated with better perceived safety (rs = 0.35) and confidence (rs = 0.47) related to the bundle. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing interventions on policy and protocol factors, unit milieu, and task autonomy, which have the strongest associations with providers' attitudes, may facilitate ABCDE bundle uptake.",0
150,"BACKGROUND: Patients within the adult intensive care unit have the potential to develop delirium and agitation. This can result in the patient displaying unwanted behaviours such as attempting to remove the medical devices to which they are attached. Some adult intensive care units within the UK are starting to adopt physical restraint as a method of managing unwanted behaviours. AIM: To determine the experiences, attitudes and opinions of adult intensive care nurses in relation to the application of physical restraint. DESIGN: Questionnaire survey. METHODS: A postal questionnaire was distributed to all nurses (n = 192) within two purposefully selected large adult intensive care units in the UK. RESULTS: Data were collected between November 2012 and February 2013. The questionnaire was completed by 38·9% (n = 75) of the nurses contacted. All believed that physical restraint had a place, with the majority of the view that the reason for its application was to maintain patient safety. Some expressed discomfort about the use of physical restraint. Nurses were happy to discuss the use of restraint with families. There was a perceived need for training and support for nursing staff as well as the need for medical staff to support the decision-making process. CONCLUSION: Nurses require more support and evidence to base their decision-making upon. They require guidance from professional bodies as well as support from medical colleagues. The findings have limited generalizability as they can only be applied to the units accessed and the response rate was poor. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Alternative approaches such as pain management, sleep promotion and the involvement of relatives need to be explored before physical restraint policy can be written. Further research is required into the safety of physical restraint, alternative methods of managing the risk of agitation and identifying predisposing factors to accidental device removal.",0
151,"BACKGROUND: Nurses are fundamental to the implementation of sedation protocols for patients receiving mechanical ventilation. A 2005 survey showed that nurses' attitudes toward sedation affected their sedation practices. Since then, updated guidelines on managing pain, agitation, and delirium have been published. OBJECTIVE: To explore nurses' self-reported attitudes and practices related to sedation and determine whether they have changed in the past decade. METHODS: Members of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses were invited to complete the Nurse Sedation Practices Scale, which measures nurses' self-reported sedation practices and factors that affect them. Item and subscale responses were analyzed, and differences in item responses by respondent characteristics were determined. RESULTS: Respondents (N = 177) were mostly staff nurses (68%) with a bachelor's degree in nursing (63%). Nurses' attitudes toward the effectiveness of sedation in relieving patients' distress during mechanical ventilation correlated positively with their intention to administer sedatives (r s = 0.65). Sixty-six percent of nurses agreed that sedation was necessary for patients' comfort, and 34% agreed that limiting patients' recall was a desired outcome of sedation. Respondents with more experience or CCRN certification had a less positive evaluation of the effectiveness of sedation in minimizing distress. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses' attitudes toward sedating patients receiving mechanical ventilation have shifted in the past decade, with fewer nurses now believing that all patients should be sedated. However, more than half of nurses still agree that sedation is needed for patients' comfort, highlighting the need to consider nurses' attitudes when seeking to optimize sedation practices during mechanical ventilation.",0
152,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the inter-rater reliability and usability of two delirium screening tools designed for use in ICU; the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY/DESIGN: A multiple methods design was used. The intra and inter rater reliability of the tools were evaluated using Kappa statistics and intra class correlation coefficients. Focus groups were conducted to explore ICU staff perceptions of the usability of the tools and feasibility of delirium screening. SETTING: Private hospital ICU, Melbourne Australia. RESULTS: 66 patients were assessed for delirium; median age of 71 (IQR 62-75) years. Seventeen patients (26%) scored positive for delirium using the screening tools and 11 (17%) had delirium confirmed on the medical ICU discharge summary. Ten nurse assessors performed 99 paired assessments using the two tools sequentially, demonstrating the intra and inter-rater agreement and reliability of the tools was moderate to high. Four focus groups were conducted with 16 participants. Content analysis identified three themes: (i) current recognition of delirium, (ii) benefits of delirium screening, and (iii) future directions for delirium management. Time and medical staff indifference were identified as barriers to screening, facilitators were education and having a follow-up plan. CONCLUSION: This study found that the reliability and usability of the CAM-ICU and ICDSC were acceptable and that using structured delirium screening was feasible as part of a wider, multi-disciplinary delirium management plan.",0
153,"Nurses are in an excellent position to positively impact the quality of care for this group of patients. By developing a knowledge base of risk factors with a special emphasis on modifiable risks factors, nurses become pivotal in the development of an client focused plan of care. The value of the plan of care is to target intervention protocols to ameliorate the effect of the hospital environment on the at-risk patient with the goal of decreasing the incidence of delirium. Careful screening and a systematic approach to assessment (using a validated assessment tool) can result in early detection and rapid intervention to treat the modifiable causative factors while continuing to provide supportive pharmacological and nonpharmacological care. A sample care path for hospitalized older patients at-risk for developing delirium is described in Figure 1. Delirium is a common occurrence in the older surgical patient and is a contributing cause of functional disability, morbidity, and mortality. Unfortunately, it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Nurses can improve patients' quality of care and outcomes by implementing interventions targeted at modifiable risk factors and early recognition of delirium. The care of older surgical patients requires a rigorous approach to prevention, detection and management. Close attention to ensure adequate oxygenation, perfusion, hydration, nutrition and stimulation is critical. Commitment to improve outcomes in a decidedly vulnerable patient population holds the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality as well as reducing costs and length of stay for the older surgical population who experience an episode of acute post-operative delirium.",0
154,"Delirium is a common disease process in the pediatric critical care unit, yet practices for screening and prevention vary drastically between institutions. The authors hypothesized that surveying pediatric residents and nurses who care for patients in the intensive care setting would expose misunderstandings about delirium. They brought to light common incorrect beliefs that benzodiazepines are appropriate therapy for delirium and that children who are delirious will not have memories of the experience. Many nurses and residents listed that they were not comfortable or were extremely uncomfortable identifying delirious patients. Findings demonstrate an opportunity to improve on nursing and resident knowledge.",0
155,"This study aimed to assess intensive care unit (ICU) nurses' experiences caring for delirious patients and the empirical evaluation of the clinical feasibility of the confusion assessment method (CAM) for ICU (CAM-ICU). In Korea, neither regular assessment of early-stage delirium nor preventive interventions are carried out properly in the ICU. This study was conducted using a qualitative research design with focus group interviews. Nurses received training about the CAM-ICU, and used it to assess surgical ICU patients for the presence of delirium during a 5-month period. None of the nurses had heard of the CAM-ICU before the study, and many complained that it was very challenging to use. One positive outcome of the CAM-ICU trial was that the clinical interest in delirium increased. The CAM-ICU could be used to facilitate communication once the instrument becomes well-known among health care professionals.",0
156,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the experiences in nursing care in the prevention and treatment of delirium in people hospitalized in intensive care units. METHODOLOGY: Hermeneutic phenomenological qualitative study. The selection of participants was by intentional sampling: seven nursing assistants and eight nurses. Theoretical saturation was achieved. The phenomenological interview was applied to collect data from a central question and the analysis was carried out following the approaches of Heidegger's hermeneutical circle. RESULTS: Four significant themes emerged from the analysis: (1) delirium prevention, (2) pharmacological treatment, (3) non-pharmacological treatment, and (4) barriers to non-pharmacological treatment. These themes were accompanied by 35 interrelated units of meaning: in the first theme, the most repetitive units were communication, orientation, and family bonding; in the second was the use of pharmacological treatment only in the acute phase; in the third was the modification of the environment according to the patient's preference (where the family is a priority and strategies that provide cognitive and social stimulation can be reinforced), and in the fourth was the work overload for the nursing team. CONCLUSIONS: The experiences of the nursing team in the prevention and treatment of delirium in critically ill patients highlight that communication allows an approach to the patient as a human being immersed in a reality, with a personal history, needs and preferences. Therefore, family members must be involved in these scenarios, as they can complement and support nursing care.",0
157,"BACKGROUND: Delirium, an acute confusional state, is a health problem complicating the course of illness of hospitalized and ICU patients, including acute decompensated heart failure patients. The use of prevention protocols will necessitate education of clinicians, as an interdisciplinary team is developed. OBJECTIVE: Assess the impact of a 1-hour lecture and PowerPoint educational program on delirium and prevention protocols on nurses' knowledge. METHODS: A literature review was conducted on delirium risk in heart failure, prevention, and education. Nurses participated in a 1-hour nursing educational intervention on delirium prevention using lecture and PowerPoint. RESULTS: Results demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the means of the pre- and post- assessment scores, t (19) = 5.29, p = .00004 < ∝ = 0.05. McNemar's tests showed statistically significant differences in the in the pre- and post- assessment questions numbered 1, p = 0.001 and 3, p = 0.031. CONCLUSIONS: Effective education, driven by the severity of outcomes and high healthcare costs, will increase nursing knowledge of delirium prevention, thereby permitting nurses to tailor delirium prevention strategies consistent with high-quality nursing care. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses, who are equipped to tailor individual prevention strategies, will be strong advocates for the safety, mental and physical health of heart failure patients.",0
158,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute brain dysfunction associated with poor outcomes in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Critical care nurses play an important role in the prevention, detection, and management of delirium, but they must be able to accurately assess for it. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) instrument is a reliable and valid method to assess for delirium, but research reveals most nurses need practice to use it proficiently. METHOD: A pretest-posttest design was used to evaluate the success of a multimodal educational strategy (i.e., online learning module coupled with standardized patient simulation experience) on critical care nurses' knowledge and confidence to assess and manage delirium using the CAM-ICU. RESULTS: Participants (N = 34) showed a significant increase (p < .001) in confidence in their ability to assess and manage delirium following the multimodal education. No statistical change in knowledge of delirium existed following the education. CONCLUSION: A multimodal educational strategy, which included simulation, significantly added confidence in critical care nurses' performance using the CAM-ICU.

159,"BACKGROUND: Completion of a delirium detection tool allows rapid management, which alleviates complications. However, these tools are often underused. AIMS: To assess the effect of a knowledge transfer (KT) intervention on the completion of a delirium detection tool by nurses working with cardiac surgery patients. Secondary aims included describing completion rates per work shift, and patient characteristics associated with higher rates. METHODS: In a pre-post study, the intervention included a survey and focus groups to identify barriers to use of a delirium detection tool (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist [ICDSC]). Nurses' suggestions for a KT activity and its implementation were also included. Using chi-square analysis and medical charts from 242 patients, we compared the pre- and postintervention rates of completion of the ICDSC. RESULTS: The majority of nurses who completed the survey (n = 30) felt they had the knowledge, skills, and intention to complete the ICDSC. During the focus groups (n = 4), a need for information on delirium symptoms and its management was raised as a barrier. This barrier was addressed with the selected KT activity (clinical capsule and aide-memoire handed out to nurses [n = 24]). Across all work shifts, the completion rate was similar pre- and postintervention. Overall, the completion rate was lower during the day shift than the night and evening shifts. A higher rate was associated with the first three postoperative days, and longer hospital and intensive care unit stays. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: A tailored intervention based on preidentified barriers and facilitators, using the Determinants of Implementation Behavior Questionnaire, and in collaboration with participants, has the potential to promote evidence-based practice.",0
160,"BACKGROUND: Early mobilization is an evident, interprofessional concept to improve the outcome of intensive care patients. It reduces psychocognitive deficits and delirium and attenuates a general deconditioning, including atrophy of the respiratory pump and skeletal muscles. In this regard the interdisciplinary approach of early mobilization, taking into account different levels of mobilization, appears to be beneficial. The purpose of this study was to explore opinions on collaboration and tasks between different professional groups. METHOD: During the 25th Bremen Conference on Intensive Medicine and Nursing on 20 February 2015, a questionnaire survey was carried out among the 120 participants of the German Early Mobilization Network meeting. RESULTS: In all, 102 questionnaires were analyzed. Most participants reported on the interdisciplinarity of the approach, but none of the tasks and responsibilities concerning early mobilization can be assigned to a single professional group. The practical implementation of mobilizing orally intubated patients may require two registered nurses as well as a physical therapist. Implementation in daily practice seems to be heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: There is no consensus regarding collaboration, competencies, and responsibilities with respect to early mobilization of intensive care patients. The approach to date has been characterized by a lack of interprofessional communication, which may lead to an inefficient use of the broad and varied base of knowledge and experienceof the different professions.",0
161,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is the most common postoperative psychiatric condition in intensive care settings and can lead to increased complications and costs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of multifaceted preoperative patient education on postoperative delirium, anxiety, and knowledge and to explore predictors of postoperative delirium, days of mechanical ventilation, and days in the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. METHOD: A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted on consented patients from October 2011 to April 2013. Patients were randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio to receive either an individualized 45-minute multifaceted preoperative education (experimental group, n = 63) or standard education (control group, n = 66). Participants completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Knowledge Test before and after the education. Data on incidence of delirium, days of mechanical ventilation, ICU days, and cardiopulmonary parameters were collected. RESULTS: The experimental group had significantly more knowledge about postoperative care (P< .001) and fewer days of mechanical ventilation (P = .04) than the control group. The 2 groups did not differ significantly in anxiety, incidence of delirium, or ICU days. In exploratory multivariate analyses, hearing impairment was a positive predictor for days of delirium (P = .009), days of mechanical ventilation (P< .001), and ICU days (P= .049), whereas the posttest knowledge was a negative predictor for days of mechanical ventilation (P = .02). CONCLUSION: The patient education appeared to be effective in improving knowledge and reducing days of mechanical ventilation. Hearing impairment was an unexpected predictor of adverse outcomes for patients but may be amenable to nursing intervention.",0
162,"BACKGROUND: Communication interactions between nurses and mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are typically brief. Factors associated with length of nurses' communication have not been explored. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between nurse and patient characteristics and duration of nurse talk. METHODS: In this secondary analysis, we calculated duration of nurse talk in the first 3-min of video-recorded communication observation sessions for each nurse-patient dyad (n = 89) in the SPEACS study (4 observation sessions/dyad, n = 356). In addition, we explored the association between nurses' characteristics (age, gender, credentials, nursing experience, and critical care experience) and patients' characteristics (age, gender, race, education, delirium, agitation-sedation, severity of illness, level of consciousness, prior intubation history, days intubated prior to study enrollment, and type of intubation) on duration of nurse talk during the 3-min interaction observation. RESULTS: Duration of nurse talk ranged from 0-123 s and varied significantly over the 4 observation sessions (p = .007). Averaging the duration of nurse talk over the observation sessions, differences in talk time between the units varied significantly by study group (p < .001). Talk duration was negatively associated with a Glasgow Coma Scale ≤14 (p = .008). Length of intubation prior to study enrollment had a curvilinear relationship with talking duration (linear p = .002, quadratic p = .013); the point of inflection was at 23 days. Nurse characteristics were not significantly related to duration of nurse talk. CONCLUSION: Length of time the patient is intubated, and the patient's level of consciousness may influence duration of nurse communication in ICU.",0
163,"BACKGROUND: Use of the interprofessional Awakening and Breathing Coordination, Delirium Monitoring and Management, and Early Mobility (ABCDE) bundle is recommended practice in intensive care, but its adoption remains limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between intensive care unit provider attitudes regarding the ABCDE bundle and ABCDE bundle adherence. METHODS: A 1-time survey of 268 care providers in 10 intensive care units across the country who had worked at least 4 shifts per month to examine their attitudes toward workload burden, difficulty carrying out the bundle, perceived safety, confidence, and perceived strength of evidence. Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship of unit-level provider attitudes with ABCDE bundle adherence in 101 patients, adjusted for patients' age, severity of illness, and comorbidity. RESULTS: For every unit increase in workload burden, adherence to the ABCDE bundle decreased 53% (odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28-0.79; P = .004). Bundle difficulty (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.08-1.07), perceived safety (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.10-2.65), confidence (OR, 0.37, 95% CI, 0.10-1.35), and perceived strength of evidence (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.14-3.35) were not associated with ABCDE bundle adherence. For every unit increase in perceived difficulty carrying out the bundle, adherence with early mobility was reduced 59% (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19-0.90; P = .03). In addition, ABCDE bundle adherence (ie, ventilator bundle) was less than DE bundle adherence (ie, ventilator-free bundle) (97% vs 72%, z = 5.47; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Focusing interventions on workload burden and factors influencing bundle difficulty may facilitate ABCDE bundle adherence.",0
164,"Delirium in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting is often unrecognized and undertreated. The importance of screening and identification of ICU delirium has been identified in both adult and pediatric literature. Delirium increases ICU morbidity, length of mechanical ventilation and length of stay. The objective of this study was to determine the current knowledge level about delirium and its risk factors among pediatric critical care nurses through a short questionnaire. We hypothesized that before a targeted educational intervention, PICU care providers do not have an adequate knowledge base for accurate screening and diagnosis of delirium in critically ill children. A 17 question online survey was given to all nurses in a tertiary 36-bed PICU to assess current knowledge about delirium in children. The response rate was 73% (105/143). When asked to identify the correct way to diagnose pediatric delirium, 11.4% of nurses surveyed (12/105) incorrectly believed that Glasgow Coma Score is the appropriate screening tool. A large proportion of respondents (40/105) believed that benzodiazepines are helpful in treatment of delirium. The results of the survey identified specific knowledge gaps about risk factors and treatment of pediatric delirium in the critically ill child. There is a critical need for education about pediatric delirium and its risk factors among PICU staff prior to unit-wide implementation of a delirium screening and prevention program, specifically with regards to screening methods and pharmacologic risk factors. These results are likely generalizable to all physicians, nurses and staff who care for critically ill children.",0
165,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore older inpatients' experiences and perceptions of delirium and nonpharmacological delirium prevention strategies (NDPS). BACKGROUND: Delirium is a distressing and serious complication in hospitalised older adults. NDPS (supporting nutrition, mobility and cognitive participation) have strong supporting evidence. Few studies have explored older inpatients' perspectives of these strategies. This information may assist staff to better support patient participation in NDPS. DESIGN: Qualitative study using an interpretive descriptive (ID) methodological approach to explore older patient's experience of delirium and NDPS. METHODS: Structured interviews of inpatients aged over 65 years across 6 medical and surgical wards explored patients' experiences and perceptions of delirium and prevention activities related to nutrition, mobility and cognition; and barriers and enablers to participation. Reporting used COREQ. RESULTS: Twenty-three participants were included (12 male, 11 reported delirium experience). Participants reported a range of physiological, emotional and psychological responses to delirium, hearing about delirium was different to experiencing it. Most participants were aware of the benefits of maintaining nutrition and hydration, physical activity and cognitive engagement in hospital. Barriers included poor symptom control, inflexible routines and inconsistent communication, whilst enablers included access to equipment, family involvement, staff encouragement and individual goals. These were organised into themes: outlook, feeling well enough, hospital environment, feeling informed and listened to, and support networks. CONCLUSION: A more patient-centred approach to delirium prevention requires consideration of older people's values, needs, preferences and fit within the hospital environment and routines. Feeling informed, listened to and receiving support from staff and family carers can improve older inpatients' engagement in NPDS to prevent delirium in hospital. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses are ideally placed to improve patient participation in NDPS through holistic assessment and care, addressing symptoms, providing clear information about delirium and delirium prevention, and facilitating family carer support and patient interactions.",0
166,"RATIONALE: Poor sleep affects a majority of critically ill patients and is believed to be associated with adverse intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes such as delirium. While recent guidelines recommend sleep promotion efforts to improve delirium and other ICU outcomes, little is known about critical care providers' beliefs regarding sleep in the ICU. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate providers' perceptions and practices regarding sleep in the ICU. METHODS: From April to July 2014, the Sleep in the ICU Survey was disseminated to ICU providers via institutional e-mail lists and four international critical care society distribution lists. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 1,223 surveys were completed by providers from 24 countries. Respondents were primarily nurses (59%) or physicians (39%). Most respondents indicated that ICU patients experienced ""poor"" or ""very poor"" sleep (75%) and that poor sleep could affect the ICU recovery process (88%). Respondents also felt that poor sleep was associated with negative ICU outcomes such as the development of delirium (97%), longer length of stay (88%), poor participation in physical therapy (87%), and delayed liberation from mechanical ventilation (83%). The minority (32%) of providers had sleep-promoting protocols; these providers tended to believe their patients slept longer and experienced better sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Though most clinicians believe that sleep in the ICU is poor and adversely affects patient outcomes, a minority of the ICUs represented by our respondents have sleep promotion protocols. These findings highlight discordant provider perceptions and practices surrounding sleep in the ICU, as well as a possible lack of available evidence-based guidelines for promoting sleep in the ICU.",0
167,"Mental disorders are characterized by disturbances of thought, perception, affect and behavior, which occur as a result of brain damage. Recognizing and treating these conditions is necessary not only for psychiatrists but for all physicians. Disorder of mental function is one of the most common associated conditions in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, disturbances of mental function often remain unrecognized. In ICU patients, different types of mental function disorders may develop. They range from sleep disorders, severe depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cognitive disorders including delirium. The causes of mental dysfunction in ICU patients can be divided into environmental and medical. Cognitive disorders are related to mental processes such as learning ability, memory, perception and problem solving. Cognitive disorders are usually not prominent in the early postoperative period and in many cases are discovered after hospital discharge because of difficulties in performing everyday activities at home or at work. The etiology of postoperative cognitive impairment is unclear. Older age, previous presence of cognitive dysfunction, severity of disease, and polypharmacy with more than four drugs are some of the risk factors identified. Delirium is a multifactorial disorder. It is an acute confusional state characterized by alteration of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. It is considered as the most common form of mental distress in ICU patients. Nearly 30% of all hospitalized patients pass through deliriant phase during their hospital stay. Delirium can last for several days to several weeks. Almost always it ends with complete withdrawal of psychopathological symptoms. Sometimes it can evolve into a chronic brain syndrome (dementia). The causes are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease the symptoms. Delirious patient is at risk of complications of immobility and confusion, leading to a high prevalence of irreversible functional decline. An interdisciplinary approach to delirium should also include family or other caregivers. In the diagnosis of delirium, several tests are used to complement clinical assessment. Among the most commonly used are the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test. Depression is a common disorder among patients treated at ICU and occurs due to the impact of the disease on the body and the quality of life, independence, employment and other aspects of life. Depression can interfere with the speed of recovery, affects the postoperative quality of life, and in a certain number of patients may lead to suicidal thoughts and intentions. Phobias and generalized anxiety are the most common anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by strong, excessive anxiety and worry about everyday life events. PTSD is delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation, extremely threatening or catastrophic nature, which is outside the common experience of people and would hit or traumatize almost all people. Treatment of delirium and other disorders is causal. The causes of psychosis are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease symptoms. The primary objective of prevention is appropriate therapy and correction of potential imbalances possibly underlying disturbances, stabilization of vital functions as well as early return to daily activities. Doctors and other medical staff must be aware of the importance and consequences of behavioral and emotional disorders in critically ill patients. Additional research is needed to discover the ways to prevent and/ or reduce the frequency and severity of the consequences and treatment of cognitive and emotional disorders.",0
168,"The number of elderly, both in society at large and in the critical care population, is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Critical care nurses must address how best to provide care to these elders. The authors focus on physiologic, cognitive, and psychosocial characteristics of the elderly that place them at risk for complications during their stay in critical care. The critical care environment also contributes to complications such as sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation or overload, painful procedures, and decreased social support. The critical care environment may also be a factor in facilitating delirium, common in critically ill elders. Critical care nurses can proactively help to create a healing environment for these elders by facilitating sleep, implementing strategies to reduce delirium, preventing or minimizing painful experiences, and liberalizing family visitations.",0
169,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate change in practice and beliefs regarding delirium among nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists and physicians in a trauma intensive care unit. METHODOLOGY/DESIGN/SETTING: Descriptive pre and post-design at a Level One Trauma Center. Education on causes of delirium, risk factors, strategies to prevent delirium and routine screening. OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in practice and beliefs regarding delirium. RESULTS: McNemars test measured the differences between pre- and post-questionnaires comparing the proportion of staff changed their responses in one direction to those who went in the opposite direction. Changes in ""Delirium is largely preventable"", were statistically significant (p=0.035). Haldol was the medication of choice for treating delirium, with an increase in use (p=0.062) post-intervention. The majority of participants believed a high percentage of patients experience delirium in a trauma intensive care. The two most frequent medical complications associated with delirium pre-questionnaire was over sedation 8 (22%) and falls 9 (24%) and in post-questionnaire, over sedation 12 (26%) and falls 13 (28%). CONCLUSIONS: An educational intervention emphasising the importance of screening for delirium, risk factors for delirium and approaches to decrease the incidence of delirium can improve identifying and correctly treating delirium in a critical care setting. An educational program had concrete results in respondents' knowledge about delirium.",0
170,"BACKGROUND: Despite practice guidelines promoting delirium assessment in intensive care, few data exist regarding current delirium assessment practices among nurses and how these practices compare with those for sedation assessment. OBJECTIVES: To identify current practices and perceptions of intensive care nurses regarding delirium assessment and to compare practices for assessing delirium with practices for assessing sedation. METHODS: A paper/Web-based survey was administered to 601 staff nurses working in 16 intensive care units at 5 acute care hospitals with sedation guidelines specifying delirium assessment in the Boston, Massachusetts area. RESULTS: Overall, 331 nurses (55%) responded. Only 3% ranked delirium as the most important condition to evaluate, compared with altered level of consciousness (44%), presence of pain (23%), or improper placement of an invasive device (21%). Delirium assessment was less common than sedation assessment (47% vs 98%, P < .001) and was more common among nurses who worked in medical intensive care units (55% vs 40%, P = .03) and at academic centers (53% vs 13%, P < .001). Preferred methods for assessing delirium included assessing ability to follow commands (78%), checking for agitation-related events (71%), the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (36%), the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (11%), and psychiatric consultation (9%). Barriers to assessment included intubation (38%), complexity of the tool for assessing delirium (34%), and sedation level (13%). CONCLUSIONS: Practice and perceptions of delirium assessment vary widely among critical care nurses despite the presence of institutional sedation guidelines that promote delirium assessment.",0
171,"Transplantation provides life-saving therapy to critically ill patients with end-stage organ failure. We found that the specialized knowledge of mental health clinicians and physicians, committed to the evaluation and management of transplant recipients, is essential for the optimal care of these patients who require a life-long regimen of immunosuppressive medication and dependency on the transplant team. Critical issues requiring psychiatric input are frequently encountered in the following areas (1) patient selection and informed consent; (2) recognition and pretransplant treatment of psychiatric disorders; (3) substance or alcohol abuse; (4) compliance with medical regimens; (5) posttransplant psychosis; and (6) immunosuppressive/psychiatric drug-drug interactions. This review focuses on the priorities in psychological and psychiatric care of these unique patients.",0
172,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to analyse the level of distress caused by delirium in patients' family and their nurses, and to identify factors associated with psychological distress in families of older adult inpatients in Intermediate Care Units/IMCUs regarding their global experience during hospitalization. METHOD: A prospective pilot study was carried out with families and nurses of older adult patients (≥65 y.o.) consecutively recruited from two IMCUs in Intensive Care Medicine Service in a University Hospital. Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale ≤11, brain injury, blindness/deafness and inability to communicate were excluded. Delirium was daily assessed with Confusion Assessment Method/CAM. The distress level regarding this episode in family and nurses was measured with Delirium Experience Questionnaire/DEQ. Family psychological distress of all recruited patients was assessed with Kessler Psychological Distress Scale/K10. RESULTS: This study included 42 inpatients (mean age/MA = 78 y.o., 50% women), 32 families (68.8% sons/daughters, MA = 50.6 y.o., 81.3% women) and 12 nurses caring for delirium patients (MA = 33 y.o., all women). A total of 12 (28.6%) patients had delirium. Distress related to this episode were higher for families than for nurses (M = 3 vs. M = 2), but differences did not reach statistical significance (Z = -1.535, p = 0.125). The hierarchical regression model explained 44.3% of variability in family psychological distress. Higher levels of psychological distress were associated with living with the patient (p = 0.029), presence of previous cognitive decline (p = 0.048) and development of delirium (p = 0.010). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results show that family psychological distress is higher, when older adult patients developed delirium during hospitalization. Particular attention to these family carers should be given in future development of psychological support and psychoeducational interventions.",0
173,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the knowledge of multi-professional staff members about the early mobilization of critically ill adult patients and identify attitudes and perceived barriers to its application. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the second semester of 2016 with physicians, nursing professionals and physical therapists from six intensive care units at two teaching hospitals. Questions were answered on a 5-point Likert scale and analyzed as proportions of professionals who agreed or disagreed with statements. The chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to investigate differences in the responses according to educational/training level, previous experience with early mobilization and years of experience in intensive care units. RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 98 out of 514 professionals (response rate: 19%). The acknowledged benefits of early mobilization were maintenance of muscle strength (53%) and shortened length of mechanical ventilation (83%). Favorable attitudes toward early mobilization included recognition that its benefits for patients under mechanical ventilation exceed the risks for both patients and staff, that early mobilization should be routinely performed via nursing and physical therapy protocols, and readiness to change the parameters of mechanical ventilation and reduce sedation to facilitate the early mobilization of patients. The main barriers mentioned were the unavailability of professionals and time to mobilize patients, excessive sedation, delirium, risk of musculoskeletal self-injury and excessive stress at work. CONCLUSION: The participants were aware of the benefits of early mobilization and manifested attitudes favorable to its application. However, the actual performance of early mobilization was perceived as a challenge, mainly due to the lack of professionals and time, excessive sedation, delirium, risk of musculoskeletal self-injury and excessive stress at work.",0
174,"AIMS: To evaluate an education intervention to decrease restraint use in patients in a Trauma Intensive Care Unit (TICU) and to evaluate nurses' perceptions regarding restraints. OBJECTIVES: To measure restraint use pre/post-intervention and to measure nurses' perceptions of restraint use. METHODS: Pre/post-intervention design to collate incidences of delirium and restraints pre/post-intervention. Data reporting nurses' views and preferences were collected pre-intervention. MEASURES: Patients were assessed by nursing on admission and every shift with the Confusion Assessment Method for TICU. Restraint use was measured in a 24-hour period. Nurses' perception of restraints was measured using Perceptions of Restraint Use Questionnaire (PRUQ). RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was demonstrated in restraint use before and after the educational intervention. Mean and standard deviation for restraints per 1000 patient days pre-intervention was 314.1 (35.4), post-intervention 237.8 (56.4) (p=0.008). Mean PRUQ overall, 3.57 (range 1-5) indicated that nurses had positive attitudes towards restraints in certain circumstances. The primary reasons for using restraints were: ""protecting patients from falling out of bed"", 37 (72.5%), and ""protecting patients from falling out of chair"", 34 (66.7%). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a low risk educational intervention aimed at use of an alternative device use can reduce restraint use.",0
175,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe intensive care nurses' perceptions and assessments of unpleasant symptoms and signs in mechanically ventilated and sedated adult intensive care patients. BACKGROUND: Mechanically ventilated patients are unable to express themselves verbally and depend upon nurses to control their symptoms by understanding their unpleasant experiences, such as pain, anxiety or delirium and interpret the relevant signs. Nurses must have enough knowledge to adjust their analgesics and sedatives appropriately and to avoid under- or oversedation. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey design. METHODS: A study with a self-administrated questionnaire was undertaken in October 2007 to February 2008, with a convenience sample of 183 intensive care nurses in Norway. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 86 (47%) nurses. Most perceived that critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy occurred frequently. Half the nurses underestimated pain, anxiety and delirium. Signs such as a response to contact, cough reflex, wakefulness and muscle tone were considered most important in assessing oversedation. Agitation, facial grimacing, tube intolerance and wakefulness were considered most important in assessing undersedation. The Comfort Scale and Adoption of the Intensive Care Environment corresponded best to the signs identified by the nurses. CONCLUSION: The nurses underestimated unpleasant symptoms other than critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy. A further mapping of patients' experiences should be conducted, with an emphasis on the more 'silent' distressing symptoms. Further tools to facilitate the communication of consciousness levels and the intolerance of unpleasant symptoms must be developed and implemented. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A deeper understanding of unpleasant symptoms and signs focused in learning activities may help nurses to recognize patients' early problems and allow targeted interventions. A more active stimulus-response assessment of ICU patients is required to detect oversedation, critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy and hypoactive delirium. Assessment tools should reflect both the patient's tolerance of various unpleasant symptoms and the level of consciousness.",0
176,"A significant portion of critical care patients experience delirium. This form of acute brain dysfunction is associated with increased hospital stay, increased mortality, and greater long-term cognitive deficits. Critical care nurses are on the frontline with these patients and can make a significant impact on patient outcomes, including reducing the negative outcomes and experience of delirium. It is, therefore, imperative that nurses be equipped with a solid knowledge base of understanding delirium, which includes what has been reported specifically unique to delirium in the intensive care unit. This article will provide an overview of delirium and describe an interdisciplinary model of care combining multiple evidence-based practice strategies that nurses can and should use to help systematically reduce modifiable delirium risk factors. In addition, this article will provide an overview of recent reports concerning pharmacologic management of delirium in the intensive care unit.",0
177,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess intensive care unit nurses' knowledge of intensive care unit delirium and delirium assessment before and after an educational intervention. In addition, nurses' perception on the usefulness of a delirium assessment tool and barriers against delirium assessment were assessed as secondary objectives. BACKGROUND: Early identification of delirium in intensive care units is crucial for patient care. Hence, nurses require adequate knowledge to enable appropriate evaluation of delirium using standardised practice and assessment tools. DESIGN: This study, performed in Malaysia, used a single-group pretest-posttest study design to assess the effect of educational interventions and hands-on practices on nurses' knowledge of intensive care unit delirium and delirium assessment. METHODS: Sixty-one nurses participated in educational intervention sessions, including classroom learning, demonstrations and hands-on practices on the Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires for the pre- and postintervention assessments. Analysis to determine the effect of the educational intervention consisted of the repeated-measures analysis of covariance. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the knowledge scores pre- and postintervention, after controlling for demographic characteristics. The two most common perceived barriers to the adoption of the intensive care unit delirium assessment tool were ""physicians did not use nurses' delirium assessment in decision-making"" and ""difficult to interpret delirium in intubated patients"". CONCLUSIONS: Educational intervention and hands-on practices increased nurses' knowledge of delirium assessment. Teaching and interprofessional involvements are essential for a successful implementation of intensive care unit delirium assessment practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study supports existing evidences, indicating that education and training could increase nurses' knowledge of delirium and delirium assessment. Improving nurses' knowledge could potentially lead to better delirium management practice and improve ICU patient care. Thus, continuous efforts to improve and sustain nurses' knowledge become relevant in ICU settings.",0
178,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the characteristics of patients with ""persistent critical illness"" (PerCI), as perceived by Australian and New Zealand intensive care unit clinicians. Patients with PerCI were defined as those whose reason for being in the ICU was now more related to their ongoing critical illness than their original reason for admission to the ICU. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a web-based survey, we recruited clinicians affiliated with the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Clinical Trials Group (CTG) who cared for adults. Clinicians included doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, dietitians, research managers and others. We used the ANZICS-CTG mailing list to email a single request for anonymous participation. RESULTS: A total of 101 eligible clinicians responded to our survey. PerCI was believed to develop after a median of 10 days (IQR, 7-14 days), and to be somewhat uncommon (occurring in 10% of all ICU patients [IQR, 5%-15%], and in 50% of all patients with a prolonged ICU length of stay [IQR, 20%-60%]). Ninety per cent of respondents thought that patients with PerCI required ongoing invasive mechanical ventilation, and the most common problems were thought to be respiratory insufficiency (68%), delirium (59%) and acquired neuromuscular disease (54%). Ten per cent of patients with PerCI were expected to be alive and well and at home 6 months after ICU discharge, with another 15% alive and at home but requiring significant help. The remainder were expected to die within 6 months or to need institutional care. CONCLUSION: Patients with PerCI appear to be an identifiable group of ICU patients, with definable characteristics, substantial stress associated with their care, and poor perceived long-term outcomes.",0
179,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a major complication associated with anaesthesia and surgery, more commonly seen in older people. AIMS: The aims of this study were to explore the knowledge and understanding of anaesthetists and nurses involved in anaesthesia through their responses to two case scenarios of postoperative delirium experienced by older people. METHODS: A 30-item online survey was sent to 500 potential respondents. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-six practitioners from Australia, New Zealand and Scotland responded. Most had no workplace protocols for anaesthesia planning in older people. There was substantial variability in practice in relation to postoperative delirium screening, detection, prevention and management. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in education and awareness, together with a more coherent approach, for example, as recommended in the European Society of Anaesthesiology Guidelines, could help to reduce the impact of postoperative delirium in older people. This should be combined with ongoing research into perioperative optimisation of detection, prevention and management of postoperative delirium.",0
180,"OBJECTIVES: To survey the awareness and observation of delirium, and interventions used for delirium in Swedish intensive care units (ICUs) and to examine the influence of hospital categories and staff education on the afore-mentioned. DESIGN: A questionnaire was sent to all Swedish adult patient ICUs (n=82) and completed by 55 units. RESULTS: The reported prevalence of delirium was 9.4%. Assessment of delirium was performed by 62% of the ICUs, commonly by observing symptoms. Most of the suggested non-pharmacologic interventions were reported to be used by at least 85% of the units. Drugs were used by 96%, most commonly haloperidol, propofol and benzodiazepines. Written pharmacological guidelines existed in 26% of the units, while 9% had non-pharmacological guidelines. Regular observation of delirium was more common in larger hospitals than in smaller ones and education was associated with reporting a higher prevalence of delirium. CONCLUSION: As in other countries, this study demonstrated that the awareness of delirium in ICUs is low with a lack of implementation of validated screening tools for its diagnosis. Emphasis should be placed on education and implementation of these tools to improve the quality of care for ICU patients.",0
181,"BACKGROUND: The Stanford Proxy Test for Delirium (S-PTD) is a tool developed to be completed by nurses at the end of their shift. It was designed to use the knowledge acquired during a full shift of nurse-patient interaction. The objective of our study was to validate the S-PTD among a mixed sample of patients in both the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU settings. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in an ICU and three general medical wards in a tertiary care hospital. Patients were independently and blindly assessed for delirium by (1) the patients' primary nurses using the S-PTD at the end of their shift, and (2) a Consultation liaison psychiatrist who conducted a neuropsychiatric evaluation based on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). RESULTS: A total 288 patients were included in current analysis. Using the S-PTD, delirium was identified in 72 (25.0%), while an expert neuropsychiatric examination, based on DSM-5 identified delirium in 75 (26.0%) patients. This study demonstrated that the S-PTD has very strong discriminative ability (area under the curve= 0.946, p<0.001). An S-PTD cut-off score ≥3 was associated with an 82.7% sensitivity, an 95.3% specificity, an 86.1% positive predictive value, a 94.0% negative predictive value, and a 92.0% overall diagnostic accuracy. These results were similar in both ICU and general ward patients. CONCLUSION: The S-PTD has excellent sensitivity and specificity in detecting delirium in both ICU and ward patients, even when compared with the gold-standard, a DSM-based neuropsychiatric examination.",0
182,"BACKGROUND: Nonpharmacologic delirium-prevention strategies are commonly used in the intensive care unit by bedside nurses. With up to 80% of intensive care unit patients becoming delirious, and lacking treatment options, prevention is key. However, with increasing nurse workloads, innovative delirium-prevention strategies such as involving the patient's family are needed. OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into opinions of patients' families regarding active participation in delirium-prevention activities to inform specific recommendations for involving patients' families in such activities. METHODS: Purposeful sampling was used. Patients' families were contacted to be interviewed about their opinions and attitudes on participation in nonpharmacologic delirium prevention activities while visiting the intensive care unit. An interview guide was created and used to facilitate discussion. Interviews were conducted, transcribed verbatim, and coded by 2 independent coders. Themes were identified, defined, and compared between independent coders; disagreements were resolved by the study team. RESULTS: After 10 interviews were conducted, thematic saturation occurred. Three major themes emerged: (1) consistent family presence and participation in care, (2) improving ease of interactions between family and patient, and (3) delirium education for families. CONCLUSION: Family members want to be involved with care and delirium prevention; however, many times they do not know what to do without the direction of a health care provider. Family members would benefit from open dialogue with the bedside nurse to increase family comfort and involvement in care.",0
183,"OBJECTIVE: A 2001 survey found that most healthcare professionals considered intensive care unit (ICU) delirium as a serious problem, but only 16% used a validated delirium screening tool. Our objective was to assess beliefs and practices regarding ICU delirium and sedation management. DESIGN AND SETTING: Between October 2006 and May 2007, a survey was distributed to ICU practitioners in 41 North American hospitals, seven international critical care meetings and courses, and the American Thoracic Society e-mail database. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 1384 healthcare professionals including 970 physicians, 322 nurses, 23 respiratory care practitioners, 26 pharmacists, 18 nurse practitioners and physicians' assistants, and 25 others. RESULTS: A majority [59% (766 of 1300)] estimated that more than one in four adult mechanically ventilated patients experience delirium. More than half [59% (774 of 1302)] screen for delirium, with 33% of those respondents (258 of 774) using a specific screening tool. A majority of respondents use a sedation protocol, but 29% (396 of 1355) still do not. A majority (76%, 990 of 1309) has a written policy on spontaneous awakening trials (SATs), but the minority of respondents (44%, 446 of 1019) practice spontaneous awakening trials on more than half of ICU days. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is considered a serious problem by a majority of healthcare professionals, and the percent of practitioners using a specific screening tool has increased since the last published survey data. Although most respondents have adopted specific sedation protocols and have an approved approach to stopping sedation daily, few report even modest compliance with daily cessation of sedation.",0
184,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to discuss the role of the adult-gerontology clinical nurse specialist in addressing the problem of delirium in hospitalized older adults through strategies to improve nurse knowledge. BACKGROUND: Delirium is a significant issue in hospitalized older adults. This acute confusional state can adversely impact older adults in various ways. Delirium has been implicated in (1) poor physical, cognitive, and psychological outcomes, (2) prolonged hospitalizations, (3) increased costs of care, (4) need for continued postacute care, and (5) patient and provider stress. To prevent delirium, nurses must possess the knowledge to identify risk factors and institute preventive strategies. Once a change in mental status occurs, it is critical that nurses recognize delirium and the steps necessary to provide safe, effective care. Nurses are the major providers of bedside care; however, multiple studies have identified a lack of nurse knowledge regarding delirium. The adult-gerontology clinical nurse specialist can be instrumental in fostering knowledge on this important issue. DESCRIPTION: Multiple interventions can be conducted by the adult-gerontology clinical nurse specialist with acute care nurses to increase delirium knowledge. A review of the literature revealed strategies that might be used in the hospital setting. Before educational endeavors, it is crucial to assess baseline nurse knowledge of delirium. Educational strategies can then include use of standardized delirium assessment tools, implementation of the Geriatric Resource Nurse model, fostering geriatric case studies and simulations, conducting geriatric grand rounds, and development of structured delirium educational programs. Exploring the patient experience, post delirium, can provide an invaluable, first-hand account of the acute confusional state. This information can impact nurse knowledge as well as patient safety and well-being. Geriatric certification and professional organizational involvement can be encouraged. Numerous online geriatric resources can be shared with nurses to enhance knowledge of delirium. OUTCOME: Improved nurse knowledge will assist in preventing/decreasing incidents of delirium and thwart the negative outcomes associated with delirium occurrence in hospitalized older adults. IMPLICATIONS: Nurse knowledge can be measured and patient care assessed to determine the effectiveness of the proposed educational strategies. CONCLUSION: The goal of the identified adult-gerontology clinical nurse specialist-led educational initiatives is to improve knowledge of delirium, which will assist nurses in providing evidence-based, safe, appropriate care to all hospitalized older adults.",0
185,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of education on nurses' knowledge of delirium, knowledge and perception of a validated screening tool, and delirium screening in the ICU. METHODS: A quasi-experimental single group pretest-post-test design. SETTING: A 16 bed ICU in a Canadian urban tertiary care centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nursing knowledge and perception were measured at baseline, 3-month and 18-month periods. Delirium screening was then assessed over 24-months. RESULTS: During the study period, 197 surveys were returned; 84 at baseline, 53 at 3-months post education, and 60 at the final assessment period 18-months post intervention. The significant improvements in mean knowledge scores at 3-months post intervention (7.2, SD 1.3) were not maintained at 18-months (5.3, SD 1.1). Screening tool perception scores remained unchanged. Improvements in the perception of utility were significant at both time periods (p=0.03, 0.02 respectively). Physician value significantly improved at 18-months (p=0.01). Delirium screening frequency improved after education (p<0.001) demonstrating a positive correlation over time (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Multifaceted education is effective in improving delirium knowledge and screening; however, without sustained effort, progress is transient. Education improved perceived tool utility and over time utility perception and physician value improved.",0
186,"In summary, ICU psychosis does not develop in all patients. Instead, many patients are at risk for hypoactive, hyperactive, or mixed hypoactive and hyperactive delirium. Prevention of delirium should always be foremost, including recognition of patients at high risk, minimal use of causative medications, and treatment of physiological conditions that are often unrelated to a patient's admitting diagnosis. When prevention fails, early diagnosis and treatment can make a marked difference in patients' outcomes. The potential adverse outcomes of delirium are well documented. These include increased mortality; increased length of stay; reduced level of functioning in the elderly, which often leads to placement in a nursing home; and stress response syndrome after hospitalization. The value of nursing in preventing delirium is evident when nurses apply their knowledge of potential causes and develop strategies to avoid these causes in their patients. Nurses provide early detection and coordinate with other members of the healthcare team to initiate a plan of care that includes prompt treatment of delirium to reduce the signs and symptoms, duration, and potential adverse sequelae of this disorder. Nursing interventions are designed to enhance patients' cognitive status, sense of security, safety, and comfort. Nurses are instrumental in providing appropriate choices, doses, and administration of medications and in recognizing side effects. Use of medications ordered to treat delirium is often left to nurses' discretion because the orders specify that the drugs should be given as needed. Finally, nurses are the ones who recognize the need for additional assistance via psychiatric consultations or for more intensive observation and management of patients to ensure quality care.",0
187,"AIM: The general aim of this study was to explore the decision-making process followed by Intensive Care Unit (ICU) health professionals with respect to physical restraint (PR) administration and management, along with the factors that influence it. METHOD: A qual-quant multimethod design was sequenced in two stages: an initial stage following a qualitative methodology; and second, quantitative with a predominant descriptive approach. The multicenter study was undertaken at 17 ICUs belonging to 11 public hospitals in the Madrid region (Spain) across the period 2015 through 2019. The qualitative stage was performed from an interpretative phenomenological perspective. A total of eight discussion groups (DG) were held, with the participation of 23 nurses, 12 patient care nursing assistants, and seven physicians. Intentional purposive sampling was carried out. DG were tape-recorded and transcribed. A thematic analysis of the latent content was performed. In the quantitative stage, we maintained a 96-h observation period at each ICU. Variables pertaining to general descriptive elements of each ICU, institutional pain-agitation/sedation-delirium (PAD) monitoring policies and elements linked to quality of PR use were recorded. A descriptive analysis was performed, and the relationship between the variables was analyzed. The level of significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. FINDINGS: A total of 1070 patients were observed, amounting to a median prevalence of PR use of 19.11% (min: 0%-max: 44.44%). The differences observed between ICUs could be explained by a difference in restraint conceptualization. The various actors involved jointly build up a health care culture and a conceptualization of the terms ""safety-risk"", which determine decision-making about the use of restraints at each ICU. These shared meanings are the germ of beliefs, values, and rituals which, in this case, determine the greater or lesser use of restraints. There were different profiles of PR use among the units studied: preventive restraints versus ""Zero"" restraints. The differences corresponded to aspects such as: systematic use of tools for assessment of PAD; interpretation of patient behavior; the decision-making process, the significance attributed to patient safety and restraints; and the feelings generated by PR use. The restraint-free model requires an approach to safety from a holistic perspective, with the involvement of all team members and the family.",0
188,"BACKGROUND: Critical care nurses are in the best position to detect and monitor delirium in critically ill patients. Therefore, an optimum delirium assessment tool with strong evidence should be identified with critical care nurses to perform in the daily assessment. AIM: To evaluate and compare the diagnostic performance of delirium assessment tools in diagnosing delirium in critically ill patients. METHODS: We searched five electronic databases including the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and a Chinese database for eligible diagnostic studies published in English or Mandarin up to December 2018. This diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis was limited to studies in intensive care unit (ICU) settings, using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) as a standard reference to test the accuracy of delirium assessment tools. Eligible studies were critically appraised by two investigators independently. The summary of evidence was conducted for pooling and comparing diagnostic accuracy by a bivariate random effects meta-analysis model. The pooled sensitivities and specificities, summary receiver operating characteristic curve (sROC), the area under the curve (AUC), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated and plotted. The possibility of publication bias was assessed by Deeks' funnel plot. DATA SYNTHESIS: We identified and evaluated 23 and 8 articles focused on CAM-ICU and ICDSC, respectively. The summary sensitivities of 0.85 and 0.87, and summary specificities of 0.95 and 0.91 were found for CAM-ICU and ICDSC, respectively. The AUC of the CAM-ICU was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.98), with DOR at 99 (95% CI, 55-177). The AUC of the ICDSC was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92-0.96), and the DOR was 65 (95% CI, 27-153). LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: CAM-ICU demonstrated higher diagnostic test accuracy and is recommended as the optimal delirium assessment tool. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the between-study heterogeneity of this diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis.",0
189,"BACKGROUND: Critical-care nurses play a vital role in promoting safe early mobilization in intensive care unit (ICU) settings to reduce the risks associated with immobility in ICUs, including the risk of delirium, ICU-acquired weakness, and functional decline. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to describe nurse-led mobilization practices in 2 community hospital ICUs and to report differences and similarities between the 2 settings. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional exploratory study of 18 nurses (ICU A: n = 12, ICU B: n = 6) and 124 patients (ICU A: n = 50, ICU B: n = 74). Patient-specific therapeutic intervention needs and nurse-initiated mobilization practices were tracked over a 1-month period. RESULTS: Differences in patient characteristics and nurse-led mobilization activities were observed between ICUs. After controlling for patient characteristics, we found statistically significant differences in nurse-led mobilization activities between the 2 units, suggesting that factors other than patient characteristics may explain differences in nurse-led mobilization practices.",0
190,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences, beliefs and perceptions of intensive care unit (ICU) nurses on the management of pain, agitation and delirium (PAD) in critically ill patients. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study. SETTING: This study took place in a community hospital ICU located in a medium size Canadian city. PARTICIPANTS: Purposeful sampling was conducted. Participants included full-time nurses working in the ICU. Forty-six ICU nurses participated. METHODS: A total of five focus group sessions were held to collect data. There were one to three separate groups in each focus group session, with no more than seven participants in each group. There were 10 separate groups in total. A semistructured question guide was used. Thematic analysis method was adopted to analyse the data, and to search for emergent themes and patterns. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: (1) the professional perspectives on patient wakefulness state, (2) the professional perspectives on PAD management of critically ill patients and (3) the factors impacting PAD management. Nurses have different opinions on the optimal level of patient sedation and felt that many factors, including environmental, healthcare teams, patients and family members, can influence PAD management. This potentially leads to inconsistent PAD management in critically ill patients. The nurses also believed that PAD management requires a multidisciplinary approach including healthcare teams and patients' families. CONCLUSIONS: Many external and internal factors contribute to the complexity of PAD management including the attitudes of nursing staff towards PAD. The themes emerged from this study suggested the need of a multifaceted and multidisciplinary quality improvement programme to optimise the management of PAD in the ICU.",0
191,"OBJECTIVE: Sedation is one of the most common practices applied in the intensive care units (ICUs), and the management of sedation, analgesia and delirium is a quality measure in the ICUs. Several guidelines on sedation had been published, and many surveys investigated the practices of sedation in the ICUs, but knowledge on the sedation practices in Turkey is lacking. The aim of the present study was to provide baseline knowledge on the sedation practices and preferences of Turkish intensive care physicians and to establish some points to be improved. METHODS: An electronic survey form consisting of 34 questions was generated and posted to email addresses. The survey included questions about demographics and practices on sedation, analgesia, neuromuscular blockage and delirium. RESULTS: Of 1700 email addresses, 429 (25.0%) were returned. Sedation was practised by 98.0% of the respondents, and mechanical ventilation was indicated as the primary indication (94.0%) for sedation. The presence of a written sedation protocol was 37.0%. For drug choices for sedation, midazolam was the most preferred agent (90.0%). With regard to pain questions, the most commonly used evaluation tool was Visual Analogue Scale (69.0%), and the most preferred drug was tramadol. Nearly half of the participants routinely evaluated delirium and used the confusion assessment method in the ICU. CONCLUSION: The results of this survey have indicated some areas to be improved, and a national guideline should be prepared taking pain, agitation and delirium in focus.

192,"TOPIC: Protecting patient safety and preventing modifiable complications after acute ischemic stroke. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in adults. Stroke survivors often experience a variety of deficits related to mobility, nutrition, immunity, mood, and cognition. These post-stroke complications and residual effects can adversely affect safety, placing the patient at risk for further injury. In order to develop a plan of care that protects patient safety, critical care and progressive care nurses must understand the unique needs of this patient population. PURPOSE: To describe selected ischemic stroke-related physiological changes, how these changes contribute to safety risks, and methods of enhancing patient safety. CONTENT COVERED: Stroke physiology and stroke-specific interventions that can enable nurses to reduce the risk of falls, dysphagia, malnutrition, dehydration, altered glucose metabolism, device-related infections, aspiration pneumonia, delirium, and depression.",0
193,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore: the exposure of healthcare workers to a delirium guidelines implementation programme; effects on guideline adherence at intensive care unit (ICU) level; impact on knowledge and barriers, and experiences with the implementation. DESIGN: A mixed-methods process evaluation of a prospective multicentre implementation study. SETTING: Six ICUs. PARTICIPANTS: 4449 adult ICU patients and 500 ICU professionals approximately. INTERVENTION: A tailored implementation programme. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Adherence to delirium guidelines recommendations at ICU level before, during and after implementation; knowledge and perceived barriers; and experiences with the implementation. RESULTS: Five of six ICUs were exposed to all implementation strategies as planned. More than 85% followed the required e-learnings; 92% of the nurses attended the clinical classroom lessons; five ICUs used all available implementation strategies and perceived to have implemented all guideline recommendations (>90%). Adherence to predefined performance indicators (PIs) at ICU level was only above the preset target (>85%) for delirium screening. For all other PIs, the inter-ICU variability was between 34% and 72%. The implementation of delirium guidelines was feasible and successful in resolving the majority of barriers found before the implementation. The improvement was well sustained 6 months after full guideline implementation. Knowledge about delirium was improved (from 61% to 65%). The implementation programme was experienced as very successful. CONCLUSIONS: Multifaceted implementation can improve and sustain adherence to delirium guidelines, is feasible and can largely be performed as planned. However, variability in delirium guideline adherence at individual ICUs remains a challenge, indicating the need for more tailoring at centre level.",0
194,"Frailty is an aging-related, multisystem clinical state characterized by loss of physiological reserves and diminished capacity to withstand exposure to stressors. Frailty increases the risk of serious adverse outcomes, compared with that of nonfrail people of the same age. Adverse outcomes can be severe and may include procedural complications, delirium, significant functional decline and disability, prolonged hospital length of stay, extended recovery periods, and death. As older adults make up a continually growing proportion of hospitalized patients, critical care nurses need to understand how to recognize frailty and be familiar with related clinical practice implications. Such knowledge underpins effective organization and delivery of care strategies aimed at minimizing harm and maximizing positive outcomes for frail older adults. Drawing from recent literature, this article explores frailty and critical illness by discussing 2 dominant models of the concept. Using a clinical case study, links between frailty and critical care nursing practices are highlighted and clinical considerations are explored.",0
195,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that nurses have a crucial role in the recognition of delirium; however, they have insufficient knowledge regarding the issue. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to determine the knowledge level of cardiovascular surgery nurses regarding delirium. METHODS: A survey design was used. The population of the study consisted of 124 nurses employed at the cardiovascular surgery wards and intensive care units of universities as well as state and private hospitals located in two different cities in Turkey between May and June 2014. The sample consisted of 97 nurses employed at the aforementioned institutions and time. Data were collected using the questionnaire form depicting the demographic characteristics of the nurses and the knowledge form including the level of nurses' knowledge regarding delirium. For the evaluation of data, number, percentage, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U- and independent-samples t-test were used. RESULTS: Nurses were between 18 and 47 years of age with a mean 29·8 (SD = 6·80, the youngest = 18 and the oldest = 47) years. They spent a minimum of 1, a maximum of 25 and a median value of 3 (interquartile range, IQR: 5) years working in cardiovascular surgery. As for the scores received from the knowledge form regarding delirium, the lowest was zero, the highest was 60, and the average score was 41·18 ± 12·50 (a moderate level of knowledge). It was found that the nurses working in intensive care units, those who were chief nurses and those who received in-service training scored higher than the others. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular surgery nurses had a moderate level of knowledge regarding delirium. This may result in the neglect of delirium or a misdiagnosis. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is recommended that training is provided that includes recognition, assessment and application of appropriate interventions to minimise the incidence of delirium.",0
196,"BACKGROUND: Delirium in critically ill patients has a strong adverse impact on prognosis. In spite of its recognized importance, however, delirium screening and treatment procedures are often not in accordance with current guidelines. This implementation study is designed to assess barriers and facilitators for guideline adherence and next to develop a multifaceted tailored implementation strategy. Effects of this strategy on guideline adherence as well as important clinical outcomes will be described. METHODS: Current practices and guideline deviations will be assessed in a prospective baseline measurement. Barriers and facilitators will be identified from a survey among intensive care health care professionals (intensivists and nurses) and focus group interviews with selected health care professionals (n=60). Findings will serve as a foundation for a tailored guideline implementation strategy. Adherence to the guideline and effects of the implementation strategies on relevant clinical outcomes will be piloted in a before-after study in six intensive care units (ICUs) in the southwest Netherlands. The primary outcomes are adherence to screening and treatment in line with the Dutch ICU delirium guideline. Secondary outcomes are process measures (e.g. attendance to training and knowledge) and clinical outcomes (e.g. incidence of delirium, hospital-mortality changes, and length of stay). Primary and secondary outcome data will be collected at four time points including at least 924 patients. Furthermore, a process evaluation will be done, including an economical evaluation. DISCUSSION: Little is known on effective implementation of delirium management in the critically ill. The proposed multifaceted implementation strategy is expected to improve process measures such as screening adherence in line with the guideline and may improve clinical outcomes, such as mortality and length of stay. This ICU Delirium in Clinical Practice Implementation Evaluation study (iDECePTIvE-study) will generate important knowledge for ICU health care providers on how to improve their clinical practice to establish optimum care for delirious patients.

197,"Delirium can have serious consequences in terms of morbidity, mortality, and increased health care costs. An extensive literature review showed that delirium is not well understood, recognized, or managed by medical and nursing professionals. The goal for this study was to determine the level of knowledge and management skills among critical care nurses caring for patients with delirium who were treated in intensive care units (ICUs) in Jordan. A total of 232 critical care nurses, employed in different ICUs in Jordan, completed self-reported questionnaires. The nurses in critical care units who completed the questionnaires identified a need for more delirium-specific knowledge and skills to assess and manage this condition more effectively. To enhance health outcomes for patients treated in the ICU who have delirium, nurses need to receive education on current assessment and management modalities. These regular education programs should be complemented with evaluative research focusing on both nursing care and patient outcomes.",0
198,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common manifestation in the intensive care unit (ICU) that is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Guidelines suggested appropriate management of pain, agitation and delirium (PAD) is crucial in improving patient outcomes. However, the practice of PAD assessment and management in community hospitals is unclear and the mechanisms contributing to the potential care gap are unknown. OBJECTIVES: This quality improvement initiative aimed to review the practice of PAD assessment and management in a community medical-surgical ICU (MSICU) and to explore the community MSICU nurses' perceived comfort and satisfaction with PAD management in order to understand the mechanisms of the observed care gap and to inform subsequent quality improvement interventions. METHODS: We prospectively collected basic demographic data, clinical information and daily data on PAD process measures including PAD assessment and target Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score ordered by intensivists on all patients admitted to a community MSICU for >24 hours over a 20-week period. All ICU nurses in the same community MSICU were invited to participate in an anonymous survey. RESULTS: We collected data on a total of 1101 patient-days (PD). 653 PD (59%), 861 PD (78%) and 439 PD (39%) had PAD assessment performed, respectively. Target RASS was ordered by the intensivists on 515 PD (47%). Our nurse survey revealed that 88%, 85% and 41% of nurses were comfortable with PAD assessment, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium assessment was not routinely performed. This is partly explained by the discomfort nurses felt towards conducting delirium assessment. Our results suggested that improvement in nurse comfort with delirium assessment and management is needed in the community MSICU setting.",0
199,"BACKGROUND: The ABCDE bundle is a multifaceted, interprofessional intervention that is associated with reduced ventilator and delirium days as well as increased likelihood of mobility in intensive care. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe organizational domains that contribute to variation in ABCDE bundle implementation as reported by intensive care unit providers and to examine the capability of a conceptual framework for identifying variation in ABCDE bundle implementation. METHODS: We conducted 2 separate focus groups that included nurses, respiratory therapists, occupational and physical therapists (N = 16) from the surgical and medical intensive care units at 1 academic medical center. All participants had experience performing ABCDE bundle activities. RESULTS: Variation in how the ABCDE bundle was interpreted and executed within and across disciplines was noted. Organizational facets, the physical environment, labor quantity and quality, task burden, provider attitudes, and patient characteristics were noted to influence ABCDE bundle execution. The difficulty coordinating and implementing early mobility was emphasized. DISCUSSION: The number of disciplines required to perform an activity and individual component complexity was reported to influence ABCDE bundle implementation. Nurses repeatedly described challenges with coordinating care across disciplines. Small tests of change, adequate staffing, interprofessional training and protocol development efforts, and role modeling may be effective methods for successful ABCDE bundle implementation.",0
200,"BACKGROUND: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) delirium is a nonspecific, potentially preventable, and often reversible disorder of impaired cognition, which results from various causes in ICU patients. For appropriate management of delirium, early identification and risk factor assessment are key factors. Multidisciplinary collaboration and standardized care can enhance the recognition of delirium. DESIGN: In this study, authors used the exploratory and descriptive study method. METHOD: The study was conducted in a group of 45 nurses of the cardiac intensive care unit. The department has 16 intensive care stations and is intended for patients after cardiac surgery who require intensive care in the postoperative period. RESULTS: During the analysis the interviews, five Collective Subject Discourses were distinguished: signs and symptoms, physical restraint, use of sedatives, environment, and lack of education. CONCLUSION: Nurses have no knowledge of the factors contributing to the development of delirium, are unable to communicate with such patients and, most of all, do not know the consequences of the actions taken.",0
201,"OBJECTIVES: Delirium in critically ill patients is common and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Routine delirium screening is recommended by the Society of Critical Care Medicine. The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) is one validated and commonly-used tool, but little is known about nurses'perceptions of using the ICDSC, and of barriers to delirium assessment and treatment. DESIGN: A survey was administered to 189 critical care-trained nurses working on four oncology inpatient units, where the ICDSC has been used for greater than five years. RESULTS: Eighty-four nurses (44%) responded to the survey. Respondents indicated that they had knowledge of delirium, confidence in the ICDSC, and that the ICDSC was useful. Respondents perceived that physicians did not value the ICDSC results. Similar to prior nurse surveys for other delirium screening tools, physicians were the most frequently identified barrier to both delirium assessment and treatment, with other frequent barriers being lack of time, feedback on performance, and knowledge of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: The ICDSC is viewed favourably by nurses with experience using the tool. Future delirium screening programs should encourage physician engagement early in the planning process to help address perceived barriers to delirium assessment and treatment.",0
202,"Although most individuals prefer to die at home, approximately 60% of Americans die in the hospital setting. Nurses are inadequately prepared to provide end-of-life (EOL) care because of cure-focused education. Friends and family of dying patients report poor quality of death largely as a result of inadequate communication from health care professionals about the dying process. The purpose of this project was to improve nursing knowledge and comfort related to EOL care through use of the CARES tool and to improve the EOL experience of families of dying patients in the hospital setting through use of Final Journey. These acronym organized tools were developed based upon the common symptom management needs of the dying including Comfort, Airway, Restlessness and delirium, Emotional and spiritual support, and Self-care. The CARES tool for nurses improved nursing knowledge and comfort related to EOL care and common symptom management needs of the dying and also enhanced nurses' confidence in communicating about the dying process with friends and family. Final Journey, the friends and family version of the CARES tool, reinforced EOL information for friends and family, helped nurses answer difficult questions, and promoted and enhanced communication between health care professionals and friends and family of the dying.",0
203,"BACKGROUND: Nurses are usually the first to identify delirium in ICU patients. We aimed to assess the attitudes of Australian critical care nurses when we introduced the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). METHODS: We surveyed all 174 nurses in our ICU using two questionnaires: first after a one-month period of mandated but unstructured delirium assessments, and then following one month of CAM-ICU assessments. We also quantified antipsychotic medication usage by inspecting pharmacy records. FINDINGS: The first survey response rate was 65/174 (37%). Most nurses (73%) thought active delirium assessment was important, and 93% thought their assessments were worth the time required. These assessments were largely unstructured, as only 20% knew a formal delirium test, and only 7% sometimes used one. The second survey response rate was 45/174 (26%). Most (89%) still thought delirium assessment was important, but only 75% thought the CAM-ICU worth the time required (p=0.01 compared to unstructured assessments). Similar proportions (75% and 73%) were confident in the accuracy of their assessments. Many (33%) found the CAM-ICU 'quite' or 'very' hard to perform, but despite this, 82% wanted to continue to use it. Free-text answers suggested this was because medical staff paid more attention to the CAM-ICU. Supporting this, prescriptions of antipsychotic medications increased significantly in the CAM-ICU period. CONCLUSION: Critical care nurses in our Australian ICU who responded to our survey think delirium assessment is important. Although they find unstructured assessments easier to perform, they wanted to persist with the CAM-ICU, in part because it facilitated more appropriate pharmacological treatment of delirium for their patients. We recommend the CAM-ICU as a tool to improve communication between nurses and physicians in the management of delirium.",0
204,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged neurologists since its early days. Neurology consultation services were then overloaded by emergency department and intensive-care patients with acute neurological syndromes. These complications are better explained today, but the growing number of patients with reported longstanding neurological symptoms constitute an emerging, complex, and still poorly understood phenomenon. OBJECTIVE: This review summarizes data on relevant neurological manifestations of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and lasting post-infectious disease, also known as Long COVID. The complex history of Long COVID is examined to illustrate the upsides and challenges imposed by the active participation of patient communities in the production of medical knowledge. METHODS: Narrative review. RESULTS: Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is associated with encephalopathy/delirium, cerebrovascular disease, headache, and peripheral nervous system involvement. Long COVID is a living concept jointly defined by patient communities, physicians and scientists, including neurologists. CONCLUSION: Co-production of Long COVID knowledge between scientists and patients has initiated an era of patient-led research and evidence-based activism that acts as a two-edged sword - putting patient's suffering in the spotlight, but with a tradeoff in methodological consistency.",0
205,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and poorly diagnosed cause of behavioral change in elderly. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence, diagnostic accuracy and factors associated with the onset of delirium in the elderly admitted to an urgency unit. METHODS: Cross-sectional study including clinically stable subjects aged ≥60 years between April and June of 2014. Diagnosis of delirium based on the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM, gold standard) was compared to the subjective assessment made by physicians on duty as recorded in the medical chart. Association of sociodemographic, psychological/behavioural, and clinical variables with delirium was assessed using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A sample of 110 participants with a mean age of 72.7 ± 8.3 years was studied. Of these, 56.4% were men and 28.2% had a diagnosis of delirium on CAM. Significant associations were observed between delirium and male gender (P-value = 0.019), poor or very poor self-perception of health (P-value = 0.033), previous diagnosis of dementia (P-value = 0.001), previous history of stroke (P-value = 0.014), and acute bacterial infection (P-value = 0.008). Physician diagnosis had a sensitivity of 35.5%, specificity of 100%, and accuracy of 81.8% to detect delirium. Rate of misdiagnosis was 64.5%. CONCLUSION: Delirium was underdiagnosed in this urgent care hospital setting.",0
206,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a library of delirium-suggestive words. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Single tertiary referral hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Medical, nursing and allied health staff and medical coders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of graded response on a 5-point Likert scale to individual delirium-suggestive words. RESULTS: Two-hundred and three complete responses were received from 227 survey respondents; the majority were medical and nursing staff (42.4% and 43.8% respectively), followed by allied health practitioners and medical coders (10.3% and 3.4%). Words that were ""very likely"" to suggest delirium were ""confused/ confusion"", ""delirious"", ""disoriented/disorientation"" and ""fluctuating conscious state"". Differences in word selection were noted based on occupational background, prior knowledge of delirium, and experience in caring for intensive care unit patients. Distractor words included in the survey were rated as ""unlikely"" or ""very unlikely"" by respondents as expected. Textual responses identified several other descriptors of delirium-suggestive words. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive repertoire of delirium-suggestive words was validated using a multidisciplinary survey and new words suggested by respondents were added. The use of natural language processing algorithms may allow for earlier detection of delirium using our delirium library and be deployed for real-time decision making and clinical care.",0
207,"The purpose of this project was to determine if bedside intensive care unit (ICU) nurse buy-in to the Family Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) protocol was sufficient to make implementation feasible at one county hospital in West Texas. Surveys were anonymous with ballot box collection being available to the bedside ICU nurses for one week each. Questions were based on literature findings of expected outcomes, identified barriers and facilitators, Calgary Family Intervention Method framework domains, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Framework for program evaluation. Outcome measures were taken from the stated aims of the project and evaluated from paired baseline and summative survey questions. Survey participation was approximately half of nurses employed in the studied ICU. Analysis of the surveys showed a positive perception of family presence decreasing patient delirium symptoms, and a positive perception of the Family HELP protocol. The results described a high perception of family members as partners in care and high intention to implement the Family HELP protocol, indicating strong support of a full implementation of the protocol. The high level of bedside nurse buy-in present in this study has large implications for successful implementation of the Family HELP protocol in the near future, with sustainability and continued use supported by potential inclusion of the task in the electronic health record charting.",0
208,"BACKGROUND: Updated knowledge of the palliative care (PC) literature is needed to maintain competency and best address the PC needs of hospitalized patients. We critiqued the recent PC literature with the highest potential to impact hospital practice. METHODS: We reviewed articles published between January 2016 and December 2016, which were identified through a handsearch of leading journals and a MEDLINE search. The final 9 articles selected were determined by consensus based on scientific rigor, relevance to hospital medicine, and impact on practice. RESULTS: Key findings include the following: scheduled antipsychotics were inferior to a placebo for nonterminal delirium; a low-dose morphine was superior to a weak opioid for moderate cancer pain; methadone as a coanalgesic improved high-intensity cancer pain; many hospitalized patients on comfort care still receive antimicrobials; video decision aids improved the rates of advance care planning (ACP) and hospice use and decreased costs; standardized, PC-led intervention did not improve psychological outcomes in families of patients with a chronic critical illness; caregivers of patients surviving a prolonged critical illness experienced high and persistent rates of depression; people with non-normative sexuality or gender faced additional stressors with partner loss; and physician trainees experienced significant moral distress with futile treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Recent research provides important guidance for clinicians caring for hospitalized patients with serious illnesses, including symptom management, ACP, moral distress, and outcomes of critical illness.",0
209,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, its high transmissibility required infected individuals to be placed in negative pressure isolation rooms when admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Studies have shown that limited social support can increase the risk of developing delirium during ICU stays. Minimal research exists on COVID-19-associated ICU delirium as hospitals and government organizations focus on combating equipment shortages and case surges. Here, we present the case of a 64-year-old Filipino male with COVID-19 ICU delirium status post-intubation and ventilation. His hospital course was complicated by the medical staff's assumption that the patient spoke Spanish and improved after being assigned a Tagalog-speaking nurse who facilitated family communication. This case highlights the importance of cultural competency and communication in the management of COVID-19 associated ICU delirium. In particular, Filipino cultural practices and their intersection with healthcare in the larger context of providing culturally competent care are highlighted. The use of culturally competent care serves to assure the use of appropriate services and reduces the occurrence of medical errors due to misunderstandings caused by differences in language or culture. Familial involvement is critical for ICU delirium; however, the COVID-19 pandemic has required healthcare providers to think beyond conventional means. The use of technology to virtually communicate with family also serves as a helpful tool to treat signs of delirium. As seen in this case, a lack of understanding of the Filipino culture resulted in assumptions on the part of the healthcare provider which led to the prolongation of delirium in a COVID-19 ICU patient, but the correct utilization of cultural competence helped the patient recover successfully.",0
210,"In Korea, delirium risk screening has not been routinely implemented in intensive care units (ICUs). The purpose of this study was to implement an Automatic Prediction of Delirium in Intensive Care Units (APREDEL-ICU) system to investigate its impact on nursing-sensitive outcomes and to assess nurse satisfaction with the system. A pre-post research design was used. A total of 145 patients were involved prior to the system implementation and 172 were involved after implementation. Forty medical ICU nurses evaluated the system. The APREDEL-ICU system did not result in a reduction in the incidence of delirium. However, the nurses reported that their knowledge regarding delirium care increased after the system was introduced. The proposed system was successfully implemented without increasing the burden of nurses in their assessment of delirium risk. Long-term use of APREDEL-ICU could enhance preventive care and consequently result in positive patient outcomes.",0
211,"Delirium is an acute change in cognitive functioning, characterized by inattention and associated with alterations in awareness and fluctuation in arousal, disorganized thinking, or altered level that preferentially affects older adult patients. In the acutely ill cardiac patient, the incidence of delirium has been reported as high as 73%, depending on the type and sensitivity of delirium assessment. Cardiac patients with delirium experience higher rates of in-hospital and longer-term mortality and are at risk for progressive cognitive impairment, loss of functional independence, and increased hospitalization costs. As such, delirium represents an undesirable outcome in cardiac patients. Care improvements such as identifying risk of delirium at time of admission or in the preoperative setting; training cardiologist, surgeons, anaesthesiologists and nurses to screen for delirium; implementing delirium prevention programs; and developing standardized delirium treatment protocols might reduce the incidence of delirium and its associated morbidity.",0
212,"OBJECTIVE: to conduct an educational intervention with the nursing team members of an intensive care unit (ICU), aiming to increase knowledge and to introduce improvements in their practices regarding prevention and monitoring of delirium in older patients. METHOD: this is an action research, in which workshops were conducted with eleven nurses and a nursing technician from an ICU unit in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. RESULTS: ten problems regarding nursing practices for prevention and monitoring of delirium were identified. Educational, practical, technical, and managerial actions were planned, involving cross-sector connections for planning ways to solve these problems. The groups reported significant changes in the practices, with the implementation of drug-free measures for preventing and managing the situation. CONCLUSION: the educational intervention contributed to improve the nursing practices in the ICU unit studied, and it also favored the development of critical thinking about the problems mentioned, thus enabling permanent review of offered treatments.",0
213,"INTRODUCTION: Mobilising mechanically ventilated patients is safe and beneficial and improves outcomes. However, early mobilisation is not widely practiced and barriers to its implementation still exist. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess clinician perceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours towards mobilising critically ill ventilated patients in the intensive care unit, as well as perceived barriers and facilitators towards mobilisation. METHODS: A prospective questionnaire based on three existing questionnaires was administered to nurses, physicians, and physiotherapists from a single mixed medical/surgical intensive care unit in an Australian tertiary hospital. The 32-item questionnaire focused on knowledge, attitudes, behaviour, and perceived facilitators and barriers. Various response options were used, and data were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 56.6% (82 of 145). Overall, clinicians' knowledge score was 4.1 (standard deviation = 1.4) out of a possible score of 6. Early mobilisation was not perceived as a top priority by 40.2% of participants. One important facilitator was that majority of the participants perceived early mobilisation was important. The most common perceived barriers to early mobilisation were medical instability, delirium, sedation, and limited staffing. Clinicians' opinions varied on the timing and appropriateness for instituting early mobilisation. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians had various levels of knowledge on early mobilisation as a therapy for critically ill patients. Most clinicians believed that early mobility was important and were willing to reduce sedation; however, several key barriers were identified which need to be addressed by using targeted interventions. This will reduce or close the gap between knowledge and practice.",0
214,"Delirium in the hospitalized elderly patient is highly prevalent and has severe consequences. Critically ill elderly individuals are at particular risk for delirium because of impaired physical and mental defense mechanisms. More research in terms of etiology, detection, treatment, and especially prevention, needs to be done. Although nursing care and nursing research have contributed much to our current knowledge of this complex condition, more will be contributed toward its understanding and management during the next decade. It is imperative that nurses attempt to keep abreast of this progress to provide the quality and cost-effective care that can keep older patients ""on track.""",0
215,"Trauma patients experience pain and agitation during their hospitalization. Many complications have been noted both in the absence of symptom management and the in presence of oversedation/narcotization. To combat noted untoward effects of pain and sedation management, an interprofessional team convened to develop a pain and sedation guideline for use in a trauma intensive care unit. Guideline development began with a comprehensive review of the literature. With the input of unit stakeholders, a nurse-driven analgosedation guideline was implemented for a 6-month trial. During this time, unit champions were integral to successful trial execution. Outcome measurement included patient and unit outcomes, nursing satisfaction, and a pre- and postimplementation patient comparison. Following implementation, unit length of stay decreased by 4.16% and there was a 17.81% decrease in average time on the ventilator following the initiation of weaning. Patient reports of nurse sensitivity and responsiveness to pain increased from 93.7 to 94.9. Nurses reported satisfaction with the practice change and improvements in care. In comparing pre- and postimplementation patient data, there was a significant decrease in mean analgesic treatment duration and an increase in the use of antipsychotics for delirium management. Following the trial period, this guideline was permanently adopted across the adult critical care service. The development of a nurse-driven analgosedation guideline was noted to be both feasible and successful.",0
216,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a frequently encountered syndrome that negatively impacts on the well-being of the critically ill patient. Although international guidelines promote delirium monitoring, little is known regarding Irish intensive care (ICU) nurses' opinions and current practice in relation to delirium monitoring. AIM: To ascertain ICU nurses' opinions on delirium among the critically ill and establish if delirium monitoring is part of current practice in the Republic of Ireland. METHODS: A descriptive quantitative survey design was employed, utilising a self-report questionnaire. Participants were registered nurses selected using convenience sampling from two of the largest and leading teaching hospitals in the Republic of Ireland. The overall response rate was 70% (n=151/216). FINDINGS: The majority of participants 143 (95%) recognised delirium as a serious problem and 93% considered delirium to be an under-diagnosed syndrome that requires active medical intervention. Only 17.9% reported screening for delirium and 4% ranked delirium important to monitor in the ICU setting. The majority of participants never attended a lecture (79%) or read an article (68%) pertaining to delirium. CONCLUSION: The findings provide further evidence of the theory practice gap that is likely to exist internationally in settings where best practice guidelines on the management of delirium in the ICU setting are not implemented.",0
217,"BACKGROUND: Delirium frequently occurs among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). There is limited evidence to support interventions to treat or resolve delirium in patients who have already developed delirium. Therefore, the early recognition and prevention of delirium are important in the management of critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and validate a delirium prediction model within 24 hours of admission to the ICU using electronic health record data. The algorithm was named the Prediction of ICU Delirium (PRIDE). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study performed at a tertiary referral hospital with 120 ICU beds. We only included patients who were 18 years or older at the time of admission and who stayed in the medical or surgical ICU. Patients were excluded if they lacked a Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU record from the day of ICU admission or if they had a positive Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU record at the time of ICU admission. The algorithm to predict delirium was developed using patient data from the first 2 years of the study period and validated using patient data from the last 6 months. Random forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), deep neural network (DNN), and logistic regression (LR) were used. The algorithms were externally validated using MIMIC-III data, and the algorithm with the largest area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve in the external data set was named the PRIDE algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 37,543 cases were collected. After patient exclusion, 12,409 remained as our study population, of which 3816 (30.8%) patients experienced delirium incidents during the study period. Based on the exclusion criteria, out of the 96,016 ICU admission cases in the MIMIC-III data set, 2061 cases were included, and 272 (13.2%) delirium incidents occurred. The average AUROCs and 95% CIs for internal validation were 0.916 (95% CI 0.916-0.916) for RF, 0.919 (95% CI 0.919-0.919) for XGBoost, 0.881 (95% CI 0.878-0.884) for DNN, and 0.875 (95% CI 0.875-0.875) for LR. Regarding the external validation, the best AUROC were 0.721 (95% CI 0.72-0.721) for RF, 0.697 (95% CI 0.695-0.699) for XGBoost, 0.655 (95% CI 0.654-0.657) for DNN, and 0.631 (95% CI 0.631-0.631) for LR. The Brier score of the RF model is 0.168, indicating that it is well-calibrated. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning approach based on electronic health record data can be used to predict delirium within 24 hours of ICU admission. RF, XGBoost, DNN, and LR models were used, and they effectively predicted delirium. However, with the potential to advise ICU physicians and prevent ICU delirium, prospective studies are required to verify the algorithm's performance.",0

219,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To survey intensive care unit healthcare professionals' awareness and practice related to delirium. BACKGROUND: Despite the current evidence revealing the risks linked to delirium and advances in practice guidelines promoting delirium assessment, healthcare professionals show little sensitivity towards delirium and evident training needs. DESIGN: The study had a cross-sectional survey design. METHODS: A sample of 168 intensive care unit healthcare professionals including nurses and physicians completed a semistructured questionnaire to survey their awareness, screening and management of delirium in intensive care units. The survey took place at 11 intensive care units from academic (university) and nonacademic (nonuniversity) governmental hospitals in Mansoura, Egypt. RESULTS: The mean score of delirium awareness was 64·4 ± 14·0 among intensive care unit healthcare professionals. Awareness of delirium was significantly lower when definition of delirium was not provided, among diploma nurses compared to bachelor degree nurses and physicians, among those who did not attend any workshop/lecture or read an article related to delirium and lastly, those who work in an intensive care unit when <50% of patients develop delirium. The survey found that only 26·8% of the healthcare professionals screen for delirium on a routine basis, and 14·3% reported attending workshops or lectures or reading an article related to delirium in the last year. In screening delirium, healthcare professionals did not use any tools, nor did they follow adopted protocols or guidelines to manage delirium. To manage delirium, 52·4% of the participants reported using sedatives, 36·9% used no drugs, and 10·7% reported using antipsychotics (primarily haloperidol). CONCLUSION: Intensive care unit healthcare professionals do not have adequate training or routine screening of delirium. There is an evident absence of using standardised tools or adapting protocols to monitor and manage delirium. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study has the potentials to shed some lights on the variables that might explain the problem of underdiagnosing delirium by healthcare professionals at intensive care units in Mansoura.",0
220,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a frequently missed diagnosis in the intensive care unit (ICU). Implementation of the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) may improve recognition of delirium. However, the ICU team may be reluctant to adopt daily assessment by a screening tool. This report focusses on the obstacles and barriers encountered with respect to organisational context and prevailing opinions and attitudes when implementing the CAM-ICU in daily practice in a Dutch ICU. METHODS: A structured implementation process was set up comprising four phases: (1) assessing the current situation to understand behaviour towards delirium; (2) the identification of barriers to the implementation of the CAM-ICU; (3) preparation of the ICU team for a change in attitude; and (4) evaluation of the effects of implementation. RESULTS: Phase 1 demonstrated that there was no delirium protocol available; it was left to the attending physicians when and how to diagnose delirium in each individual patient. In addition, nurses acted on delirium in a non-structured way; nurses thought implementation of the CAM-ICU would be very time-consuming and would not add to their ability in recognising delirium. In Phase 2, several barriers to implementation were addressed. Firstly, all nurses had to be convinced that delirium is an important problem and, secondly, logistics had to be put in place, for example, picture cards at every bedside, communication between daily nurses and a delirium working group had to be improved. In Phase 3, 10 nurses were educated to perform the CAM-ICU through several training sessions which included videos to illustrate different delirium states; these trained nurses educated all other nurses. A check box in the daily records was introduced to denote whether the CAM-ICU had been performed. In Phase 4, after a training period and 2 months of actual routine bedside CAM-ICU performance, evaluation demonstrated that frequency of assessments on un-sedated patients had increased from 38% to 95% per nursing shift. A short survey amongst the ICU nurses also showed that awareness of delirium and appreciation of the clinical problem had markedly increased. CONCLUSION: Implementation of the CAM-ICU in daily critical care is feasible. A structural training programme is probably helpful for success of implementation.",0
221,"INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a common complication of patients hospitalized in Intensive care units (ICU). The risk of delirium is estimated at approximately 80% in intensive care units. In the case of cardiac surgery ICU, the risk of delirium increases due to the type of procedures performed with the use of extracorporeal circulation. The aim of this study was to provide an official translation and evaluation of Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC) into Polish. The NuDESC scale is a scale used by nurses around the world to detect delirium at an early stage in treatment. METHODS: The method used in the study was the NuDESC tool, which was translated into Polish. The study was conducted by Cardiac ICU nurses during day shift (at 8 a.m.), night shift (at 8 p.m.) and in other situations where the patients showed delirium-like symptoms. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed between the first and second day in the studied group of patients in the case of illusions/hallucinations. Delirium occurred more frequently during the night, but statistical significance was demonstrated for both daytime and nighttime shifts. It was not demonstrated in relation to the NuDESC scale in the case of insomnia disorders. The diagnosis of delirium and disorientation was the most common diagnosis observed in patients on the first day of their stay in the ICU, followed by problems with communication. Delirium occurred on the first day, mainly at night. On the second day, delirium was much less frequent during the night; the biggest problem was disorientation and problems with communication. CONCLUSION: This study contributed to the development of the Polish version of the scale (NuDESC PL) which is now used as the Polish screening tool for delirium detection. The availability of an easy-to-use nurse-based delirium instrument is a prerequisite for widespread implementation.",0
222,"BACKGROUND: The ABCDE (Awakening and Breathing coordination of daily sedation and ventilator removal trials; Choice of sedative or analgesic exposure; Delirium monitoring and management; and Early mobility and exercise) bundle is a multidisciplinary set of evidence-based practices for improving patient outcomes in the intensive care unit. Nurses are critical to all the bundle's requirements. Therefore, understanding their knowledge, attitudes, and perception of the different bundle's components might help for an easier implementation into everyday clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess nurses' knowledge, utility, and perception of the ABCDE bundle. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire with closed-end questions was administered to the nurses working at the intensive care unit (ICU) of a nationwide teaching hospital. RESULTS: Only the 41.6% of the respondents declared to be aware of the bundle; however, the majority of them (67%) agreed with its potential capability of improving patients' outcomes after reviewing a document as they completed a survey. In addition, 71% of responders judged the Sedation Awakening Trial and the Spontaneous Breathing Trial easy to understand, and 80% found the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU useful to asses and monitor delirium. However, 48% reported that they did not currently use them. Fifty-one percent of respondents reported that they were not aware of or had used the Exercise/Mobility Safety Screen. Fifty-three respondents reported that multidisciplinary rounds were not performed at their ICU but judged them as a positive activity. Only 34% of the respondents considered the ABCDE bundle applicable at their own ICU. DISCUSSION: A substantial need for educational improvement and cultural change is needed. The results of this study may help other facilities to identify contextual and professionals-related factors possibly hindering the bundle's implementation.",0
223,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is prevalent in palliative care inpatient settings and management is often challenging. Despite nurses' integral patient care role, little is known about palliative care nurses' capacity to recognise, assess and respond to patients' delirium symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences, views and practices of inpatient palliative care nurses in delirium recognition and assessment. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: 30 nurses from nine Australian specialist palliative care inpatient services. DESIGN AND METHODS: Critical incident technique (CIT) guided a series of semi-structured interviews. Prior to interviews participants were given a vignette of a palliative care inpatient with an unrecognised hypoactive delirium, to prompt their recollection and recounting of a similar clinical incident. Clearly recalled and described incidents were analysed using thematic content analysis. FINDINGS: 20 of 30 participants recalled and described 28 relevant delirium incidents. Two themes and six sub-themes provide a general description of participants' experiences, views and practice in delirium recognition and assessment. Participants experience distress related to caring for patients with delirium and express compassion and empathy for delirious patients. Enhancing their delirium knowledge, strengthening collaborative multidisciplinary team relationships and better communication are important supports. Some participants, usually those in advance practice roles, describe more comprehensive assessment capabilities that incorporate clinical expertise with whole person awareness, yet systematic and structured delirium screening and assessment processes and application of the delirium diagnosis criteria are largely missing. Use of ambiguous terminology to describe delirium symptoms contributes to ineffective practice. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study expands our understanding of how palliative care nurses' capacity to recognise and assess patients' delirium symptoms in the inpatient setting could be strengthened.",0
224,"As the United States population ages, patients in intensive care units (ICUs) bring with them the challenges of an aging population. One challenge is the different types of confusions seen in the geriatric patient. Intensive care unit nurses must be knowledgeable about the different types of confusions, be able to differentiate among them, and know the appropriate prevention and management strategies for each type. Failure to do so results in consequences that impact the patient long after the ICU stay had ended. The purpose of this article was to differentiate between the 3 most common confusions among older adults--delirium, dementia, and depression. In addition, this article discusses confusion seen postoperatively and post-ICU stay.",0
225,"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of delirium in the intensive care unit is high, although it may differ according to the specific characteristics of the unit. Despite the rapid development of research on delirium in recent years, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the clinical presentation of delirium are still subject to hypotheses. The aim of this review was to describe the incidence of delirium in cardiac arrest survivors and the clinical impact of delirium on patient outcomes. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted in the second quarter of 2022. The number of articles retrieved during each search test was limited to studies conducted between 2010 and 2020. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The last search was conducted in May 2022. RESULTS: A total of 537 records was initially obtained from the databases. After discarding duplicates, selecting titles and abstracts, and then analyzing full-text articles, 7 studies met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of delirium in the cardiac arrest survivor population ranged from 8% to as high as 100%. The length of stay in ICU and hospital was significantly longer in patients with delirium than those without. Ninety-eight percent of patients had cognitive or perceptual impairment and psychomotor impairment. Of the seven studies included in the analysis, the RASS, CAM, and NuDesc scales were used to diagnose delirium. Potential risk factors that may influence the duration of delirium include age and time since resuscitation; propofol use shortened the duration of delirium. CONCLUSION: the incidence of delirium in ICU patients who survived CA is high. Cardiac arrest is an additional predisposing factor for delirium. In cardiac arrest survivors, the occurrence of delirium prolongs the duration of ICU and hospital stay and adversely affects functional outcomes. The most common type of delirium among this population was hypoactive delirium. A large percentage of patients manifested symptoms such as cognitive or perception impairment, psychomotor impairment, and impaired concentration and attention.",0
226,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is common among critically ill patients, leading to increased mortality, physical dependence, and cognitive impairment. Evidence suggests non-pharmacological delirium prevention practices are effective in preventing delirium. However, only a few studies explore the actual implementation and its associated challenges among critical care nurses. AIM: To explore critical care nurses' perceptions of current non-pharmacological delirium prevention practices in adult intensive care settings, including delirium screening, early mobilisation, sleep promotion, family engagement, and sensory stimulation. METHODS: A qualitative design adopting a thematic analysis approach. Semi-structured interviews with 20 critical care nurses were conducted in ten acute hospitals in mainland China. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: (a) importance of family engagement; (b) influence of organisational factors, and (c) suggestions on implementation. The implementation of non-pharmacological delirium prevention practices was limited by a strict ICU visitation policy, lack of routine delirium screening and delirium training, light and noise disturbances during nighttime hours, frequent resuscitation and new admissions and strict visitation policy. Case-based training, adopting a sensory stimulation protocol, and family engagement may be enablers. CONCLUSION: ICU care routine that lacks delirium assessment and the strict family visitation policy made it challenging to implement the complete bundle of non-pharmacological practices. Resource deficiency (understaffing, lack of training) and ICU environment (frequent resuscitation) also limited the implementation of non-pharmacological practices. Clinicians could implement case-based training and sensory-stimulation programs and improve communication with family caregivers by instructing family caregivers to recognise delirium symptoms and delirium prevention strategies.",0
227,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature on relationships between characteristics of the nurse work environment and five nurse-sensitive patient outcomes in hospitals. DATA SOURCES: The search was performed in Medline (PubMed), Cochrane, Embase, and CINAHL. REVIEW METHODS: Included were quantitative studies published from 2004 to 2012 that examined associations between work environment and the following patient outcomes: delirium, malnutrition, pain, patient falls and pressure ulcers. The Dutch version of Cochrane's critical appraisal instrument was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. RESULTS: Of the initial 1120 studies, 29 were included in the review. Nurse staffing was inversely related to patient falls; more favorable staffing hours were associated with fewer fall incidents. Mixed results were shown for nurse staffing in relation to pressure ulcers. Characteristics of work environment other than nurse staffing that showed significant effects were: (i) collaborative relationships; positively perceived communication between nurses and physicians was associated with fewer patient falls and lower rates of pressure ulcers, (ii) nurse education; higher levels of education were related to fewer patient falls and (iii) nursing experience; lower levels of experience were related to more patient falls and higher rates of pressure ulcers. No eligible studies were found regarding delirium and malnutrition, and only one study found that favorable staffing was related to better pain management. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that there is evidence on associations between work environment and nurse-sensitive patient outcomes. However, the results are equivocal and studies often do not provide clear conclusions. A quantitative meta-analysis was not feasible due to methodological issues in the primary studies (for example, poorly described samples). The diversity in outcome measures and the majority of cross-sectional designs make quantitative analysis even more difficult. In the future, well-described research designs of a longitudinal character will be needed in this field of work environment and nursing quality.",0
228,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe how pediatric cardiac intensive care clinicians assess and manage delirium in patients following cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Descriptive self-report survey. SETTING: A web-based survey of pediatric cardiac intensive care clinicians who are members of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society. PATIENT OR SUBJECTS: Pediatric cardiac intensive care clinicians (physicians and nurses). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: One-hundred seventy-three clinicians practicing in 71 different institutions located in 13 countries completed the survey. Respondents described their clinical impression of the occurrence of delirium to be approximately 25%. Most respondents (75%) reported that their ICU does not routinely screen for delirium. Over half of the respondents (61%) have never attended a lecture on delirium. The majority of respondents (86%) were not satisfied with current delirium screening, diagnosis, and management practices. Promotion of day/night cycle, exposure to natural light, deintensification of care, sleep hygiene, and reorientation to prevent or manage delirium were among nonpharmacologic interventions reported along with the use of anxiolytic, antipsychotic, and medications for insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians responding to the survey reported a range of delirium assessment and management practices in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgery patients. Study results highlight the need for improvement in delirium education for pediatric cardiac intensive care clinicians as well as the need for systematic evaluation of current delirium assessment and management practices.",0
229,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the implementation of an intensive care unit (ICU) diary in an Italian general ICU. METHODS: A mixed-methods pilot study was performed, enrolling all patients who received an ICU diary in an Italian ICU during the study period. RESULTS: Study results are presented in 2 sections: (1) diary evaluation and content themes and (2) follow-up program results. Sixty-six patients were assessed for eligibility. Diary administration was possible in 31 patients (47%). The overall diary entries, in 31 analyzed diaries, were 1331, with a median of 25 entries (interquartile range, 16-57 entries) for each diary. Participants' relatives and friends wrote a median of 1.2 (0.3-1.6), and nurses wrote 1.1 (0.8-1.2). Other ICU staff wrote a total of 24 entries (2%). Follow-up results revealed low incidence of delirium detected in only 1 patient at the 7-day visit (3%). The median value of PTSS-10 (Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms) score was 12 (3.5-12) at the 7-day visit, 6 (1.5-12) at 3 months' telephone interview, and 12 (1.5-17) at 6 months' visit. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first Italian report about the introduction of an ICU diary. The diaries were easily implemented in our clinical practice as a ""low-cost"" initiative. In our study, nurses and participants' relatives and friends wrote a similar number of entries in each analyzed diary. This project could be effective in reducing survivors' delirium and post-traumatic stress disorder and in implementing mutual understanding between clinical staff and relatives during ICU stay.",0
230,"BACKGROUND: Ineffective daytime nurse-physician communication in intensive care adversely affects patients' outcomes. Nurses' and physicians' communications and perceptions of this communication at night are unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine perceptions of nurses and physicians of their communication with each other at night in the intensive care unit about patients' pain, agitation, and delirium and to develop a qualitative survey instrument to investigate this topic. Methods A validated survey was distributed to nighttime nurses and physicians in 2 medical intensive care units. RESULTS: Most nurses (30/45; 67%) and physicians (56/75; 75%) responded. Nurses (35%) and physicians (31%) thought that a similar proportion of communications was related to pain, agitation, and delirium. Most nurses (70%) and physicians (80%) agreed that nurses used good judgment when paging physicians at night because of patients' pain, agitation, and delirium, but physicians (72%) were more likely than nurses (48%) to think that these pages did not portray the situation accurately (P = .004). For many text pages, physicians attributed a heightened level of urgency more often than did the nurses who sent the texts. Nurses often thought that physicians did not appreciate the urgency (33%) or complexity (33%) of the situations the nurses communicated via pages. More physicians (41%) than nurses (14%) agreed that nurses exceeded medication orders for pain, agitation, and delirium before contacting a physician (P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: Perceptual differences between physicians and nurses about nurse-physician communications at night regarding pain, agitation, and delirium were numerous and should be studied further.",0
231,"BACKGROUND: Delirium commonly affects hospitalized patients and is associated with increased hospital length of stay, discharge to skilled care, cost, morbidity, and mortality. LOCAL PROBLEM: At our organization, there was no formal delirium assessment performed by the nursing staff outside of the intensive care unit. METHODS: Assessment of nurses' knowledge about delirium, a nurse-driven delirium screening protocol, and patient education were implemented on an adult inpatient neurology unit. Knowledge change, protocol implementation, and patient-level outcomes were assessed. INTERVENTIONS: Staff nurse delirium education and a nurse-driven delirium screening protocol were implemented. RESULTS: No change in nursing knowledge occurred pre/postintervention. Falls, falls with injury, and restraint and sitter usage decreased. Changes in length of stay varied over the intervention period. The trend to discharge to home increased, while the trend to discharge to skilled nursing care decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Formal delirium screening protocols may add organizational value by positively impacting patient outcomes.",0
232,"CONTEXT: Based on the clinical care pathway of delirium in palliative care (PC), a published analytic framework (AF) formulated research questions in key domains and recommended a scoping review to identify evidence gaps. OBJECTIVES: To produce a literature map for key domains of the published AF: screening, prognosis and diagnosis, management, and the health-related outcomes. METHODS: A standard scoping review framework was used by an interdisciplinary study team of nurse- and physician-delirium researchers, an information specialist, and review methodologists to conduct the review. Knowledge user engagement provided context in refining 19 AF questions. A peer-reviewed search strategy identified citations in Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, and CINAHL databases between 1980 and 2018. Two reviewers independently screened records for inclusion using explicit study eligibility criteria for the population, design, delirium diagnosis, and investigational intent. RESULTS: Of 104 studies reporting empirical data and meeting eligibility criteria, most were conducted in patients with cancer (73.1%) and in inpatient PC units (52%). The most frequent study design was a one or more group, nonrandomized trial or cohort (67.3%). Evidence gaps were identified: delirium risk prediction; comparative effectiveness and harms of prevention, variability in delirium management across PC settings, advanced directive and substitute decision-maker input, and transition of care location; and estimating delirium reversibility. Future rigorous primary studies are required to address these gaps and preliminary concerns regarding the quality of extant literature. CONCLUSION: Substantial evidence gaps exist, providing opportunities for future research regarding the assessment, prognosis, and management of delirium in PC settings.",0
233,"Critically ill patients receiving palliative care at the end of life are at high risk for experiencing pain, dyspnea, and death rattle. Nearly all these patients are at risk for the development of delirium. Patients who are alert may experience anxiety. Advanced practice nurses and staff nurses are integral to detecting and treating these symptoms. Pain, dyspnea, and anxiety should be routinely assessed by patient self-report when possible. Routine behavioral screening for delirium is recommended. Behavioral observation tools to detect pain and dyspnea and proxy assessments guide symptom identification when the patient cannot provide a self-report. Evidence-based interventions are offered for both prevention and treatment of pain, dyspnea, anxiety, and delirium. Death rattle does not produce patient distress, and current pharmacological treatment lacks an evidence base. Pain management has a robust evidence base compared to management of dyspnea, anxiety, and delirium among this population; well-designed, adequately powered studies are needed.",0
235,"CONTEXT: Delirium is underrecognized by nurses, including those working in palliative care settings where the syndrome occurs frequently. Identifying contextual factors that support and/or hinder palliative care nurses' delirium recognition and assessment capabilities is crucial, to inform development of clinical practice and systems aimed at improving patients' delirium outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to identify nurses' perceptions of the barriers and enablers to recognizing and assessing delirium symptoms in palliative care inpatient settings. METHODS: A series of semistructured interviews, guided by critical incident technique, were conducted with nurses working in Australian palliative care inpatient settings. A hypoactive delirium vignette prompted participants' recall of delirium and identification of the perceived factors (barriers and enablers) that impacted on their delirium recognition and assessment capabilities. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. RESULTS: Thirty participants from nine palliative care services provided insights into the barriers and enablers of delirium recognition and assessment in the inpatient setting that were categorized as patient and family, health professional, and system level factors. Analysis revealed five themes, each reflecting both identified barriers and current and/or potential enablers: 1) value in listening to patients and engaging families, 2) assessment is integrated with care delivery, 3) respecting and integrating nurses' observations, 4) addressing nurses' delirium knowledge needs, and 5) integrating delirium recognition and assessment processes. CONCLUSION: Supporting the development of palliative care nursing delirium recognition and assessment practice requires attending to a range of barriers and enablers at the patient and family, health professional, and system levels.",0
236,"BACKGROUND: Patients in intensive care units who develop delirium, experience longer stay in intensive care as well as increased morbidity and mortality. A questionnaire in 2009 showed that there was no consensus in Denmark regarding the tools to be used to assess sedation or delirium, the patient groups they should be used in, or the frequency of assessment. AIMS: The aims of this survey were to describe clinical practice regarding the assessment of sedation and delirium in intensive care patients and to compare the results with those obtained in 2009. METHOD: A questionnaire was sent via e-mail to all intensive care units in Denmark caring for ventilated adult patients. An intensive care nurse with daily patient contact was asked to answer questions about the unit's practice regarding the tools used to assess sedation and delirium in adult patients. RESULTS: In all, 98% of the intensive care units responded. Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale was the most used tool for sedation assessment, and Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit was used only for delirium assessment. CONCLUSION: A shared language for sedation and delirium assessment was identified as essential in supporting care delivery. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A systematic use of a shared language according to sedation and delirium in intensive care units can minimize mistakes in transfer of patients and minimize the risk of doubly traumatising patients.",0
237,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to seek to understand the lived experience of intensive care nurses caring for patients with delirium. The objectives of this inquiry were: 1) To examine intensive care nurses' experiences of caring for adult patients with delirium; 2) To identify factors that facilitate or hinder intensive care nurses caring for these patients. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: This study utilised an interpretive phenomenological approach as described by van Manen. SETTING: Individual conversational interviews were conducted with eight intensive care nurses working in a tertiary level, university-affiliated hospital in Canada. FINDINGS: The essence of the experience of nurses caring for patients with delirium in intensive care was revealed to be finding a way to help them come through it. Six main themes emerged: It's Exhausting; Making a Picture of the Patient's Mental Status; Keeping Patients Safe: It's aReally Big Job; Everyone Is Unique; Riding It Out With Families and Taking Every Experience With You. CONCLUSION: The findings contribute to an understanding of how intensive care nurses help patients and their families through this complex and distressing experience.",0
238,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate ICU health care providers' perception towards communication and associated problems with mechanically ventilated (MV) patients. The primary aim was to quantify the extent of the problem and to determine its effect on patient care and job satisfaction. METHODS: A multicenter survey study was conducted among nurses, residents and intensivists of 15 ICUs in the Netherlands using an online questionnaire. RESULTS: Out of 1740 caregivers, 457 responses were received. Communication difficulties were experienced in half of the interactions with MV patients. Over 75% of participants indicated that patient care was negatively affected. Job satisfaction was negatively affected in 43% of the participants, primarily with feelings of unfulfillment (76%) and frustration (72%). Patient factors considered relevant to communication difficulties were delirium, disease severity and anxiety, among others. To facilitate communication, the use of basic gestures remained the most preferred method. CONCLUSIONS: In half of the interactions with MV patients, health care professionals experience significant communication difficulties. The respondents indicated that these difficulties frequently lead to negative effects on patient care and job satisfaction. These results emphasize the need for improvements such as the development of communication protocols, skills training and continued research into new communication methods.",0
239,"OBJECTIVE: Despite high rates and increased risk of mortality, delirium remains underdiagnosed and a minimal focus of formal medical education. This is the first study to examine the educational impact of a psychiatric liaison on beliefs and knowledge about delirium among both nurses and residents. METHOD: One psychiatrist spent 9 months rounding weekly in the medical intensive care unit, interacting with critical care nurses and internal medicine residents. Preintervention and postintervention surveys were distributed in July 2009 and June 2010, respectively, to staff (critical care nurses: n = 23 and n = 25, respectively; internal medicine residents: n = 31 and n = 23, respectively) and a comparison group (psychiatry residents: n = 29 and n = 23, respectively). Participants responded to 12 statements regarding delirium on a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the presurveys and postsurveys for any item when examining all respondents together, as well as psychiatry and internal medicine residents as individual groups. Critical care nurses showed a significant change between surveys for the statements, ""Patients with new-onset anxiety or depression in the intensive care unit most commonly have delirium"" (17.4% agree presurvey vs 56.0% agree postsurvey, χ(2) = 7.62, P = .006) and ""Delirium is diagnosed less often than it actually occurs"" (100% agree presurvey vs 80% agree postsurvey, χ(2) = 5.13, P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: Though introduction of a psychiatric liaison was very well received by clinical staff, we did not meaningfully affect the attitudes and beliefs of trainees and nurses regarding delirium. Robust and lasting changes in attitudes regarding delirium may require more intensive efforts involving longer intervention periods, greater rounding frequency, or additional didactic teaching.",0
240,"BACKGROUND: Mechanically ventilated patients are at risk of developing delirium, which increases mortality and prolongs their stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). AIM: To investigate the assessment of delirium by ICU nurses and their experiences of using the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) in mechanically ventilated patients during daily sedation stops. METHODS: The study employed an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design. The data (n = 30) were collected by two nurses who assessed the same patient (n = 15) using the tool. Data from the nurses' assessments were analysed by means of frequency analysis, while the interviews were analysed phenomenographically using Dahlgren and Fallberg's seven categories. FINDINGS: Four pairs of nurses made similar assessments, three pairs had differing assessments and in eight pairs, one of the nurses did not fill in the form properly. The interviews revealed variations in ICU nurses' preparation for, views on and use of the CAM-ICU. CONCLUSION: Assessment and use of the CAM-ICU revealed variations, indicating the necessity of identifying barriers within the ICU team. ICU nurses need training in the use of the CAM-ICU and support in their decision-making. The individual nurse must take responsibility for updating their knowledge and for following guidelines.",0
241,"BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis for Arabic speaking critically ill patients suffering from delirium is limited by the need for a valid/reliable translation of a standardized delirium instrument such as the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity and reliability of the Arabic version of the CAM-ICU. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study design was used to conduct the current study. SETTINGS: Data collection took place in Geriatric, Emergency and Surgical intensive care units. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-eight adult patients met the inclusion criteria and participated in the study. Among the participants 22(38%) patients were on mechanical ventilation. METHODS: After translating the CAM-ICU into Arabic language, the Arabic CAM-ICU was administered by two well-trained critical care nurses and compared with reference standard assessments by delirium experts using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM -IV-TR), along with assessment of severity of illness using Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). Concurrent validity was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) for the two Arabic CAM-ICU raters, where calculations were based on considering the DSM-IV-TR criterion as the reference standard. The convergent validity of the Arabic CAM-ICU was explored by comparing the Arabic CAM-ICU ratings and the total score of SOFA (severity of illness) and MMSE (cognitive impairment). RESULTS: A total of 58 ICU patients were included, of whom 27 (47%) were diagnosed with delirium during their ICU stay via DSM-IV criteria. Interrater reliability for the Arabic CAM-ICU, overall and for mechanically ventilated patients assessed using Cohen's kappa (κ) were 0.82 and 1, respectively, p < 0.001. The sensitivities (95% CI) for the two critical care nurses when using the Arabic CAM-ICU compared with the reference standard were 81% (60%-93%) and 85% (65%-95%), respectively, whereas specificity (95% CI) was 81%(62%-92%) for both nurses. High sensitivity and specificity measures were also observed across subgroups; 100% for mechanically ventilated patients, 88% (60%-98%) and 79% (49%-94%) for those aged 65 years or older and 82% (56%-95%) and 75% (43%-93%) for those with SOFA scores at or above the median value. CONCLUSIONS: The Arabic CAM-ICU appeared to be valid and reliable tool for diagnosing delirium. Future investigations may lead to a better understanding of the prevalence, predictors, and consequences of delirium among critically ill Arabic speaking patients.",0
242,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is an independent predictor of mortality and morbidity in the intensive care unit and is associated with a prolonged hospital and intensive care unit stay. National guidelines suggest that intensive care unit delirium is screened for daily using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit validated screening tool. Research suggests that there is a lack of knowledge on intensive care unit delirium, its screening tools and that it is inadequately screened for. AIMS: The aim of the study is to assess nursing and medical staff knowledge, understanding and management of intensive care unit delirium and assess the perceived barriers associated with intensive care unit delirium screening using a validated screening tool. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SETTING: A survey design was used and a questionnaire designed to collect the data. The sample consisted of 149 nursing and medical staff working in three district intensive care units within the United Kingdom. RESULTS: The data yielded reveals that 44% (n = 33) of the respondents were not educated on ICU delirium. Furthermore the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit was only being used in one out of the three sites surveyed and this was found to be at best sporadic, this fails to adhere to current delirium guidelines (NICE, 2010). Those using a non structured way of detecting delirium observed for hallucinations and agitation. Common associated barriers quoted in the literature such as time restraints did not appear to be an issue in this study. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that despite national guidelines screening with a validated delirium screening tool is not being performed in two of the intensive care unit surveyed and one site employs the confusion assessment method for the intensive care however screening is sporadic. This study contributes to the evidence base suggesting that intensive care unit delirium is under recognised and screened for despite current guidelines.",0
243,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the incidence of delirium has grown to epidemic proportions in the intensive care setting with up to 80% of mechanically ventilated patients being affected. This can lead to adverse patient outcomes such as increased lengths of hospital stay, increased mortality rates, and increased long-term cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this project is to determine whether a quality improvement project can increase adherence to an existing pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD) protocol for enhanced patient outcomes. METHODS: Chart audits were conducted to determine baseline compliance, use of the PAD protocol was measured, and the type of medications administered to each mechanically ventilated patient was assessed. Using the Knowledge-to-Action framework, a multidisciplinary, multidimensional educational module was then developed and implemented that included an online tutorial, point-of-care reminders, written materials, and verbal coaching. A 3-month postimplementation chart audit was conducted to determine whether increased protocol competence was achieved. RESULTS: Protocol use unexpectedly decreased from 74% to 41% (P < .01);however, compliance with medication recommendations did increase despite the decrease in use. Intravenous opioid use increased from 12% to 40% (P ≤ .001), whereas sedative propofol infusions decreased from 82% to 35% (P ≤ .001). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a multidimensional, multidisciplinary project was successful in increasing compliance to the clinical practice guidelines for the management of PAD in adult intensive care unit patients, despite a decrease in protocol use. This unanticipated decrease in protocol use indicates the need for additional research in this area. Future recommendations also include a review of the existing PAD protocol to determine whether revisions could be made to better suit the needs of the staff while also improving patient outcomes in the arena of delirium experienced during critical care stays.",0
244,"It has been estimated that between 12.5% and 38% of conscious patients admitted to critical care settings experience Intensive Care Unit psychosis, a condition which seems to resolve upon transfer to the ward. This phenomenon was traditionally recognized when the patient outwardly exhibited abnormal behaviours and signs in the form of confusion, delirium, anxiety, depression, delusions and audiovisual hallucinations, yet it has been argued that due to the illness of the patient and their suppressed ability to communicate, such overt displays of unusual behaviour are the tip of the iceberg. In recognizing this phenomenon, it is felt that a relationship exists between Intensive Care Unit Psychosis, the therapeutic nurse-patient relationship, and the environment in which nurses' interactions with their clients occur. This paper will explore the interaction between these three elements while considering the implications for contemporary nursing practice.",0
245,"Pain management for critically ill patients provides physicians with the challenge of maximizing patient comfort while avoiding the risks that arise with oversedation. Preventing oversedation has become increasingly important as we better understand the negative impact it has on patients' experiences and outcomes. Current research suggests that oversedation can result in complications such as thromboembolism, pulmonary compromise, immunosuppression and delirium. Fortunately, the analgesic options available for physicians to limit these complications are growing as more treatment modalities are being researched and implemented in the intensive care unit. Our goal is to outline some of the effective and widely utilized tools available to physicians to appropriately and safely manage pain while avoiding oversedation in the critically ill population.",0
246,"OBJECTIVE: To narrate the nurses' training experience in the implementation of a systematic delirium screening tool using the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit. METHOD: Experience report covering the steps of situation diagnosis, planning, staff training and evaluation of the tool's implementation between January and March 2013 with nurses in the ICU of a tertiary hospital in São Paulo. RESULTS: The implementation of the assessment, using the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit, obtained significant nurse adhesion and became a service indicator. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: The experience has shown that this assessment allows the results of the work process to be analyzed and the consequent transformation of daily initiatives.",0
247,"OBJECTIVE: To describe methodology used to diagnose delirium in research studies evaluating delirium detection tools. METHODS: The authors used a survey to address reference rater methodology for delirium diagnosis, including rater characteristics, sources of patient information, and diagnostic process, completed via web or telephone interview according to respondent preference. Participants were authors of 39 studies included in three recent systematic reviews of delirium detection instruments in hospitalized patients. RESULTS: Authors from 85% (N = 33) of the 39 eligible studies responded to the survey. The median number of raters per study was 2.5 (interquartile range: 2-3); 79% were physicians. The raters' median duration of clinical experience with delirium diagnosis was 7 years (interquartile range: 4-10), with 5% having no prior clinical experience. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated in 70% of studies. Cognitive tests and delirium detection tools were used in the delirium reference rating process in 61% (N = 21) and 45% (N = 15) of studies, respectively, with 33% (N = 11) using both and 27% (N = 9) using neither. When patients were too drowsy or declined to participate in delirium evaluation, 70% of studies (N = 23) used all available information for delirium diagnosis, whereas 15% excluded such patients. CONCLUSION: Significant variability exists in reference standard methods for delirium diagnosis in published research. Increasing standardization by documenting inter-rater reliability, using standardized cognitive and delirium detection tools, incorporating diagnostic expert consensus panels, and using all available information in patients declining or unable to participate with formal testing may help advance delirium research by increasing consistency of case detection and improving generalizability of research results.",0
248,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with the ABCDEF bundle (Assess, prevent, and manage pain, Both, spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, Choice of sedation/analgesia, Delirium assess, prevent and manage, Early mobility/exercise and Family engagement/empowerment) adherence, in critically ill patients during the first 96 hours of mechanical ventilation. DESIGN: Observational study using electronic health record data. SETTING: 15 intensive care units located in seven community hospitals in a western United States health system. PATIENTS: 977 adult patients who were on mechanical ventilation for greater than 24 hours and admitted to an intensive care unit over six months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis was used to examine factors contributing to bundle adherence while adjusting for severity of illness, days on mechanical ventilation, hospital site and time elapsed. ABCDEF bundle adherence was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation for less than 48 hours (p = 0.01), who received continuous sedation for less than 24 hours (p < 0.001), admitted from skilled nursing facilities (p < 0.05), and over the course of the six-month study period (p < 0.01). Bundle adherence was significantly lower for Hispanic patients (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified potentially modifiable factors that could improve the team's performance of the ABCDEF bundle in patients requiring mechanical ventilation.",0
249,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The Institute of Medicine Committee on the Future of Emergency Care in the United States Health System (2003) identified a need to enhance the research base for emergency care. As a result, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Task Force on Research in Emergency Medicine was formed to enhance NIH support for emergency care research. Members of the NIH Task Force and academic leaders in emergency care participated in 3 Roundtable discussions to prioritize current opportunities for enhancing and conducting emergency care research. We identify key research questions essential to advancing the science of emergency care and discuss the barriers and strategies to advance research by exploring the collaboration between NIH and the emergency care community. METHODS: Experts from emergency medicine, neurology, psychiatry, and public health assembled to review critical areas in need of investigation, current gaps in knowledge, barriers, and opportunities. Neurologic emergencies included cerebral resuscitation, pain, stroke, syncope, traumatic brain injury, and pregnancy. Mental health topics included suicide, agitation and delirium, substances, posttraumatic stress, violence, and bereavement. RESULTS: Presentations and group discussion firmly established the need for translational research to bring basic science concepts into the clinical arena. A coordinated continuum of the health care system that ensures rapid identification and stabilization and extends through discharge is necessary to maximize overall patient outcomes. There is a paucity of well-designed, focused research on diagnostic testing, clinical decisionmaking, and treatments in the emergency setting. Barriers include the limited number of experienced researchers in emergency medicine, limited dedicated research funding, and difficulties of conducting research in chaotic emergency environments stressed by crowding and limited resources. Several themes emerged during the course of the roundtable discussion, including the need for development of (1) a research infrastructure for the rapid identification, consent, and tracking of research subjects that incorporates innovative informatics technologies, essential for future research; (2) diagnostic strategies and tools necessary to understand key populations and the process of medical decisionmaking, including the investigation of the pathobiology of symptoms and symptom-oriented therapies; (3) collaborative research networks to provide unique opportunities to form partnerships, leverage patient cohorts and clinical and financial resources, and share data; (4) formal research training programs integral for creating new knowledge and advancing the science and practice of emergency medicine; and (5) recognition that emergency care is part of an integrated system from emergency medical services dispatch to discharge. The NIH Roundtable ""Opportunities to Advance Research on Neurological and Psychiatric Emergencies"" created a framework to guide future emergency medicine-based research initiatives. CONCLUSION: Emergency departments provide the portal of access to the health care system for most patients with acute neurologic and psychiatric illness. Emergency physicians and colleagues are primed to investigate neurologic and psychiatric emergencies that will directly improve the delivery of care and patient outcomes.",0
250,"PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to characterize the practices of Brazilian ICU physicians toward sedation and delirium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a convenience sample of critical care physicians between April and June 2008. RESULTS: One thousand fifteen critical care physicians responded. Sedation scoring systems were used by 893 (88.3%) of the respondents. The Ramsay and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale were used by 81.9% and 6.8% of the respondents, respectively. Most respondents did not discuss sedation targets (62.8%) or practice daily sedative interruption (68.3%) in most patients. More than half of the respondents (52.7%) used a sedation protocol, and the most used sedatives were midazolam (97.8%), fentanyl (91.5%), and propofol (55%). A significant rate of the respondents (42.7%) estimated that more than 25% of patients under mechanical ventilation have delirium, but 53.5% occasionally assessed patients for delirium. Thirteen percent used specific delirium scales, with the Confusion Assessment Method for intensive care unit (ICU) being the most applied. Delirium was often treated with haloperidol (88.1%); however, atypical antipsychotics (36.3%) and benzodiazepines (42.3%) were also used. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the recent advances in knowledge of sedation and delirium, most of them are still not translated into clinical practice. Significant variation in practice is observed among ICU physicians and represents a potential target for future research and educational interventions.",0
251,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To create a framework for future research through application and critique of the Life Course Health Development Model to the phenomenon of paediatric delirium. BACKGROUND: Delirium in the paediatric intensive care unit is associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay and mortality. Nurses are uniquely positioned at the bedside to identify, prevent and treat delirium. An understanding of the potential long-term consequences of paediatric delirium is necessary to provide impetus for nursing research and practice change. The Life Course Health Development Model is a valuable tool when considering the multiple mechanisms and processes through which the experience of delirium could affect a child's life trajectory. DESIGN: Critical review of the literature through application and critique of the Life Course Health Development Model in the context of paediatric delirium. Gaps in the current understanding of paediatric delirium, as well as future directions for research and practice, are discussed. METHODS: The seven core principles of the model are considered in the context of paediatric delirium. Each of the principles has the potential to further understanding of paediatric delirium and identify areas for future inquiry. This discussion leads to a critique of the ability of the model to lead future research and practice change. CONCLUSIONS: The Life Course Health Development Model depicts a process in which the acute and severe stress of critical illness leads to maladaptive neurologic changes that contribute to the development of delirium and impair a child's life trajectory. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: By emphasising the potential lifelong consequences for critically ill children who experience delirium, this application of the Life Course Health Development Model will stimulate discussion, research and practice change among paediatric clinicians and researchers.",0
252,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore how change-of-shift handoffs relate to nurses' clinical judgments regarding patient risk of deterioration. BACKGROUND: The transfer of responsibility for patients' care comes with an exchange of information about their condition during change-of-shift handoff. However, it is unclear how this exchange affects nurses' clinical judgments regarding patient risk of deterioration. DESIGN: A sequential explanatory mixed-methods study reported according to the STROBE and COREQ guidelines. METHODS: Over four months, 62 nurses from one surgical and two medical units at a single Canadian hospital recorded their handoffs at change of shift. After each handoff, the two nurses involved each rated the patient's risk of experiencing cardiac arrest or being transferred to an intensive care unit in the next 24 hr separately. The information shared in handoffs was subjected to content analysis; code frequencies were contrasted per nurses' ratings of patient risk to identify characteristics of information that facilitated or hindered nurses' agreement. RESULTS: Out of 444 recorded handoffs, there were 125 in which at least one nurse judged that a patient was at risk of deterioration; nurses agreed in 32 cases (25.6%) and disagreed in 93 (74.4%). These handoffs generally included information on abnormal vital signs, breathing problems, chest pain, alteration of mental status or neurological symptoms. However, the quantity and seriousness of clinical cues, recent transfers from intensive care units, pain without a clear cause, signs of delirium and nurses' knowledge of patient were found to affect nurses' agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses exchanged more information regarding known indicators of deterioration in handoffs when they judged that patients were at risk. Disagreements most often involved incoming nurses rating patient risk as higher. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study suggests a need to sensitise nurses to the impact of certain cues at report on their colleagues' subsequent clinical judgments. Low levels of agreement between nurses underscore the importance of exchanging impressions regarding the likely evolution of a patient's situation to promote continuity of care.",0
253,"BACKGROUND: The impact of using a validated delirium screening tool and different levels of education on surgical-trauma intensive care unit (STICU) nurses' knowledge about delirium is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To measure the impact of using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC), with or without a multi-faceted education program, on STICU nurses' knowledge and perceptions of delirium and their ability to evaluate it correctly. METHODS: The knowledge and perceptions of subject nurses about delirium, and agreement between the independent assessments of delirium by the subject nurse and by a validated judge (who always used the ICDSC), were compared across 3 phases. Phase 1: No delirium screening tool and no education. Phase 2: ICDSC and minimal education (ie, ICDSC validation study only). Phase 3: ICDSC and multifaceted education (ie, pharmacist-led didactic lecture, Web-based module, and nurse-led bedside training). RESULTS: Nurses' knowledge (mean [SD] score out of 10 points) was similar (P = .08) in phase 1 (6.1 [1.4]) and phase 2 (6.5 [1.4]) but was greater (P = .001) in phase 3 (8.2 [1.4]). Agreement between nurses and the validated judge in the assessment of delirium increased from phase 1 (κ = 0.40) to phase 2 (κ = 0.62) to phase 3 (κ = 0.74). Nurses perceived use of the ICDSC as improving their ability to recognize delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a multifaceted education program improves both nurses' knowledge about delirium and their perceptions about its recognition. Implementation of the ICDSC improves the ability of STICU nurses to evaluate delirium correctly.",0
254,"OBJECTIVE: To compare and contrast the process used to implement an early mobility program in ICUs at three different medical centers and to assess their impact on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. DESIGN: Three ICU early mobilization quality improvement projects are summarized utilizing the Institute for Healthcare Improvement framework of Plan-Do-Study-Act. INTERVENTION: Each of the three ICU early mobilization programs required an interprofessional team-based approach to plan, educate, and implement the ICU early mobility program. Champions from each profession-nursing, physical therapy, physician, and respiratory care-were identified to facilitate changes in ICU culture and clinical practice and to identify and address barriers to early mobility program implementation at each institution. SETTING: The medical ICU at Wake Forest University, the medical ICU at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and the mixed medical-surgical ICU at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center. RESULTS: Establishing an ICU early mobilization quality improvement program resulted in a reduced ICU and hospital length of stay at all three institutions and decreased rates of delirium and the need for sedation for the patients enrolled in the Johns Hopkins ICU early mobility program. CONCLUSION: Instituting a planned, structured ICU early mobility quality improvement project can result in improved outcomes and reduced costs for ICU patients across healthcare systems.",0
255,"Admission to critical care can have far-reaching psychological effects because of the distinct environment. Critical care services are being re-shaped to address long-term sequelae, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. The long-term consequences of critical illness not only cost the individual, but also have implications for society, such as diminished areas of health-related quality-of-life in sleep, reduced ability to return to work and enjoy recreational activities (Audit Commission, 1999; Hayes et al, 2000). The debate around the phenomenon of intensive care unit (ICU) syndrome is discussed with reference to current thinking. After critical care, patients may experience amnesia, continued hallucinations or flashbacks, anxiety, depression, and dreams and nightmares. Nursing care for patients while in the critical care environment can have a positive effect on psychological well-being. Facilitating communication, explaining care and rationalizing interventions, ensuring patients are oriented as to time and place, reassuring patients about transfer, providing patients,where possible, with information about critical care before admission and considering anxiolytic use, are all practices that have a beneficial effect on patient care. Follow-up services can help patients come to terms with their experiences of critical illness and provide the opportunity for them to access further intervention if desired. Working towards providing optimal psychological care will have a positive effect on patients' psychological recovery and may also help physical recuperation after critical care.",0
256,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacists are key members of the intensive care unit (ICU) team; however, few data exist regarding their clinical role, perceptions, and current practices in recognizing and managing delirium. OBJECTIVE: To describe current practices and perceptions of ICU pharmacists regarding delirium recognition and treatment relative to current recommendations. METHODS: A self-administered survey was distributed to 457 pharmacists in 8 states who are members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine or the American College of Clinical Pharmacy and who spend 25% or more of their time providing clinical ICU pharmacy services. RESULTS: A total of 250 (55%) pharmacists responded. A delirium screening tool was routinely used by few (7%) pharmacists. Lack of time (34%) and the belief that screening is a nursing role (24%) were key barriers to pharmacist screenings. Most (85%) said that delirium should be pharmacologically managed; 68% responded that 2 or more medications should be used. The treatments of first choice included haloperidol (76%), an atypical antipsychotic (14%), or a benzodiazepine (10%). Frequently used treatments were haloperidol (87%), quetiapine (59%), and lorazepam (47%). Haloperidol was perceived by many (42%) to have 1 or more randomized trials supporting its use for delirium and Food and Drug Administration approval for this indication (34%). Haloperidol was most often administered on a scheduled basis (62%), intravenously (92%), and at a daily dose of 5-10 mg (58%). While the QTc interval was frequently measured at least once per shift using an electrocardiogram strip (64%), it was not routinely measured in 20% of ICUs, and 60% continued haloperidol when the QTc exceeded 500 msec. CONCLUSIONS: Current practices and perceptions surrounding recognition and treatment of delirium in patients in the ICU by the critical care pharmacists surveyed are heterogeneous. Antipsychotics are frequently recommended by pharmacists for delirium treatment, despite a lack of rigorous evidence to support their use. While pharmacists are ideally suited to lead delirium recognition efforts and provide treatment recommendations in this area, these roles need further elucidation. The optimal pedagogical strategy to support these efforts remains unclear, and the potential impact of pharmacists' efforts on patients' outcomes is unknown.",0
257,"OBJECTIVE: To adapt the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) for the diagnosis of delirium to the language and culture of Spain and to validate the adapted version. DESIGN: Population validation. SETTING: Intensive care units in a 600-bed university hospital. PATIENTS: We studied 29 critical patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Mean age was 70 years (range 58-77 years), mean APACHE II score 16 (range 13-21), and mean SOFA score 7 (range 4-8). INTERVENTION: Two independent operators applied the Spanish version of the CAM-ICU and a psychiatrist applied the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition-Revised (DSM IV TR). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES: Concordance (kappa index), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), and validity (sensitivity and specificity) of the Spanish version of the CAM-ICU were compared to the DSM IV TR, which is considered the current gold standard. RESULTS: The translation and cultural adaptation was carried out in accordance with current international guidelines. A total of 65 assessments were performed in 29 patients. The interobserver concordance was high: kappa statistic 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.96). The internal consistence was adequate: Cronbach's alpha=0.84 (unilateral 95% CI: 0.77). For observer A (a physician), the sensitivity of the Spanish version of the CAM-ICU was 80% and the specificity was 96%. For observer B, (a nurse) the sensitivity was 83% and the specificity was 96%. CONCLUSIONS: The Spanish version of the CAM-ICU is a valid, reliable, and reproducible instrument that can be satisfactorily applied to diagnose delirium in Spanish-speaking ICU patients.",0
258,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a frequently encountered condition in critically ill patients that has significant clinical impacts. Associated costs for patients impacted by delirium are higher, including a 39% higher intensive care unit (ICU) cost and 31% higher hospital costs, yet delirium goes unnoticed in up to 72% of cases. If ICU nurses are not aware of risk factors and presentation of delirium, the condition may go unrecognized, allowing for development of negative sequelae. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research study was to examine delirium knowledge levels of ICU nurses at a single level I trauma hospital both before and after a tailored educational intervention. METHODS: A preintervention/postintervention research study design in conjunction with a tailored educational intervention was utilized. Preintervention/postintervention delirium knowledge testing was completed through the use of the Nurses' Knowledge of Delirium Questionnaire. RESULTS: The results indicated a significant difference in preintervention scores (mean, 74.65 [SD, 8.68]) and postintervention scores (mean, 84.95 [SD, 5.73]); t23 = -5.256, P = .000. These results suggest that an educational intervention does have an impact on ICU nurses' knowledge level of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: If ICU nurses are not aware of the fluctuating nature of delirium and its varied clinical presentations, they cannot be expected to consistently identify its development when providing care. Through educational activities, it is possible to increase team member knowledge levels, potentially resulting in increased identification of delirium and a reduction in negative sequelae.",0
259,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine current delirium practices in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting and evaluate awareness and adoption of the 2013 Pain, Agitation, and Delirium (PAD) guidelines with emphasis on delirium management. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A large-scale, multidisciplinary, online survey was administered to physician, pharmacist, nurse, and mid-level practitioner members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) between September 2014 and October 2014. A total of 635 respondents completed the survey. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Nonpharmacologic interventions such as early mobilization were used in most ICUs (83%) for prevention of delirium. A majority of respondents (97%) reported using pharmacologic agents to treat hyperactive delirium. Ninety percent of the respondents answered that they were aware of the 2013 PAD guidelines, and 75% of respondents felt that their delirium practices have been changed as a result of the new guidelines. In addition, logistic regression analysis of this study showed that respondents who use delirium screening tools were twice more likely to be fully aware of key components of the updated guidelines (odds ratio [OR] = 2.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20-3.60). CONCLUSIONS: Most critical care practitioners are fully aware and knowledgeable of key recommendations in the new guidelines and have changed their delirium practices accordingly.",0
260,"The end of life is a period of intensive care. It is imperative that physicians have training and skills in the care of dying patients. Understanding the process of dying and recognizing physical changes aids in prognostication. Skills in facilitating family coping, treating pain, respiratory distress and delirium are critical.",0
261,"The understanding of delirium is as a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that is characterized by disturbances in consciousness, orientation, memory, thought, perception, and behavior resulting from or more structural and/or physiological abnormalities directly or indirectly affecting the brain. It is quite prevalent in medical and surgical settings and is associated with high rates of death and healthcare costs.[1] Delirium is defined as a unitary syndrome, whereby a range of different etiological causes produces a relatively consistent pattern of acute generalized cognitive disturbances. Delirium was introduced as an umbrella term encompassing all such disturbances and thus subsumed a range of synonyms that had previously been in use (acute confusion, ICU psychosis, acute brain failure, septic encephalopathy, etc.). However, despite these commonalities, the symptom profile, course, and outcome of delirium are highly heterogeneous. Consequently, interest has focused on identifying clinically meaningful subtypes. Disturbances of motor behavior are an important and highly visible feature of delirium that physicians have recognized since ancient times with the terms ‘phrenitis,’ and ‘lethargus’ used to denote agitated/hyperactive vs. somnolent/hypoactive presentations respectively. To date, there have been many studies of motor-defined clinical subtypes of delirium, which suggests that they differ significantly regarding frequency and severity of non-motoric symptoms, etiology, pathophysiology, detection rates, and treatment experience.[2] Delirium characteristically demonstrates a cluster of symptoms of which the ’core’ symptoms, which more frequently present include fluctuating levels of consciousness, inattention and disorientation, sleep-wake cycle disturbances, memory impairment, and motor activity changes. Other features that are more variable in their presentation are perceptual disturbances, thought process abnormalities, and affective disturbances.[3] The term “excited delirium” first appeared in 1985.[4] The term gained popularity in academic literature in the late 1980s as cocaine, and other sympathomimetic drugs gained popularity in the United States, and a movement toward the de-institutionalization of the chronically mentally ill occurred.[5] Excited delirium syndrome is a disease state characterized by a constellation of delirium, agitation, and hyperadrenergic autonomic dysfunction. The cause of excited delirium is multifactorial and secondary to a complex interaction of co-morbid, and acute-on-chronic medical conditions, including psychiatric, neurologic, toxicologic, thermal, and metabolic derangement. In 1849, Dr. Luther Bell, the primary psychiatrist at McLane Asylum for the Insane, introduced the disease into medical literature under the name ""Bell mania."" It correlates with elevated morbidity and mortality that is at least in part independent of underlying medical morbidity and premorbid cognitive status.[6]",0
262,"AIM: The aim of this study was to establish intensive care unit nurses' knowledge of delirium within an acute tertiary hospital within South East Asia. BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common, life threatening and often preventable cause of morbidity and mortality among older patients. Undetected and untreated delirium is a catalyst to increased mortality, morbidity, functional decline and results in increased requirement for nursing care, healthcare expense and hospital length of stay. However, despite effective assessment tools to identify delirium in the acute setting, there still remains an inability of ICU nurses' to accurately identify delirium in the critically ill patient especially that of hypoactive delirium. METHOD: A purposive sample of 53 staff nurses from a 13-bedded medical intensive care unit within an acute tertiary teaching hospital in South East Asia were asked to participate. A 40 item 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was employed to determine the participants' knowledge of the signs and symptoms; the risk factors and negative outcomes of delirium. RESULTS: The overall positively answered mean score was 27 (67.3%) out of a possible 40 questions. Mean scores for knowledge of signs and symptoms, risk factors and negative outcomes were 9.52 (63.5%, n=15), 11.43 (63.5%, n=17) and 6.0 (75%, n=8), respectively. CONCLUSION: Whilst the results of this study are similar to others taken from a western perspective, it appeared that the ICU nurses in this study demonstrated limited knowledge of the signs and symptoms, risk factors and negative outcomes of delirium in the critically patient. The implications for practice of this are important given the outcomes of untreated delirium.",0
263,"The plight of older adults during catastrophic events is a societal concern. Older persons have an increased prevalence of cognitive disorders, chronic illnesses, and mobility problems that limit their ability to cope. These disorders may result in a lack of mental capacity and the ability to discern when they should evacuate or resolve problems encountered during a catastrophe. Some older persons may have limited transportation options, and many of the elderly survivors are at increased risk for abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Recommendations for future catastrophic events include the development of a federal tracking system for elders and other vulnerable adults, the designation of separate shelter areas for elders and other vulnerable adults, and involvement of gerontological professionals in all aspects of emergency preparedness and care delivery, including training of frontline workers. Preparation through preevent planning that includes region-specific social services, medical and public health resources, volunteers, and facilities for elders and vulnerable adults is critical. Elders need to be protected from abuse and fraud during catastrophic events. A public health triage system for elders and other vulnerable populations in pre- and postdisaster situations is useful, and disaster preparedness is paramount. Communities and members of safety and rescue teams must address ethical issues before an event. When older adults are involved, consideration needs to be given to triage decision making, transporting those who are immobile, the care of older adults who receive palliative care, and the equitable distribution of resources. Nurses are perfectly equipped with the skills, knowledge, and training needed to plan and implement disaster preparedness programs. In keeping with the tradition of Florence Nightingale, nurses can assume several crucial roles in disaster preparedness for older adults. Nurses possess the ability to participate and lead community policy development, serve on rescue teams, perform patient assessments, and deliver care. Nurses are crucial to well-planned and executed programs for catastrophic events that affect older adults. Also, all health care providers involved must be aware of the physical and psychological ramifications of disaster relief. The health and resilience of disaster-relief teams depend on paying attention to signs and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and seeking appropriate treatment should it occur.",0
264,"Palliative care (PC) is a vital part of the responses needed to address the outcomes of cancer and other non-communicable diseases such as chronic pain, terminal illnesses, and end-of-life situations. Until today, there is a significant lack of access to PC in most developing countries, where the majority of the global population lives. Deficiencies in nurses' knowledge and attitudes exacerbate the lack of access to PC and end-of-life care (EOLC) in these countries. This study was conducted in Oman to assess undergraduate nursing students' (NS) PC knowledge and attitudes towards EOLC. A cross-sectional design was used to collect data from 276 NS in all undergraduate programs in Oman. The PC knowledge and attitude towards EOLC were measured using the PEACE-Q and FATCOD-B. The NS had a borderline level of PC knowledge but favorable attitudes towards EOLC. The NS were least knowledgeable about the philosophy of PC, delirium, side effects of opioids, cancer pain, and dyspnea. There were differences in PC knowledge and attitudes across programs. The findings highlight potential deficiencies and opportunities that can be utilized to augment future nursing human resources for PC and EOLC in Oman. We recommend a national interdisciplinary PC education and training consortium (NIPCET-C) to dialogue, develop, promote, monitor, and evaluate PC and EOLC education in Oman.",0
265,"AIM: To share an experience of introducing Delirium scoring into a Cardiothoracic Critical Care Unit and the lessons learnt. BACKGROUND: Delirium has serious consequences leading to increased length of stay in hospital, the possible development of dementia with the associated need for long-term care and even death. It is therefore vital that the Critical Care nurses are able to prevent, recognize and manage delirium. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: 108 patients who were admitted over a 6 week period were audited and their delirium score, documentation and treatment plans were reviewed. RESULTS: 21% of patients experienced delirium during their stay on Cardiothoracic Critical Care and hypoactive delirium was the most prevalent subtype. Of the three patients who stayed more than 20 days on critical care all suffered with delirium at some point during their stay. Documentation of delirium by both Nursing and Medical staff occurred in less than 50% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of delirium scoring and audit of its practice has highlighted the incidence of delirium in critically ill patients and has resulted in; Improved quality of care by development of a delirium care bundle Improved recognition of delirium Instigation of practices to prevent and treat delirium.",0
266,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety is an unpleasant emotion that most intensive care patients experience. This emotion is an important issue in intensive care settings because of its prevalence, adverse effects and severity. Little is known about the factors associated with state and trait anxiety during critical illness. OBJECTIVES: To describe the patterns of state anxiety reported by intensive care patients, and identify factors associated with state and trait anxiety. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTINGS: One mixed intensive care unit in Brisbane, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (n=141, ≥18 years) admitted to the intensive care unit for ≥24h; able to communicate verbally or non-verbally; understand English; and, open their eyes spontaneously or in response to voice. METHODS: Outcomes were state anxiety as measured by the Faces Anxiety Scale and trait anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Pre-intensive care factors tested for possible associations with both state and trait anxiety were: age, gender, marital status, employment status, level of education, smoking status, personality trait of optimism and evidence of mental health care/treatment. Intra-intensive care factors tested were: reason for admission to the intensive care unit, delirium, pain, airway status, hours of mechanical ventilation, severity of illness, days of stay in intensive care, exposure to corticosteroids, opioids, benzodiazepines, anxiolytics, antidepressants, beta-blockers, anaesthetic agents and analgesics; length of sedation and analgesia and total doses of sedatives and analgesics. RESULTS: Of 141 participants, 98 (70%) were male with an average age of 54 (standard deviation: ±15) years and stayed in intensive care for about 4 (Interquartile Range: 3-7) days. The majority (n=115; 82%) of participants experienced state anxiety at least once during their stay in intensive care, with 57% reporting moderate to severe levels. Factors related to state anxiety in intensive care were pain and trait anxiety. Factors associated with trait anxiety were trait optimism, state anxiety, evidence of mental health care/treatment and age. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a better understanding of contributing factors for anxiety in the critically ill. Trait anxiety and state anxiety were significantly associated with each other, namely, patients who were anxious by nature experienced higher levels of state anxiety, which persisted throughout their stay in the intensive care unit. Recognising the importance of state and trait anxiety assessments using validated tools and determining ways to manage anxiety in the critically ill are critical aspects of the intensive care nurses role.",0
267,"BACKGROUND: As many delirium manifestations (e.g., hallucinations or fears) are linked to patients' experiences and personality traits, it is suggested that interventions should be tailored to optimize its management. The inclusion of family members, as part of an intervention, has recently emerged as a solution to developing individualised patient care, but has never been assessed in post-cardiac surgery intensive care unit where almost half of patients will present with delirium. AIMS: To assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of an nursing intervention involving family caregivers (FC) in delirium management following cardiac surgery. DESIGN: A randomized pilot study. METHODS: A total of 30 patient/FC dyads were recruited and randomized to usual care (n = 14) or intervention (n = 16). The intervention was based on the Human Caring Theory, a mentoring model, and sources informing self-efficacy. It comprised seven planned encounters spread over 3 days between an intervention nurse and the FC, each including a 30-min visit at the patient's bedside. During this bedside visit, the FC used delirium management strategies, e.g. reorient the person with delirium. The primary indicator of acceptability was to obtain consent from 75% of approached FCs. The preliminary effect of the intervention on patient outcomes was assessed on (1) delirium severity using the Delirium Index, (2) occurrence of complications, such as falls, (3) length of postoperative hospital stay and (4) psycho-functional recovery using the Sickness Impact Profile. The preliminary effect on FC outcomes was assessed on FC anxiety and self-efficacy. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, ANCOVAs and logistic regressions. RESULTS: The primary indicator of obtaining consent from FC was achieved (77%). Of the 14 dyads, thirteen (93%) dyads received all seven encounters planned in the experimental intervention. Intervention group patients presented better psycho-functional recovery scores when compared with control group patients (p = 0·01). Mean delirium severity scores showed similar trajectories on days 1, 2 and 3 in both groups. CONCLUSION: The mentoring intervention was acceptable and feasible and shows promising results in improving patients and FC outcomes. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses should involve, if willing, FC to participate in activities that optimise patient well-being FC to use recognized delirium management strategies like reorientation and reassurance.",0
268,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine predisposing and precipitating risk factors for incident delirium in medical patients during an acute hospital admission. BACKGROUND: Incident delirium is the most common complication of hospital admission for older patients. Up to 30% of hospitalised medical patients experience incident delirium. Determining risk factors for delirium is important for identifying patients who are most susceptible to incident delirium. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study with two controls per case. METHODS: An audit tool was used to review medical records of patients admitted to acute medical units for data regarding potential risk factors for delirium. Data were collected between August 2013 and March 2014 at three hospital sites of a healthcare organisation in Melbourne, Australia. Cases were 161 patients admitted to an acute medical ward and diagnosed with incident delirium between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013. Controls were 321 patients sampled from the acute medical population admitted within the same time range, stratified for admission location and who did not develop incident delirium during hospitalisation. RESULTS: Identified using logistic regression modelling, predisposing risk factors for incident delirium were dementia, cognitive impairment, functional impairment, previous delirium and fracture on admission. Precipitating risk factors for incident delirium were use of an indwelling catheter, adding more than three medications during admission and having an abnormal sodium level during admission. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple risk factors for incident delirium exist; patients with a history of delirium, dementia and cognitive impairment are at greatest risk of developing delirium during hospitalisation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses and other healthcare professionals should be aware of patients who have one or more risk factors for incident delirium. Knowledge of risk factors for delirium has the potential to increase the recognition and understanding of patients who are vulnerable to delirium. Early recognition and prevention of delirium can contribute to improved patients safety and reduction in harm.",0
269,"BACKGROUND: Patients with an open abdomen after trauma or emergency surgery may benefit from reduced sedation and chemical paralysis. We studied the effect of attending surgeon experience on sedation depth and paralytic use, as well as enteral nutrition and time between laparotomies. METHODS: We performed an institutional review board-approved survey (Sedation Level after Emergent ExLap without Primary Fascial Closure) of the senior and active Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma membership using Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Inc, Provo, UT). We obtained 393/1,655 responses (23.7%). Spearman's rho was used for ordinal data, and multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for trauma center level and presence of trainees in the relationship between surgeon experience and use of deep sedation. RESULTS: Surgeon experience was associated with deep sedation (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score ≤-3, P = .001) and chemical paralysis (P = .001). Surgeon experience was associated with less concern about delirium and more concern for evisceration as the reason for sedation depth (P = .001) and for paralysis (P = .001). Using multivariate logistic regression, surgeon experience was associated with deep sedation (odds ratio 3.6 [95% confidence interval 1.3, 10.4], P = .017 for ≥20 years; odds ratio 3.5 [95% confidence interval 1.1, 10.4], P = .025 for 15-20 years). Trauma center level was also significant (odds ratio 7.2 for Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score ≤-3 [95% confidence interval 1.7, 31.0], P = .008 for level III/IV versus level I/II). Increased surgeon experience was associated with delay of commencement of enteral feeds until return of bowel function (P = .013). Few respondents indicated willingness to extubate or mobilize open abdomen patients. Experienced surgeons were likely to wait for a defined time rather than for normalization of resuscitation markers to perform the first takeback laparotomy (P = .047) and waited longer between subsequent laparotomies (P = .004). CONCLUSION: There were significant variations in practice among respondents based on the length of time since their last residency or fellowship, including variations that deviate from current best practice for management of patients with an open abdomen.",0
270,"BACKGROUND: Post-operative delirium after cardiac surgery is an adverse event that affects patients' recovery and complicates the delivery of nursing care. Numerous risk factors for delirium are uncontrollable; however, nurses' pro re nata drug administration of sedatives may be a controllable risk factor. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relationship between nurses' pro re nata administration of midazolam hydrochloride to cardiac surgery patients and the development of post-operative delirium. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Cardiac surgery intensive care and nursing units of a tertiary care center in Vancouver, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: 122 male and female patients requiring non-emergent surgery for coronary artery disease or valvular heart disease who did not have pre-existing cognitive impairment, severe hearing or visual impairment, substance misuse, alcohol intake exceeding 7 drinks per week, or renal impairment requiring hemodialysis. METHODS: Patients were assessed for delirium, on three occasions, with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) during the first 72 h after surgery and through reviews of physicians' notes. Risk factor and midazolam dosage data were collected from medical records. RESULTS: 77.9% of the patients in this sample received midazolam hydrochloride post-operatively. The prevalence of delirium ranged from 37.7% to 44.3%. Almost all of the dosages of midazolam (85-87%) were given before the first indication of delirium; that is, most of the patients had received their entire dosage before the first signs of delirium were detected. Bivariate analysis with logistic regression models revealed that for every additional milligram of midazolam administered, the patients were 7-8% more likely to develop delirium. Multivariate logistic regression models demonstrated that the magnitude of the association between midazolam dosage and delirium was not confounded by established risk factors including age and peripheral vascular disease. CONCLUSION: Nurses play an important role in the prediction, assessment and prevention of post-operative delirium. Sedatives should be administered with caution because they increase a patient's risk of developing delirium. Nurses' decisions regarding sedation administration must be informed by empirical knowledge, accurate assessment data and clear rationale with consideration of how these actions may contribute to the development of delirium.",0
271,"To assess the current opinions of physicians and nurses regarding the prevention, diagnosis and management of delirium, survey administration was conducted to 2256 nurses and 982 physicians within the University Hospitals of Leuven (Belgium). Response rate was 26% with 819 respondents (600 nurses; 219 physicians) completing the questionnaire. 72% of the respondents considered delirium as a minor problem or no problem at all. Yet over half of respondents working on a palliative care unit (87%, n=15), traumatological ward (67%, n=18), cardio-thoracic surgery ward (58%, n=20), intensive care unit (55%, n=120) and geriatric ward (55%, n=42) reported it as a serious problem. Delirium was considered as an underdiagnosed (85%) but preventable (75%) syndrome. Yet patients at risk are rarely (34%) or never (52%) screened for delirium. In case of screening (48%), only 4% used a specific validated assessment tool. 97% of all respondents were convinced that delirium requires an active and immediate intervention of nurse and physician. 82% of the physicians preferred haldol to treat delirium, in case of alcohol withdrawal 69% chose tranxene. Physical restraints were considered important in the management of delirium by a greater proportion of nurses (49%) than physicians (28%). The severity of the problem is underestimated. While opinions regarding the treatment were quite correct, prevention and early detection of delirium deserve more attention.",0
272,"Chemical and physical restraints are frequently used in the intensive care unit (ICU) to control agitated patients and to prevent self-harm and unplanned extubations. Published work relating to the numerous issues of the care and treatment strategies for these patients remains conflicting and unclear. Literature regarding sedation and chemical restraint reveals a trend towards management with lighter sedation, use of sedation assessment tools and sedation protocols. It remains unclear which treatment is best for agitated and delirious patients, and the evidence on the effect of sedation is conflicting. A large portion of the literature on the use of physical restraint is from general hospital wards and residential homes, and not from the ICU environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide a summary of the existing literature on the use of physical and chemical restraints in the ICU setting. In Part 1 of this two-part paper, the evidence on chemical and physical restraints is explored with specific focus on definition of terms, unplanned extubation, agitation, delirium and the impact of nurse-patient ratios in the ICU on these issues. Part 2 of the paper examines the evidence related to chemical and physical restraints from the perspective of the mechanically ventilated patient.",0
273,"BACKGROUND: While specific practices for perioperative care of older adults have been recommended, little is known regarding adherence by US physician anesthesiologists to such practices. To address this gap in knowledge, the ASA Committee on Geriatric Anesthesia and the ASA Perioperative Brain Health Initiative undertook a survey of ASA members to characterize current practices related to perioperative care of older adults. METHODS: We administered a web-based questionnaire with items assessing the proportion of practice focused on delivery of care to older adults, adherence to recommended practices for older surgical patients, resource needs to improve care, and practice characteristics. RESULTS: Responses were collected between May 24, 2018, and June 29, 2018. A total of 25,587 ASA members were invited to participate, and 1737 answered at least one item (6.8%). 96.4% of respondents reported that they had cared for a patient aged 65 or older within the last year. 47.1% of respondents (95% confidence interval, 44.6%, 49.7%) reported using multimodal analgesia among patients aged 65 and older at least 90% of the time, and 25.5% (95% CI, 23.3%, 27.7%) provided preoperative information regarding postoperative cognitive changes at least 90% of the time. Over 80% of respondents reported that preoperative screening for frailty or dementia, postoperative screening for delirium, and preoperative geriatric consultation occurred in fewer than 10% of cases. Development of practice guidelines for geriatric anesthesia care and expansion of web-based resources were most frequently prioritized by respondents as initiatives to improve care in this domain. DISCUSSION: Most survey respondents reported providing anesthesia care to older adults, but adherence to recommended practices varied across the six items assessed. Reported rates of screening for common geriatric syndromes, such as frailty, delirium, and dementia, were low among survey respondents. Respondents identified multiple opportunities for ASA initiatives to support efforts to improve care for older surgical patients.",0
274,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate nurses' knowledge, attitudes and practices, and analyse the influencing factors for subsyndromal delirium (SSD). DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional survey. SETTING: E-questionnaires were distributed to intensive care unit (ICU) nurses from 20 tertiary-grade, A-class hospitals in Henan Province, China. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 740 ICU nurses participated in the questionnaire survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Each dimension score is converted to a percentage scale. A score of ≤60% on each dimension of the questionnaire was considered a negative score, <80% was considered a intermediate score and ≥80% was considered an excellent score. RESULTS: A total of 733 questionnaires were included in the study. More than half of the nurses were at the intermediate level, and a few nurses were at the excellent level. Nurses self-assessed their level of knowledge was intermediate. In the attitudes dimension, nurses' attitudes were negative. The results of the practical dimension showed that most nurses could carry out the clinical practice. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that educational level and received SSD training were influencing factors. CONCLUSIONS: ICU nursing staff overestimated their knowledge of SSD and showed a negative attitude towards it. Various forms of education and training are necessary.",0
275,"BACKGROUND: Becoming critical ill or severely injured leads to a process of worry, anxiety and pain. Patients in intensive care sometimes have strange and frightening experiences and may show symptoms of acute confusion or delirium. CAM-ICU, the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit, was based on the DSM IV, the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders IV, and today, healthcare professionals and researchers are increasingly accepting this concept of diagnosing ICU delirium. In Sweden, there is no commonly used, single instrument or method to test the development of ICU delirium. The aim of this study was to translate, retranslate and validate CAM-ICU for use in Swedish ICU settings. METHODS: The translation of the instrument was done according to the guidelines suggested by The Translation and Cultural Adaptation group which includes preparation, forward translation/reconciliation, back translation, back translation review, harmonization, cognitive debriefing and validation. In the validation process, the applicability of the Swedish version of the instruments was tested in a Swedish intensive care unit. RESULTS: Fourteen adult patients were included in the study, 40 paired tests were carried out, and 80 CAM-ICU instruments were completed. The participating patients were given CAM-ICU ratings using independent paired evaluations by two nurses, specialized in intensive care, at least twice during the patients' stay in the ICU. Interrater reliability was calculated using kappa statistics. In the 40 paired observations, interrater reliability was 'very good' (kappa statistics > 0.81). In our material, we recognized a delirium rate of 48%, which is in accordance with previous studies. CONCLUSION: The translation of the instrument CAM-ICU showed good correlation with the original version and could therefore be applicable in a Swedish ICU setting. In the 40 paired observations, interrater reliability was very good. Although there are limitations in using CAM-ICU, previous studies reveal a need for a homogeneous screening instrument making it possible to detect and determine ICU delirium; and from this basis are able to implement and make the necessary decisions required in medical and nursing care practice preventing ICU delirium.",0
276,"CONTEXT: Excessive alcohol consumption is the nation's third leading cause of preventable deaths. If untreated, 6% of alcohol-dependent patients experience alcohol withdrawal, with up to 10% of those experiencing delirium tremens (DT), when they stop drinking. Without routine screening, patients often experience DT without warning. OBJECTIVE: Reduce the incidence of alcohol withdrawal advancing to DT, restraint use, and transfers to the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients with DT. DESIGN: In October 2009, the alcohol withdrawal team instituted a care management guideline used by all disciplines, which included tools for screening, assessment, and symptom management. Data were obtained from existing datasets for three quarters before and four quarters after implementation. Follow-up data were analyzed and showed a great deal of variability in transfers to the ICU and restraint use. Percentage of patients who developed DT showed a downward trend. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of alcohol withdrawal advancing to DT and, in patients with DT, restraint use and transfers to the ICU. RESULTS: Initial data revealed a decrease in percentage of patients with alcohol withdrawal who experienced DT (16.4%-12.9%). In patients with DT, restraint use decreased (60.4%-44.4%) and transfers to the ICU decreased (21.6%-15%). Follow-up data indicated a continued downward trend in patients with DT. Changes were not statistically significant. Restraint use and ICU transfers maintained postimplementation levels initially but returned to preimplementation levels by third quarter 2012. CONCLUSION: Early identification of patients for potential alcohol withdrawal followed by a standardized treatment protocol using symptom-triggered dosing improved alcohol withdrawal management and outcomes.",0
277,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common occurrence for patients in the intensive care unit and can have a profound and lasting impact on them. Few studies describe the experience of intensive care patients who have had delirium. OBJECTIVE: To understand the lived experience of intensive care for critically ill patients who experienced delirium. METHODS: The study participants consisted of 7 men and 3 women, 46 to 70 years old, who had delirium according to the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. The van Manen method of hermeneutic phenomenology was used, and data collection entailed audio recorded semistructured interviews. RESULTS: Four themes were detected: ""I can't remember,"" ""Wanting to make a connection,"" ""Trying to get it straight,"" and ""Fear and safety concerns."" CONCLUSION: Nurses working in intensive care units need to assess patients for delirium, assess the mental status of patients who have delirium, and help patients and patients' families learn about and deal with the psychological effects of the intensive care unit experience.",0
278,"BACKGROUND: Complex, interconnected issues challenge the United States health care system and the patients and families it serves. System fragmentation, limited resources, rigid disciplinary boundaries, institutional culture, ineffective communication, and uncertainty surrounding health policy legislation are contributing to suboptimal care delivery and patient outcomes. METHODS: These problems are too complex to be solved by a single discipline. Interdisciplinary research affords the opportunity to examine and solve some of these problems from a more integrative perspective using innovative and rigorous methodological designs. RESULTS: In this paper, we explore lessons learned from exemplars funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Interdisciplinary Nursing Quality Research Initiative. DISCUSSION: The discussion is framed using an adaptation of the Interdisciplinary Research Model to evaluate improvements in individual health outcomes, health systems, and health policy. Barriers and facilitators to designing, conducting, and translating interdisciplinary research are discussed. Implications for health system and policy changes, including the need to provide funding mechanisms to implement interdisciplinary processes in both research and clinical practice, are provided.",0
279,"Delirium is a serious complication of pediatric critical illness. Sleep disruption is frequently observed in children with delirium, and circadian rhythm dysregulation is one proposed cause of delirium. Children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) experience multiple environmental exposures with the potential to disrupt sleep. Although researchers have measured PICU light and sound exposure, sleep, and delirium, these variables have not yet been fully explored in a single study. Furthermore, caregiving patterns have not often been included as a component of the PICU environment. Measuring the light and sound exposure, caregiving patterns, and sleep of critically ill children requires continuous PICU bedside data collection. This presents multiple methodological challenges. In this paper, we describe the protocol for an observational pilot study of the PICU environment, sleep, and delirium experienced by a sample of 10 critically ill children 1-4 years of age. We also evaluate and discuss the feasibility (i.e., acceptability, implementation, practicality) of the study protocol. Light and sound exposure were measured with bedside sensors. Caregiving was quantified through video recording. Sleep was measured via actigraphy and confirmed by video recording. Delirium screening with the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium was conducted twice daily, either in person or via video review. This study provides a refined measurement framework to inform future, large-scale studies and the development of nurse-driven sleep promotion interventions.",0

281,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nonoperating room anesthesia (NORA) presents a unique opportunity for the application of value-based care (VBC) principles to procedures performed in the office-based and nonoperating room inpatient settings. The purpose of this article is to review how value is defined in NORA and enabling principles by which anesthesiologists can maximize value in NORA. RECENT FINDINGS: In order to drive value, NORA providers can target improvements in clinical outcomes where NORA lags behind operating room-based anesthesia (death, over-sedation, nerve injury), implement protocols focusing on intermediate outcomes/quality (postoperative nausea and vomiting, pain control, hypothermia, delirium), incorporate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to assess the trajectory of a patient's perioperative care, and reduce costs (direct and indirect) through operational and supply-based efficiencies. Establishing a culture of patient and provider safety first, appropriate patient selection with targeted, perioperative optimization of comorbidities, and efficient deployment of staff, space, and resources are critical enablers for success. SUMMARY: Value in NORA can be defined as clinical outcomes, quality, patient-reported outcomes, and efficiency divided by the direct and indirect costs for achieving those outcomes. We present a novel framework adapting current VBC practices in operating room anesthesia to the NORA environment.",0
282,"Dr. Ibrahim Fawzy Hassan Local Host and QCCC 2019 Conference Chair Dear Friends and Colleagues, It is an honour to welcome everyone to the first Qatar Critical Care Conference (QCCC). It has been a long journey to make it happen, but this event has been much awaited by the local critical care community. Over the last few years, we have hosted a number of related events of various scales, ranging from Critical Care Grand Rounds targeting Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) critical care clinicians, ran specialised courses, through to organising an international medical conference on extracorporeal life support in 2017.1 This inaugural QCCC event is the fruit of much planning and collaboration. The programme spans from 28th to 31st October 2019 and consists of two days of pre-conference workshops and two days for the main conference. The vast majority of the pre-conference workshops will be held in the state-of-the-art ITQAN Clinical Simulation and Innovation Centre located within Hamad bin Khalifa Medical City. Although the facility is yet to be offically inaugurated and opened, we have the privilege to have been granted access to it as a way of showcasing our forthcoming continuing professional development capability. ""Itqan"" in Arabic means quality and striving for perfection, which is very much in line with the mission of our established Critical Care Network (CCNW).2 Simulation-based education is an area in which we have started to be very active through various immersive courses as well as innovative technological developments to train our extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) specialists.3,4 The scientific part of the conference will be hosted in the iconic Sheraton Grand Doha Resort & Convention Hotel in the West Bay area. It includes a varied selection of topics presented by many renowned experts in their respective domain. This comprehensive programme with a line-up of lectures and workshops addressing e-CPR, ECMO simulation, ECMO cannulation, hemodynamics and so much more will facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experiences to improve patient care in Qatar and beyond. We anticipate that the programme will appeal to a broad audience and hence will bring together clinicians from all professions involved with caring for acutely ill patients. It is QCCC's aim to connect and explore new insights and expertise at a national and international level through networking with other professionals in a multidisciplinary setting. We hope that during this event many fruitful discussions will take place and that it will enhance opportunities for collaboration to develop everyone's practice in critical care. The HMC Critical Care family has a capacity of 163 and 109 intensive care unit (UCI) beds, respectively for adult and paediatric patients, across 7 hospitals spread throughout Qatar. These numbers are complemented by another 52 adult and paediatric beds from non-HMC hospitals. This gives us a national ICU bed capacity of 11.8 per 100,000 inhabitants considering a current population of nearly 2,750,000 inhabitants.5 Although this number remains below the international benchmark which can be considered to be around 15/100,000 population,6 this quota in Qatar has more than quadrupled over the last ten years, which represents a very significant improvement in the care that can be provided to acutely ill patients. Within HMC only, it is supported by a workforce of 159 intensive care physicians, 1122 intensive care nurses, and many other clinical staff, all of whom undergo a well regulated programme of continuing professional development and are licensed to practise by the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners (QCHP).7 The work they do across the various sites is coordinated and monitored by the CCNW2 who ensures the best level of care, up-to-date technology, and evidence-based practices are consistently adopted for the wellbeing of our patients. Once again, on behalf of the Scientific and Organizing Committees, it is my pleasure to welcome you all to Doha and we hope that you enjoy and gain meaningful insights during the conference regarding our local critical care setting and practices, but also learn from the experiences and best practices shared by our international guest speakers. Prof. Guillaume Alinier Guest Managing Editor, Qatar Medical Journal QCCC Special Issue and Abstracts Chair of the QCCC Scientific Committee. Dear Contributors and Conferences Delegates, Welcome to this special issue of the Qatar Medical Journal (QMJ) which has been dedicated to the inaugural conference of the Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) Qatar Critical Care Network (QCCN) which celebrates its fifth anniversary in 2019. I would like to start by thanking everyone who has supported this arduous publication endeavour through their extended abstract submission(s) and the reviewers for the valuable feedback they have provided to the authors to ensure this publication is a representative legacy of the calibre of this conference which includes many local and international experts in their respective field of practice or interest. All the accepted abstracts are being published Open Access thanks to the support of the conference sponsors and this contributes greatly to the sharing of experiences and best practices worldwide, but also showcases the good work that is being done in Qatar in the domain of critical care thanks to the work of dedicated clinicians and the leadership of the CCNW.2 Being the Guest Managing Editor of the special issue of a journal is an honour but also an arduous task, especially when a large number of submissions from international authors needs to be handled. It is the second time that I have accepted to take on that role for Qatar Medical Journal as the previous time was in 2017 on the occasion of hosting the South West Asia and African Chapter (SWAAC) of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation (ELSO) in Doha.1 This was only a couple of years after HMC had established its Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) programme, and it was a very successful event with many of its associated open access publications having been downloaded hundreds of times from the QScience.com publishing platform. Working on this new Special Issue really made me reflect on how the domain of critical care is vast and encompasses so many aspects of patient care and so many professions and specialties. The topics of the abstracts published in this special issue of QMJ cover dietetics,8 sepsis,9 delirium,10,11 physical therapy,12 end of life care and organ donation,13,14 dealing with families,15 as well as education and training of clinicians,16,17 to only highlight a few. Critical care is fast moving as new clinical practices and technological innovations are adopted and contribute to continuously improving patient care. This is especially true in Qatar where significant investments are constantly made to develop and support healthcare in a strategic way.18 At HMC, the critical care phase that some patients have to go through so their medical needs can be met is well integrated across all stakeholder departments that can possibly be involved.2 The patient's journey through the healthcare system can be seen as a continuum of care facilitated by the fact that all parties involved belong to the same overarching organisation, HMC, which is the government funded main provider of secondary and tertiary healthcare in Qatar. This means that from initial contact with the Ambulance Service bringing a patient to the Emergency Department for example, right through to rehabilitation and even possible access upon discharge to a mobile healthcare service supported by family physicians, nurses, and paramedics, patients can expect the same high standards of care.19 Critical care provision relies on multidisciplinary communication during transition of care as well as during any acute episode. This needs to be underpinned by medical knowledge and understanding of the potential contributions of other professions as nothing can be left to chance when a patient's life is hanging by a thread. The present collection of editorials and abstracts brings different perspectives on a broad range of topics which should be highly relevant to all clinicians involved with critical care and contribute to improving patient outcome and satisfaction, and hence that of the multidisciplinary team members also involved in caring for them. We hope that the Qatar Medical Journal Special Issue publications on critical care meets your needs and expectations. The complete record of QCCC publications including additional open access abstracts and editorials relating to this conference will be made available in Qatar Medical Journal at the following link: https://www.qscience.com/content/journals/qmj. Thanks again to everyone for your contributions, and beyond our email communications, I now hope to meet you in person during the conference!",0
284,"The purpose of this descriptive, exploratory study was to examine the current use, metadata, and availability of delirium data elements in an electronic health record and clinical data repository. The investigation explored risk for ICU delirium by comparing the delirium data elements representing nursing practice at one clinical agency with a Synthesis of evidence-based practice recommendations developed for the Knowledge-Based Nursing Initiative. The analysis provided a description of the representation of data elements and issues related to the availability of data for use in the future development of clinical decision support system that was intended to prevent ICU delirium. Content analysis and descriptive statistics were used to categorize and analyze the instance-level data from the convenience sample of 1714 patients. Forty-one data element categories were derived from the synthesis based on nursing process components and were matched to 160 data elements identified in the clinical agency's electronic health record. The matched data elements were primarily text based, entered by RNs using flow sheets and care planning documentation. Even though there was a high number of potential data element matches, there was considerable variable data availability related to clinical, conceptual, and technical factors. The further development of valid and reliable data that accurately capture the interaction between nurse, patient, and family is necessary before embarking on electronic clinical decision support.",0
285,"BACKGROUND: Delirium in the intensive care unit is associated with poor patient outcomes. Recent studies support nonpharmacological therapy, including cognitive stimulation, to address delirium. Understanding barriers to cognitive stimulation implemented by nurses during clinical care is essential to translating evidence into practice. OBJECTIVE: To use qualitative methods through a structured quality improvement project to understand nurses' perceived barriers to implementing a cognitive stimulation intervention in a medical intensive care unit. METHODS: Data were collected through semistructured interviews with nurses in a medical intensive care unit. Data were categorized into themes by using thematic analysis and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. During cognitive stimulation, nurses reviewed with patients a workbook of evidence-based tasks (focused on math, alertness, motor skills, visual perception, memory, problem-solving, and language). RESULTS: The 23 nurses identified 62 barriers to and 26 facilitators of cognitive stimulation. These data were summarized into 12 barrier and 9 facilitator themes corresponding to the following Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research domains: Intervention Characteristics, Outer Setting, Inner Setting, and Characteristics of Individuals. Nurses also identified several facilitators within the Process domain. Patient-specific variables, including sedation, were the most frequently reported barriers. Other barriers included cognitive stimulation not being prioritized, nursing staff-related issues, documentation burden, and a lack of understanding of, or appreciation for, the evidence supporting cognitive stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of cognitive stimulation requires a multidisciplinary approach to address perceived barriers arising from the organization, context, and individuals associated with the intervention, as well as the intervention itself.",0
286,"Objective: This study's objective is to establish a nurse-led pain management model for neurointensive care based on the Precede-Proceed model to provide a theoretical basis for clinical pain management in neurointensive care. Methods. ICU nurses were randomly divided into a control group (giving conventional routine pain care) and an experimental group (managed pain based on the Precede-Proceed model). The nurses from the experimental group were trained in the Precede-Proceed-based management. The nurses then treated a total of 410 critically ill patients, and the patients were randomly divided into a control and an intervention group (205 cases/nursing group), and the data were prospectively recorded. Before and after the intervention, the pain assessment ability, discomfort level, satisfaction degree, usage of the analgesic drug, and the incidence of delirium of the patients from the two groups were evaluated. Nurses from both groups also assessed their knowledge of pain, attitude, and pain nursing behaviors using indicated self-designed questionnaires. Results: Before the intervention, there was no statistical difference between the two groups of nurses in their baseline characteristics, pain knowledge, attitude, pain nursing behavior, and pain assessment ability for the patients. After the intervention, the nurses in the experimental group had better pain knowledge, attitude, pain nursing behavior, and pain assessment ability to patients than the nurses in the control group. Patients in the intervention group felt less discomfort, a higher satisfaction degree, reduced use of analgesics, and a lower incidence of delirium than patients in the control group. Conclusion. Pain management based on the Precede-Proceed model was beneficial in improving the care of neurointensive patients.",0
287,"BACKGROUND: Delirium affects up to 80% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) but is missed in up to 75% of cases. Telehealth in the ICU (tele-ICU) has become the standard for providing timely, expert care to remotely located ICUs. OBJECTIVES: This pilot study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of using tele-ICU to increase the accuracy of delirium screening and recognition by ICU nurses. METHODS: The pilot sites included 4 ICUs across 3 hospitals. A geriatrician with delirium expertise remotely observed 13 bedside ICU nurses administering the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) to patients in real time via the tele-ICU platform and subsequently provided training on CAM-ICU performance and delirium management. Training evaluation consisted of a validated spot check form, a 2-item satisfaction/change-of-practice survey, and a qualitative question on acceptability. RESULTS: Thirteen ICU nurses were observed performing 26 bedside delirium assessments. The top observed barriers to accurate delirium screening were CAM-ICU knowledge deficits, establishment of baseline cognition, and inappropriate use of the ""unable to assess"" designation. The mean percentage of correct observations improved from 40% (first observation) to 90% (second observation) (P < .001). All 13 nurses strongly agreed that the training was beneficial and practice changing. CONCLUSIONS: The use of tele-ICU to improve the accuracy of delirium screening by ICU nurses appears to be feasible and efficient for leveraging delirium expertise across multiple ICUs. Future studies should evaluate the effects of tele-ICU delirium training on patient-centered outcomes.",0
288,"BACKGROUND: Managing anxiety, pain and delirium in critically ill patients is an ongoing challenge. Differences in physician practice, variations of pharmacological agents, as well as concentrations and units can increase the risk of medication error Personal preferences, subjectivity, and nurses' level of expertise are variables when titrating analgesic and sedation infusions. PURPOSE: The purpdse of this study was to evaluate the perceived benefits of implementing a standardized nurse-driven sedation protocol in the ICU. We examined its impact on the rates of medication errors and perceptions of staff using the protocol. DESIGN: This descriptive study used a survey to collect data. SAMPLE: We used a convenience sample of 75 nurses who worked in the ICU during the implementation of the sedation protocol. RESULTS: Analysis of variance was completed comparing all sub-scale scores. No statistical significance was found, but scores did not decrease over time. No medication errors or near misses were reported throughout the sedation protocol implementation. Qualitative comments from staff provided feedback and assisted in identifying issues with the protocol. CONCLUSION: We believe that the implementation of the sedation protocol has been beneficial in our adult ICU. Findings indicate that with experience and resources nurses can manage anxiety, pain and delirium more confidently than without such a protocol. Critical care nurses, given the right tools, education, and support can make decisions that promote positive outcomes for patients receiving sedation and analgesia in the ICU.",0
289,"BACKGROUND: In Korea, regular screening for delirium is not considered essential. In addition, delirium is often associated with vague concepts, making it harder to identify high-risk patients and impeding decision-making. AIMS: To assess the impact of the Automatic PREdiction of DELirium in Intensive Care Units (APREDEL-ICU) system on nursing-sensitive and patient outcomes for surgical ICU patients and to evaluate nurse satisfaction with the system and its usability. METHODS: A pre-post research design was adopted. Our study included 724 patients admitted before the implementation of the APREDEL-ICU (January to December 2010) and 1111 patients admitted after the system was installed (May 2011 to April 2012). The APREDEL-ICU uses a pop-up window message to inform the nursing staff of patients at risk for delirium, allowing evidence-based nursing interventions to be applied to the identified patients. A total of 42 nurses were surveyed to determine the system's usability and their level of satisfaction with it. RESULTS: After the implementation of APREDEL-ICU, high-risk patients, determined using a prediction algorithm, showed a slight decrease in the incidence of delirium, but the changes were not significant. However, significant decreases in the number and duration of analgesic/narcotic therapies were observed after the implementation of the system. Nurse self-evaluation results showed an improvement in all categories of knowledge regarding delirium care. CONCLUSION: The use of a prediction and alerting system for ICU patients at high risk of delirium showed a potential increase in the quality of delirium care, including early detection and proper intervention.",0
290,"An important goal of the care for the mechanically ventilated patient is to minimize patient discomfort and anxiety. This is partly achieved by frequent use of chemical and physical restraints. The majority of patients in intensive care will receive some form of sedation. The goal and use of sedation has changed considerably over the past few decades with literature evidencing trends toward overall lighter sedation levels and daily interruption of sedation. Conversely, the use of physical restraint for the ventilated patient in ICU differs considerably between nations and continents. A large portion of the literature on the use of physical restraint is from general hospital wards and residential homes, and not from the ICU environment. Recent literature suggests minimal use of physical restraint in the ICU, and that reduction programmes have been initiated. However, very few papers illuminate the patient's experience of physical and chemical restraints as a treatment strategy. In Part 1 of this two-part review, the evidence on chemical and physical restraints was explored with specific focus on definitions of terms, unplanned extubation, agitation, delirium as well as the impact of nurse-patient ratios in the ICU on these issues. This paper, Part 2, examines the evidence related to chemical and physical restraints from the mechanically ventilated patient's perspective.",0
291,"BACKGROUND: As the last resort in intensive care units, physical restraint reduction is affected by various interventions. Several non-pharmacological interventions may directly reduce physical restraints, such as staff education, or indirectly reduce physical restraint, such as delirium prevention; however, their effectiveness has remained inconclusive. Therefore, we devised a protocol for umbrella reviews to summarize the evidence integrating data of different non-pharmacological interventions that may reduce physical restraint use. METHODS: The umbrella review will be conducted following the methodology formulated by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Psyc Articles, Psychology and Behavioral Science Collection, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), JBISRIS (JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, for Chinese literature), SinoMed (for Chinese literature), and WANFANG DATA (for Chinese literature), will be searched to identify articles published from January 2016 to December 2020. A systematic review and meta-analysis quality will be critically assessed by AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews). According to the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) guidelines, the evidence quality of each intervention will be assessed. Overlapping studies and the excess significance test will be performed to assess whether previous evidences are bias. DISCUSSION: This protocol was devised according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Umbrella reviews will be an excellent supplement to the evidence of the guideline adaptation and provide a broader picture of non-pharmacological interventions that may reduce the use of physical restraint, which can provide critical care nurses in intensive care units with the evidence they need. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This umbrella review protocol was documented in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42021242586).",0
292,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a neurobehavioural syndrome that frequently develops in the postoperative setting. The incidence of elderly patients who develop delirium during hospital stay ranges from 10-80%. Delirium was first described more than half a century ago in the cardiac surgery population, where it was already discovered as a state that might be accompanied by serious complications such as prolonged ICU and hospital stay, reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Furthermore, the duration of delirium is associated with worse long-term cognitive function in the general ICU population. This long-term experience with delirium suggests a high socioeconomic burden and has been a focus of many studies. Due to the multifactorial origin of delirium, we have several but no incontestable options for prevention and symptomatic treatment. Overall, delirium represents a high burden not only for patient and family members, but also for the medical care team that aims to prevent postoperative delirium to avoid serious consequences associated with it. The purpose of this study is to determine whether postoperative delirium can be prevented by the combination of established preventive agents. In addition, measured levels of pre- and postoperative cortisol, neuron specific enolase (NSE) and S-100β will be used to investigate dynamics of these parameters in delirious and non-delirious patients after surgery. METHODS/DESIGN: The Baden PRIDe Trial is an investigator-initiated, phase IV, two-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial for the prevention of delirium with haloperidol, ketamine, and the combination of both vs. placebo in 200 patients scheduled for surgery. We would like to investigate superiority of one of the three treatment arms (i.e., haloperidol, ketamine, combined treatment) to placebo. DISCUSSION: There is limited but promising evidence that haloperidol and ketamine can be used to prevent delirium. Clinical care for patients might improve as the results of this study may lead to better algorithms for the prevention of delirium. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02433041 .

293,"The confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) is a tool for screening for delirium in ventilated patients that with proper training can be administered quickly by staff nurses in the ICU. Unrecognized delirium can have a range of negative consequences, and in the elderly patients, it may be the first sign of an acute illness that, if left untreated, could result in death. Appropriate and early recognition is therefore imperative. Training staff to use the CAM-ICU requires not only a basic understanding of delirium and a firm orientation to the tool's features but also some preparatory decisions about tool usage and a defined approach to integrate the tool into the physical assessment process. Preparatory decisions include (1) how the tool will be used, (2) defining the process for identifying and recording baseline mental status, and (3) defining how documentation will occur. On the basis of the experience of teaching this tool to staff nurses, a 6-step process is explicated to facilitate integration: (1) putting it in context, (2) defining the features, (3) talking about tough cases, (4) doing the assessment, (5) documenting the assessment, and (6) continuing to discuss.",0
294,"Delirium is a common complication among patients in ICU settings. The accuracy of using the assessment tool CAM-ICU to detect delirium is relatively low during routine practice among bedside nurses. The aim of this study is to develop a mobile application (app) to detect delirium in early stage and to test its usability among ICU nurses. The app was developed with Java and installed on a mobile device. A questionnaire was created based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) measuring their response to the four domains of TAM: perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), attitudes towards usage (ATU) and behavioral intention to use (BIU). One hundred and two ICU nurses completed the survey. The result indicated that the app we developed has easy to use interfaces and is easier to use compared to the regular CAM-ICU.",0
295,"Cognitive recovery after anaesthesia and surgery is a concern for older adults, their families, and caregivers. Reports of patients who were 'never the same' prompted a scientific inquiry into the nature of what patients have experienced. In June 2018, the ASA Brain Health Initiative held a summit to discuss the state of the science on perioperative cognition, and to create an implementation plan for patients and providers leveraging the current evidence. This group included representatives from the AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons), American College of Surgeons, American Heart Association, and Alzheimer's Association Perioperative Cognition and Delirium Professional Interest Area. This paper summarises the state of the relevant clinical science, including risk factors, identification and diagnosis, prognosis, disparities, outcomes, and treatment of perioperative neurocognitive disorders. Finally, we discuss gaps in current knowledge with suggestions for future directions and opportunities for clinical and translational projects.",0
296,"BACKGROUND: A delirium, is a serious, high-frequency complication in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The consequences of this complication range from high morbidity and mortality to greater need for nursing care. Despite these, delirium is often not recognized and there for not treated. In this study a nursing screening instrument, the NEECHAM confusion scale, was studied for early recognition of delirium ICU patients. This scale proved valid and reliable in several studies in the general hospital population. METHODS: In this study validity and reliability were tested in a prospective cohort of 105 patients. Gold standard for delirium was an independent DSM-IV diagnosis. User friendliness was tested by structured evaluation of nurses' experiences working with the scale. RESULTS: The NEECHAM confusion scale showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.88) and an interrater reliability of Cohen's Kappa 0.60. The concurrent validity with the DSM-IVcriteria showed a strong link (chi-square 67.52, p [less than or equal to] 0.001). Sensitivity was high, 97% and specificity was good 83%. ICU nurses completed the NEECHAM confusion rating in 3.69, +/- 1.21 minutes average. In general the nurses were positive about the NEECHAM confusion scale. They were able to collect data during regular care, but experienced problems in rating the scale in intubated patients. The items in themselves were clear, the content validity, measured by the language used was rated good. CONCLUSION: The psychometric characteristics of the NEECHAM confusion scale of this ICU study are generally consistent with validity research previously reported for the general hospital population. The psychometric characteristics and the ease of use of the NEECHAM confusion scale enables ICU nurses to early recognize delirium. Further study, especially in intubed patients is recommended.",0
297,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the content of former intensive care unit patients' memories of delusions. BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit patients often have strange and frightening experiences during the critical stage of illness. Earlier studies have provided small-sample in-depth descriptions of patient experiences in intensive care unit, but large-scale studies are also needed to inform intensive care unit follow-up. METHODS: The study had a qualitative design using phenomenological hermeneutic analysis inspired by Ricoeur's interpretive theory. Patients were assessed with Confusion Assessment Method of the Intensive Care Unit for delirium in intensive care unit, and after discharge, memories of delusions were described by 114 of 325 patients in face-to-face (after two weeks) and telephone interviews (after two and six months) using the Intensive Care Unit Memory Tool. RESULTS: Four themes emerged: the ever-present family, dynamic spaces, surviving challenges and constant motion. Memories of delusions were a vivid mix of fact and fiction, demonstrating dynamic shifts in time, place and motion, but not dependent on the presence of delirium assessed by Confusion Assessment Method of the Intensive Care Unit. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis based on Ricoeurian phenomenological hermeneutics provided insights into themes in intensive care unit patients' memories of delusions. More studies are needed to understand the meaning of memories of delusions, the commonality of themes and the association between delusions and delirium after an intensive care unit stay. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Understanding patients' memories of delusions is beneficial to nurses caring for patients that are anxious, upset or agitated. It opens a window to the world of the patient who is unable to communicate due to intubation and general weakness. We recommend the provision of nurse-led intensive care unit follow-up enabling patients to describe and discuss their intensive care unit experiences.",0
298,"OBJECTIVES: This study has aimed to establish the intensivist physician's concepts and practices in this region regarding the diagnosis, management and prevention of delirium in intensive care units (ICU). DESIGN: A survey was distributed among the FEPIMCTI member societies for distribution among its medical members. RESULTS: Eight hundred fifty-four intensive care physicians from 12 Latin America countries, most of them from Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Colombia, responded to the survey. There was a majority of academic ICUs (70.5%). A total of 56.55% responded that they always evaluated the diagnosis of delirium and only 10.2% answered never. A general clinical assessment was made by 69.5%, only 19.6% used the CAM-ICU scale and 9% the checklist assessment of delirium. It was agreed or strongly agreed by 88.3% that delirium was an expected event in the ICU and by 90.1% that delirium was underdiagnosed in ICU. A total of 97% responded that it was a problem that requires intervention and which is preventable (66.5%). It was considered that excessive sedation is given in the ICU by 74.5% and 70.5% believed that opiates are associated with the onset of delirium, while 87.1% considered that some sedatives are associated with its development. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was considered as a risk factor by 70.2% of the respondents and 87.8% considered that it made extubation difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Although delirium is considered to be a common and preventable problem with serious implications for critically ill patients, the intensivist physicians surveyed do not use a tool for its evaluation in the ICU. Educational efforts are needed to disseminate the effectiveness and usefulness of the scales that allow for early and accurate diagnosis of delirium in the ICU.",0
299,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe respiratory dysfunction and post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which can significantly affect the return to work after discharge from the hospital. This report describes the first case of a patient with severe COVID-19 at our institution during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February to June 2020) who returned to work following rehabilitation management. CASE: A 48-year-old female nurse was admitted with COVID-19 and underwent mechanical ventilation (MV). Respiratory and anti-gravity training was conducted as physical therapy; however, the patient developed PICS, muscle weakness, delirium, and psychological problems. After the withdrawal of MV, muscle strengthening activities, activities of daily living (ADL) training, family visits, and occupational and speech therapy were started. On day 60 post-admission, the patient was able to perform ADL independently and was discharged; however, she continued to experience shortness of breath during exertion. Post-discharge, follow-up assessments for symptoms, respiratory function, and exercise capacity were continued. On day 130, she returned to work as a nurse. DISCUSSION: The PICS noted during hospitalization in this patient improved, but at discharge, the patient had difficulty completing the practical tasks involved in a nurse's workload. Follow-up assessments of symptoms, respiratory function, and exercise capacity after discharge helped to determine whether the patient could return to work.",0
300,"Objective: To evaluate the effect of intensive care unit (ICU) visit on the incidence of delirium, delirium subtype, and anxiety level in ICU patients. Methods: Trained psychiatrists and nurses evaluated ICU patients for delirium, delirium subtypes, and anxiety. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to retrospectively analyze the data. Then, we compared the differences in the incidence of delirium, delirium subtypes, and anxiety level before and after the ICU visit ban. Logistic regression was conducted to identify the risk factors for delirium subtypes and high anxiety levels. Results: After PSM, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of delirium between the non-visiting and restrictive visiting groups (non-visiting 27.4% versus restrictive visiting 30.9%, p = 0.162). The proportion of hyperactive and mixed subtypes was higher in the non-visiting than in the restrictive visiting group (non-visiting 35.3 and 30.1% versus restrictive visiting 27.7 and 20.1%, p = 0.002). The anxiety level was higher in the non-visiting than in the restrictive visiting group (state-trait anxiety inventory score: non-visiting 53.46 ± 4.58 versus restrictive visiting 52.22 ± 6.50, p = 0.009). Patients who stayed in the ICU during the visit ban were more likely to have hyperactive (p = 0.005) and mixed subtype (p = 0.001) than those who did not. Moreover, patients who stayed in the ICU during the visit ban were more likely to experience high anxiety levels than those who did not (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Prohibition of ICU visits during COVID-19 pandemic did not affect the incidence of delirium during COVID-19 but could change the delirium subtype and raise anxiety level. Moreover, visiting prohibition was a risk factor for non-hypoactive delirium subtype and high anxiety levels. Therefore, ICU visits are important in dealing with delirium subtypes and anxiety in ICU patients.",0

302,"BACKGROUND: A recent paradigm shift within the intensive care discipline has led to implementation of protocols to drive early recovery from the intensive care unit (ICU). These protocols belong to a large knowledge, translation and quality improvement initiative lead by the Society of Critical Care Medicine, aiming to ""liberate"" patients from the ICU. They ""bundle"" evidence-based elements shown to lower ICU stay and mortality and optimize pain management. The bundled elements focus on Assessing, preventing and managing pain; Both spontaneous awakening trials and spontaneous breathing trials; Choice of analgesia and sedation; assessment, prevention, and management of Delirium; Early mobility and exercise; and Family engagement and empowerment (ABCDEF). It is evident that analgesia and sedation protocols either directly relate to or influence most of the bundle elements. A paucity of literature exists for neurologically injured patients, who create unique challenges to bundle implementation and often have limited external validity in existent studies. We will systematically search the literature, present the unique challenges of neurointensive care patients, conduct a stratified analysis of subgroups of interest, and disseminate the evidence of analgesia and sedation protocols in the neurointensive care unit (NICU). We hope the relevant stakeholders can adapt this information through knowledge translation-to make formal recommendations in clinical practice guidelines or a position statement. METHODS/DESIGN: The authors will search MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and the National Institutes for Health Clinical Trials Registry. The title, abstract, and full-text screening will be completed in duplicate, and a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of agreement will be reported. Provided the data retrieved from studies is suitable, results will be combined statistically using meta-analysis. We aim to evaluate the impact of ABCDEF bundle components on multiple endpoints of NICU recovery. Our primary outcomes will be time to successful discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and time to early mobility. The authors will guide the methodological design of the study using the PRISMA-statement and the checklist compliance will be available. DISCUSSION: Using the evidence from this systematic review, we anticipate disseminating knowledge of analgesia and sedation protocols in the NICU. The results of this systematic review are imperative to close the knowledge gap in a patient population that is often excluded from studies, and to add to the body of literature aiming to enhance early recovery from the NICU and mitigate iatrogenic harm.

303,"INTRODUCTION: In critically ill patients, delirium is a serious and frequent disorder that is associated with a prolonged intensive care and hospital stay and an increased morbidity and mortality. Without the use of a delirium screening instrument, delirium is often missed by ICU nurses and physicians. The effects of implementation of a screening method on haloperidol use is not known. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of the confusion assessment method-ICU (CAM-ICU) and the effect of its use on frequency and duration of haloperidol use. METHODS: We used a tailored implementation strategy focused on potential barriers. We measured CAM-ICU compliance, interrater reliability, and delirium knowledge, and compared the haloperidol use, as a proxy for delirium incidence, before and after the implementation of the CAM-ICU. RESULTS: Compliance and delirium knowledge increased from 77% to 92% and from 6.2 to 7.4, respectively (both, P < 0.0001). The interrater reliability increased from 0.78 to 0.89. More patients were treated with haloperidol (9.9% to 14.8%, P < 0.001), however with a lower dose (18 to 6 mg, P = 0.01) and for a shorter time period (5 [IQR:2-9] to 3 [IQR:1-5] days, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: With a tailored implementation strategy, a delirium assessment tool was successfully introduced in the ICU with the main goals achieved within four months. Early detection of delirium in critically ill patients increases the number of patients that receive treatment with haloperidol, however with a lower dose and for a shorter time period.",0
304,"BACKGROUND: Pain and agitation are common experiences of patients in pediatric cardiac intensive care units. Variability in assessments by health care providers, communication, and treatment of pain and agitation creates challenges in management of pain and sedation. OBJECTIVES: To develop guidelines for assessment and treatment of pain, agitation, and delirium in the pediatric cardiac intensive unit in an academic children's hospital and to document the effects of implementation of the guidelines on the interprofessional team's perception of care delivery and team function. METHODS: Before and after implementation of the guidelines, interprofessional team members were surveyed about the members' perception of analgesia, sedation, and delirium management RESULTS: Members of the interprofessional team felt more comfortable with pain and sedation management after implementation of the guidelines. Team members reported improvements in team communication on patients' comfort. Members thought that important information was less likely to be lost during transfer of care. They also noted that the team carried out comfort management plans and used pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies better after implementation of the guidelines than they did before implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines for pain and sedation management were associated with perceived improvements in team function and patient care by members of the interprofessional team.",0
305,"BACKGROUND: Despite emphasis on identifying personal and clinical characteristics that place patients at higher risk for posttraumatic stress syndrome after intensive care, the extent of screening for the syndrome in intensive care patients is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To examine the feasibility and acceptability of a screening tool to detect posttraumatic stress syndrome, screen for the syndrome soon after discharge from intensive care to identify patients at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and determine personal and clinical factors related to higher scores on the screening instrument. METHODS: A single-center, cross-sectional design was used. At 2 to 4 weeks after hospital discharge, 41 patients treated in an intensive care unit completed the screening instrument and the Screening Experience Questionnaire via telephone. Associations between participants' characteristics and scores were examined, and screening experiences were described. RESULTS: Participants reported that the screening instrument was easy to understand, caused little distress, and could be completed in an acceptable time frame. Participants reported that they had not been screened via a formal process or received education during or after their stay in the unit. Among the participants, 44% preferred screening in the outpatient setting. Higher scores on the screening tool were associated with history of depression, moderate levels of sedation, and intensive care unit delirium. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of intensive care patients most likely are not being screened for posttraumatic stress syndrome despite a higher risk for the syndrome in these patients than in the general population.",0
306,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between observed delirium in ICU and patients' recall of factual events up to two years after discharge. BACKGROUND: People, the environment, and procedures are frequently cited memories of actual events encountered in ICU. These are often perceived as stressors to the patients and the presence of several such stressors has been associated with the development of reduced health-related quality of life or post-traumatic stress syndrome. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study using interview technique. METHOD: The cohort was assembled from 152 patients who participated in a previously conducted multi-centre study of delirium incidence in Australian ICUs. The interviews involved a mixture of closed- and open-ended questions. Qualitative responses regarding factual memories were analysed using thematic analysis. A five-point Likert scale with answers from 'always' to 'never' was used to ask about current experiences of dream, anxiety, sleep problems, fears, irritability and/or mood swings. Scoring ranged from 6 to 30 with a mid-point value of 18 indicating a threshold value for the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress syndrome. A P-value of <0.05 was considered significant for all analyses. RESULTS: Forty-one (40%) out of 103 potential participants consented to take part in the follow-up interview; 18 patients (44%) had been delirious and 23 patients (56%) non-delirious during the ICU admission. The non-participants (n = 62) formed a control group to ensure a representative sample; 83% (n = 34) reported factual memories either with or without recall of dreaming. Factual memories were significantly less common (66% cf. 96%) in delirious patients (OR 0.09, 95%CI 0.01-0.85, p = 0.035). Five topics emerged from the thematic analysis: 'procedures', 'staff', 'comfort', 'visitors', and 'events'. Based on the current experiences, five patients (12%, four non-delirious and one delirious) scored > or =18 indicative of symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome; this did not reach statistical significance. Memory of transfer out of ICU was less frequent among the delirious patients (56%, n = 10) than among the non-delirious patients (87%, n = 20) (p = 0.036). CONCLUSION: Most patients have factual memories of their ICU stay. However, delirious patients had significantly less factual recall than non-delirious patients. Adverse psychological sequelae expressed as post-traumatic stress syndrome was uncommon in our study. Every attempt must be made to ensure that the ICU environment is as hospitable as possible to decrease the stress of critical illness. Post-ICU follow-up should include filling in the 'missing gaps', particularly for delirious patients. Ongoing explanations and a caring environment may assist the patient in making a complete recovery both physically and mentally. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study highlights the need for continued patient information, re-assurance and optimized comfort. While health care professionals cannot remove the stressors of the ICU treatments, we must minimize the impact of the stay. It must be remembered that most patients are aware of their surroundings while they are in the ICU and it should, therefore, be part of ICU education to include issues regarding all aspects of patient care in this particularly vulnerable subset of patients to optimize their feelings of security, comfort and self-respect.",0
307,"Delirium is a well recognised and serious problem in adult intensive care patients. With a reported incidence as high as 87%, it has been associated with increased length of stay, higher costs of care, ongoing cognitive impairment and increased mortality rates. The problem is so significant that routine, formal delirium assessment is recommended for all intensive care patients. However, there is evidence to suggest that few intensive care nurses are incorporating this screening into their daily practice. The aim of this paper is to discuss what is currently known about intensive care nurses' attitudes and beliefs in relation to caring for adults who are experiencing delirium, with a focus on identifying possible barriers to formal delirium assessment. It will be argued that intensive care nurses are well placed to perform regular delirium assessment and therefore have a responsibility to promote an improvement in delirium assessment practices.",0
308,"BACKGROUND: Surgeons and nurses sometimes perceive a high workload on the surgical wards, which may influence admission decisions and staffing policy. This study aimed to explore the relative contribution of various patient and care characteristics to the perceived patients' care intensity and whether differences exist in the perception of surgeons and nurses. METHODS: We invited surgeons and surgical nurses in the Netherlands for a conjoint analysis study through internet and e-mail invitations. They rated 20 virtual clinical scenarios regarding patient care intensity on a 10-point Likert scale. The scenarios described patients with 5 different surgical conditions: cholelithiasis, a colon tumor, a pancreas tumor, critical leg ischemia, and an unstable vertebral fracture. Each scenario presented a mix of 13 different attributes, referring to the patients' condition, physical symptoms, and admission and discharge circumstances. RESULTS: A total of 82 surgeons and 146 surgical nurses completed the questionnaire, resulting in 4560 rated scenarios, 912 per condition. For surgeons, 6 out of the 13 attributes contributed significantly to care intensity: age, polypharmacy, medical diagnosis, complication level, ICU-stay and ASA-classification, but not multidisciplinary care. For nurses, the same six attributes contributed significantly, but also BMI, nutrition status, admission type, patient dependency, anxiety or delirium during hospitalization, and discharge type. Both professionals ranked 'complication level' as having the highest impact. DISCUSSION: The differences between surgeons and nurses on attributes contributing to care intensity may be explained by differences in professional roles and daily work activities. Surgeons have a medical background, including technical aspects of their work and primary focus on patient curation. However, nurses are focused on direct patient care, i.e., checking vital functions, stimulating self-care and providing woundcare. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons and nurses differ in their perception of patients' care intensity. Appreciation of each other's differing interpretations might improve collaboration between doctors and nurses and may help managers to match hospital resources and personnel.",0
309,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a multifactorial syndrome closely associated with negative hospitalisation outcomes. Given the global growth of the ageing population, delirium becomes increasingly prevalent among older persons. Nurses play a pivotal role in delirium management and receive direct impacts of delirious presentations. Yet, there is a dearth of literature reviewing nurses' experiences. OBJECTIVE: To synthesise the best available evidence exploring nurses' experiences in managing delirium of older persons in acute care wards. DESIGN: Systematic review of qualitative studies and meta-aggregation. DATA SOURCES: Published and unpublished literature between January 2010 and December 2020 were identified from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, PsycINFO and ProQuest. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic search strategy was applied in October 2020, with an update in January 2021. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts and selected the eligible studies after reading the full texts. This review included studies focusing on licensed nurses providing care to patients aged 65 and above, having any type of delirium during their hospitalisation stays in acute care settings. Studies included are qualitative papers with research designs such as phenomenology, ethnography, qualitative descriptive and grounded theory. The eligible studies were appraised independently using The JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research. Data of included studies were extracted by two independent reviewers using a standardised form. Findings were synthesised by the meta-aggregative approach. RESULTS: Thirty-one papers that considered nurses' (n = 464) experiences in managing older persons' delirium were included. A total of 375 findings were extracted, aggregated into 23 categories, and developed 5 synthesised findings: (i) delirium detection could be hindered when nurses possess a narrowed view of delirium, (ii) nurses navigate through complexity when providing multi-faceted care, (iii) nurses carry personal emotions, assumptions, and identities, (iv) various stakeholders have double-edged influences, and (v) nurses display preferences in their learning needs. CONCLUSION: This review informed about nurses' perceptions of delirium, delirious older persons, and their nursing management which were specific to older persons and acute care settings. Nurses should practise self-awareness regarding their own knowledge and attitudes while performing delirium management in older adults. Meanwhile, healthcare professionals and policymakers should make a concerted effort in cultivating a better working environment. Future research of delirium care that specifically investigates with a geriatric perspective would better contribute to the improvement of evidence-based nursing practices for older persons.",0
310,"Overuse of sedation in patients treated with mechanical ventilation can increase duration of ventilation, duration of delirium, and time to discharge. Although current principles of care include implementation of sedation protocols and/or daily interruptions in sedation to improve patients' outcomes, these strategies remain underused. Historically, a barrier to use of protocols has been a perception that being awake and aware while intubated is intrinsically distressing and could cause psychological harm. Evidence of a link between lighter sedation and decreased signs and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder has partially dispelled these fears and even prompted the adoption of no-sedation (eg, analgosedation) strategies. Published studies on posttraumatic stress disorder and sedation are limited by small sample size, heterogeneous sedation practices, and inadequate follow-up. Despite limitations, current data suggest contemporary sedation practices to keep patients calm and comfortable but awake, as appropriate, are not associated with increased rates or severity of posttraumatic stress disorder.",0
311,"The high number of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus requiring care for ARDS puts sedation in the critical care unit (CCU) to the edge. Depth of sedation has evolved over the last 40 years (no-sedation, deep sedation, daily emergence, minimal sedation, etc.). Most guidelines now recommend determining the depth of sedation and minimizing the use of benzodiazepines and opioids. The broader use of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists ('alpha-2 agonists') led to sedation regimens beginning at admission to the CCU that contrast with hypnotics+opioids (""conventional"" sedation), with major consequences for cognition, ventilation and circulatory performance. The same doses of alpha-2 agonists used for 'cooperative' sedation (ataraxia, analgognosia) elicit no respiratory depression but modify the autonomic nervous system (cardiac parasympathetic activation, attenuation of excessive cardiac and vasomotor sympathetic activity). Alpha-2 agonists should be selected only in patients who benefit from their effects ('personalized' indications, as opposed to a 'one size fits all' approach). Then, titration to effect is required, especially in the setting of systemic hypotension and/or hypovolemia. Since no general guidelines exist for the use of alpha-2 agonists for CCU sedation, our clinical experience is summarized for the benefit of physicians in clinical situations in which a recommendation might never exist (refractory delirium tremens; unstable, hypovolemic, hypotensive patients, etc.). Because the physiology of alpha-2 receptors and the pharmacology of alpha-2 agonists lead to personalized indications, some details are offered. Since interactions between conventional sedatives and alpha-2 agonists have received little attention, these interactions are addressed. Within the existing guidelines for CCU sedation, this article could facilitate the use of alpha-2 agonists as effective and safe sedation while awaiting large, multicentre trials and more evidence-based medicine.",0
312,"AIM: To determine cues to identify intensive care unit patients with distorted memories and related practices. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study. METHODS: Twenty nurses were included in semi-structured focus groups. Qualitative content analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Cues and nursing practices related to distorted memories emerged under the following categories: ""Get to know daily life before admission,"" ""Facial expressions and behaviour are different from usual,"" ""Pay close attention to the treatment outcome,"" ""Notice it after the fact,"" ""Sharing patients' intensive care unit experiences"" and ""Creates a new life."" Nurses tried to detect distorted memories by observing the patients' facial expressions, medication effects and delirium presence during their normal lives and treatments, while trying to understand the patients' intensive care unit experiences and provide care that promotes autonomous living. This study emphasizes the importance of support for reconstructing ordinary life through communication and rehabilitation, in addition to support for medical care for distorted memories.",0
313,"Background: Prevention of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) in critically ill patients requires interprofessional collaboration among physicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and nutritionists. Interprofessional education promotes interprofessional collaborative practice, yet formalized interprofessional education during residency is uncommon. Objective: We sought to improve internal medicine residents' knowledge of interprofessional roles in the intensive care unit (ICU) and confidence in managing PICS by designing a virtual multimodal training module. Methods: We created a 3-hour virtual module with physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, and nutrition experts. First, learners reviewed PICS and multidisciplinary interventions to optimize patient recovery. Second, attendees watched videos created by physical therapy and occupational therapy colleagues demonstrating mobility strategies to manage ICU-acquired weakness and delirium. Third, participants learned how speech-language pathology experts evaluate and manage swallowing disorders. Finally, attendees identified common nutritional therapy challenges with a trivia session. Participants completed pre- and postcourse assessments. Results: Thirty-four residents completed both pre- and postcourse assessments (52% response rate). The mean objective assessment score improved from 51% to 79% (P < 0.001). All respondents reported that their knowledge of PICS increased, and almost all (97%) believed that their knowledge of interprofessional roles increased. Respondents' confidence in facilitating discussions about critical illness recovery significantly improved, from 77% rating as either not very confident or not at all confident before the course to 94% rating as somewhat confident or very confident after the course (P < 0.001). Conclusion: This single-site pilot study suggests that integrating interprofessional training in PICS education using virtual platforms may improve residents' knowledge of interprofessional roles in the ICU and confidence in managing PICS.",0
314,"BACKGROUND: delirium is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Understanding of delirium among doctors in medical and ICU settings has previously been shown to be low. We hypothesised that junior doctors who had gained experience in geriatrics, neurology or psychiatry may have an increased knowledge of delirium. METHODS: we used data from a large multi-centre study of junior doctors conducted between December 2006 and January 2007 which is, to date, the largest survey of understanding of delirium among junior doctors. The original survey used a questionnaire within which certain key items led to a correct or incorrect answer. Total correct answers were recorded giving a maximum total knowledge score of 17 for each participant. The relationship between total knowledge score achieved on the questionnaire and time since qualification; specialty experience in geriatric medicine, psychiatry and/or neurology and self-reported experience with the Confusion Assessment Method (independent variables) were modelled using linear regression. RESULTS: around half (53.2%; 399 of 750) of those surveyed stated that they had experience in geriatric medicine. In contrast only 4.1 and 8.0% of respondents had experience in psychiatry and neurology, respectively. Experience in geriatric medicine was significantly associated with a modest increase in correct answers (4.7 versus 4.3 points, P = 0.020). No other variables were significantly associated with better scores. CONCLUSION: experience in geriatric medicine leads to a small improvement in understanding of delirium among junior doctors.",0
315,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine qualitative research findings about family experiences of absence or loss during older person delirium, and provide a critical discussion of the similarities and differences in these experiences with conceptual understandings of absence and loss. BACKGROUND: Families who care for older people with chronic illnesses experience many losses. However, the nondeath loss experiences of family during an older loved one's delirium, an acute condition accompanied by marked changes in demeanour, have received little consideration. DESIGN: Discursive position paper. METHODS: The findings from two qualitative research studies about family experiences during an older loved one's delirium are discussed in relation to the concepts of absence and nondeath loss. RESULTS: The uncharacteristic behaviours and cognitive changes that accompany delirium may estrange family who, despite the older person's corporeal presence, sense the profound absence or loss of their loved one. Although the notion of absence, a nondeath loss, is similar to the experiences of family of people with chronic conditions, there are differences that distinguish these encounters. The similarities and differences between absence during delirium and the concepts of psychological absence, nonfinite loss and psychosocial death are discussed. Psychosocial death, reversibility/irreversibility and partial marked change, are suggested as conceptual descriptions for the absence families experience during an older loved one's delirium. CONCLUSIONS: The sense of absence or loss that family may experience during their older loved one's delirium needs to be recognised, understood and addressed by healthcare staff. Understanding or appreciating conceptualisations of absence, as a nondeath loss, may enhance understandings of family member needs during delirium and enable better support strategies. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Conceptualisations of absence enhance understandings of family distress and needs during their older loved one's delirium. The potential for family members to experience their loved one's absence during delirium, a nondeath loss, needs to be considered by healthcare staff. Family experiences of absence during delirium need to be recognised by healthcare staff, acknowledged as a potential source of distress, and considered when involving family in the older person's care. Nurses are ideally placed to respond compassionately and provide appropriate family member re-assurance, support and information during delirium. Information should include possible impacts on family and coping strategies.",0
316,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of and screening for delirium are important to patient care. As bedside caregivers, nurses are in a strategic position to observe changes that may indicate delirium. OBJECTIVE: To institute a delirium screening protocol in a pediatric intensive care unit using the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium. METHODS: Implementation strategies included cycles of education and repeated, timed compliance and accuracy assessments. Surveys administered before and 6 months after implementation were used to identify nurses' perceptions of screening. Compliance with and accuracy of screening were measured over 3 years. During the second and third years, text messages to bedside nurses' telephones served as screening reminders. RESULTS: Responses on the nursing surveys before (n = 89) and after (n = 74) implementation were compared. After implementation, time to complete the assessment, medical providers, and procedures were less likely to be perceived as obstacles to screening. Nurses' confidence in delirium screening improved over time. Accuracy increased from 60% during the first year to 100% during the second and third years (P < .05). Unit-wide compliance with delirium screening was 68% in the first year, 51% in the second year, and 72% in the third year, a trend toward improvement that was statistically significant (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Although unit-wide compliance with the screening protocol decreased without regular monitoring, it subsequently improved after the institution of reminders and reeducation of nursing staff. Nursing perceptions evolved to view screening as an important component of patient care that did not disrupt daily workflow.",0
317,"The intensive care unit syndrome (ICU syndrome) is defined as an altered emotional state occurring in a highly stressful environment, which may manifest itself in various forms such as delirium, confusion, crazy dreams or unreal experiences. The purpose of this part of a study of patients' experiences is to describe and illuminate patients' experiences of acute confusion, disorientation, wakefulness, dreams and nightmares during and after their stay in the ICU. The data were obtained from 19 ventilated patients, who were interviewed twice and had stayed at least 36 hours in the ICU, the first interview being about one week after discharge from the ICU, and the second 4-8 weeks later. The hermeneutic approach used when interpreting and analysing the text from the interviews revealed that patients' experiences of unreal experiences were often associated with intense fear. Intense or continuous unbearable fear seems to result in frightening unreal experiences, which further increase the level of fear. Care actions or caring relationships with relatives or nurses can reduce this fear, which can help to prevent the occurrence and/or duration and intensity of the unreal experiences. Trust and confidence in nurses or significant others and feelings of self-control or trust in self-control seemed to reduce the risk of unreal experiences so that adverse stimuli might only trigger a mild confusion.",0
318,"INTRODUCTION: Critical care nurses are responsible for administering sedative medications to mechanically ventilated patients. With significant advancements in the understanding of the impact of sedative exposure on physiological and psychological outcomes of ventilated patients, updated practice guidelines for assessment and management of pain, agitation, and delirium in the intensive care unit were released in 2013. The primary aim of this qualitative study was to identify and describe themes derived from critical care nurses' comments regarding sedation administration practices with mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: This is a qualitative content analysis of secondary text data captured through a national electronic survey of members of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. A subsample (n = 67) of nurses responded to a single, open-ended item at the end of a survey that evaluated nurses' perceptions of current sedation administration practices. FINDINGS: Multiple factors guided sedation administration practices, including individual patient needs, nurses' synthesis of clinical evidence, application of best practices, and various personal and professional practice perspectives. Our results also indicated nurses desire additional resources to improve their sedation administration practices including more training, better communication tools, and adequate staffing. CONCLUSIONS: Critical care nurses endorse recommendations to minimise sedation administration when possible, but a variety of factors, including personal perspectives, impact sedation administration in the intensive care unit and need to be considered. Critical care nurses continue to encounter numerous challenges when assessing and managing sedation of mechanically ventilated patients.",0
319,"AIMS: To explore the experiences of family carers of people with cognitive impairment during admission to hospital. BACKGROUND: Providing appropriate care in acute hospitals for people with co-morbid cognitive impairment, especially dementia or delirium or both, is challenging to healthcare professionals. One key element is close working with family members. DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with family carers of 34 older people who had been admitted to a UK general hospital and had co-morbid cognitive impairment. Interviews conducted in 2009 and 2010. Analysis was undertaken using Strauss and Corbin's framework. FINDINGS: The findings elaborate a core problem, 'disruption from normal routine' and a core process, 'gaining or giving a sense of control to cope with disruption'. Family carers responded to disruption proactively by trying to make sense of the situation and attempting to gain control for themselves or the patient. They tried to stay informed, communicate with staff about the patient and plan for the future. The interaction of the core problem and the core process resulted in outcomes where family members either valued the support of hospital staff and services or were highly critical of the care provided. CONCLUSION: Family carers are not passive in the face of the disruption of hospitalization and respond both by trying to involve themselves in the care and support of their relative and by trying to work in partnership with members of staff. Nurses need to foster this relationship conscientiously.",0
320,"An advanced practice nurse (APN) often encounters patients with alterations in neurologic functioning, regardless of the practice setting. In many situations, the APN will be asked to perform the initial evaluation and determine if additional testing and consultation are indicated. For the APN who does not routinely encounter these patients, the experience may be challenging. This article presents an organized approach to the examination of patients with alterations in mentation and level of consciousness and considerations for differential diagnosis.",0
321,"IMPORTANCE: Sleep has major consequences for physical and emotional well-being. Hospitalized patients experience frequent iatrogenic sleep interruptions and there is evidence that such interruptions can be safely reduced. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a clinical decision support tool, powered by real-time patient data and a trained prediction algorithm, can help physicians identify clinically stable patients and safely discontinue their overnight vital sign checks. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial, with inpatient encounters randomized 1:1 to intervention vs usual care, was conducted from March 11 to November 24, 2019. Participants included physicians serving on the primary team of 1699 patients on the general medical service (not in the intensive care unit) of a tertiary care academic medical center. INTERVENTIONS: A clinical decision support notification informed the physician if the patient had a high likelihood of nighttime vital signs within the reference ranges based on a logistic regression model that used real-time patient data as input. The notification provided the physician an opportunity to discontinue measure of nighttime vital signs, dismiss the notification for 1 hour, or dismiss the notification for that day. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was delirium, as determined by bedside nurse assessment of Nursing Delirium Screening Scale scores, a standardized delirium screening tool (delirium diagnosed with score ≥2). Secondary outcomes included mean nighttime vital sign checks. Potential harms included intensive care unit transfers and code blue alarms. All analyses were conducted on the basis of intention-to-treat. RESULTS: A total of 1930 inpatient encounters in 1699 patients (intervention encounters: 566 of 966 [59%] men; mean [SD] age, 53 [15] years) were randomized. In the intervention vs control arm, there was a significant decrease in the mean (SD) number of nighttime vital sign checks (0.97 [0.95] vs 1.41 [0.86]; P < .001) with no increase in intensive care unit transfers (49 [5%] vs 47 [5%]; P = .92) or code blue alarms (2 [0.2%] vs 9 [0.9%]; P = .07). The incidence of delirium was not significantly reduced (108 [11%] vs 123 [13%]; P = .32). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While this randomized clinical trial found no difference between groups in the primary outcome, delirium incidence, the secondary findings indicate that a real-time prediction algorithm embedded within a clinical decision support tool in the electronic health record can help physicians identify clinically stable patients who can forgo routine vital sign checks, safely giving them greater opportunity to sleep. Other aspects of hospital care that depend on clinical stability, such as level of care or cardiac monitoring, may be amenable to a similar intervention.

322,"Christiana Care Health System implemented a Care Management Guideline for Alcohol Withdrawal Symptom Management, which provided direction for inpatient screening for alcohol withdrawal risk, assessment, and treatment. Nurses educated on its use expressed confusion with the use of the assessment tools, pharmacokinetics, and pathophysiology of alcohol withdrawal and delirium tremens. Reeducation was provided by nursing professional development specialists. Pre- and postsurveys revealed that nurses were more confident in caring for patients with alcohol withdrawal.",0
323,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a commonly observed problem for adult patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) that is associated with increased mortality, increased hospital length of stay, and long-term disability of ICU survivors. This makes prevention and prompt treatment of delirium imperative goals for critical-care providers. Bedside critical-care nurses are uniquely poised to champion efforts to prevent, detect, and treat delirium but oftentimes are not aware of the most recent evidence-based guidelines or the potential long-term implications for the ICU survivor. Nurses have reported higher levels of confidence in detecting delirium, increased knowledge of delirium, and enhancement of patient care skills after receiving formal didactic educational training. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this quality improvement project were to develop, implement, and evaluate a nursing education program for critical-care nurses that presented a protocol for the prevention and management of delirium in adult ICU patient populations, as well as improve nurses' familiarity, comfort, and compliance with using a standardized evaluation method for delirium and intervention care bundle. DESIGN: A didactic training program for bedside critical-care nurses was developed and implemented. Upon completion of the educational sessions, a daily bedside delirium screening and care bundle protocol were implemented for all patients in ICUs throughout the facility. PARTICIPANTS: Bedside critical-care nurses were invited to participate in the formal teaching sessions. This included nursing staff from each of the 3 ICUs in this facility, as well as supplemental ""float pool"" staff. MEASUREMENTS: Pre-educational and posteducational nursing attitudes and self-perceived confidence levels regarding delirium care were measured using a 5-point Likert scale. Pre-educational and posteducational nursing knowledge was measured using raw scores obtained from a 15-item multiple choice test. Following the implementation of the delirium screening and care bundle protocol, nursing staff compliance with screening and care bundle items was measured, as well as overall incidence of positive delirium screenings among all screenings completed. RESULTS: A sample of 49 nurses participated in the formal educational teaching sessions. All 5 nursing attitude and perceived confidence statements measured before and after the educational sessions showed a significant increase in positive perceptions overall (P < .0001). Overall mean posteducation knowledge test raw scores showed a significant improvement from pre-educational scores (70% ± 12.8% vs 95% ± 6.9%; P < .0001). Once-daily ICU delirium screenings and care bundle interventions were initiated for all ICU patients; overall compliance during the measurement period was 56.3% (598 of 1061 possible delirium screenings and protocols completed). Of all daily patient screenings performed, 20.4% resulted positive for ICU delirium. All patients who received the care bundle interventions received the interventions uniformly, regardless of clinical delirium status. CONCLUSION: This quality improvement project demonstrates that a formal didactic training program for ICU nurses can result in increased awareness and knowledge of ICU delirium and adequately prepare them for how to properly screen and treat patients. Although overall compliance with implementing daily ICU delirium screenings and care bundle interventions was relatively low, those patients who did receive screening and interventions demonstrated that the incidence of positive delirium screenings at this facility is low compared with reported figures. In addition, patients who did receive the appropriate care bundle interventions did so in a uniform manner, regardless of the presence or absence of clinical delirium.",0
324,"The evaluation and treatment model expressed in the NCCN Distress Management Guidelines recommends that each new patient be rapidly assessed in the office or clinic waiting room for evidence of distress using a brief screening tool (the Distress Thermometer and Problem List) presented in Figure 1 (see page 369). A score of 5 or greater on the thermometer should trigger further evaluation and referral to a psychosocial service. The choice of which service should be determined by the problem areas specified on the Problem List. Patients with practical and psychosocial problems are referred to social work, emotional or psychological (excessive sadness, worry, nervousness) problems to mental health, and spiritual concerns to pastoral counselors. The primary oncology team members--doctor, nurse, and social worker--are central to making this model work. Team members collect information from the brief screening and problem list and expand it with the clinical evaluation. It is critical for at least one team member to be familiar with the mental health, psychosocial, and pastoral counseling resources available in the institution and the community. A list of the names and phone numbers for these resources should be kept in all oncology clinics and updated frequently. The first step in implementing this model is to establish a multidisciplinary committee in each institution or office responsible for 1) revising and modifying the standards of care to fit the particular clinical care setting and 2) implementing and monitoring the use of these standards. Because each institution has its own culture, standards must be implemented in ways that are compatible with each institution. The second step is to institute professional educational programs to ensure that staff is 1) aware that distress is under-recognized, 2) knowledgeable about the management of distress, and 3) aware of the resources available to treat it. It is important to have access to mental health professionals and clergy who are trained to deal with cancer-related distress. The benefits of treating distress in cancer accrue to the patients and their families, to the treating staff, and to improved efficiencies in clinic operations. Health care contracts often allow these services to ""fall through the cracks"" by failing to reimburse for them through either behavioral health or medical insurance. Reimbursement for services to treat psychosocial distress must be included in medical health care contracts to prevent fragmentation of services for the medically ill. For patients with cancer, integration, not separation, of mental health services and medical services is critically important. Also outcomes research studies that include quality-of-life assessment and analysis of cost-effectiveness are needed. Patients and families should be informed that management of distress is part of their total medical care. Finally, the multidisciplinary committee, office practice, or institution must be responsible for evaluating the quality of the distress management (see guidelines algorithm [page 368]), with CQI studies making an important contribution. Presently, the quality of the psychological care patients receive is not routinely monitored. Accrediting bodies have not directly examined the quality of psychosocial care, nor have they established minimal performance standards for its delivery. The panel believes that psychosocial care should and will eventually be on our institution's report cards.",0
325,"BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances are common in critically ill patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) with possible serious consequences. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to get insight into sleeping and sedation practices in the adult ICUs in the Netherlands and survey which factors are important with respect to sleep in critically ill patients in the ICU. METHOD: A multi-centre, exploratory survey sent via mail to nurse managers of all adult ICUs in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Interventions without medication to improve the sleep of the critically ill patients were mostly defined as keeping patients awake during the day (94.2%), reducing noise of the ICU staff (89.7%) and reducing nursing interventions at night (86.8%). None of the ICUs used a sleep questionnaire. Nursing autonomy regarding sleep and sedation practices for patients (rated on a 10-point numerical scale) was judged as moderate (median 5, interquartile range (IQR) 3-7). How often nursing observations influence sleeping practices in the ICU was judged as good (median 8, IQR 7-8). How the average ICU patient was sleeping was judged as moderately well (median 6, IQR 5-7). Most intensive care units (83.8%) did not have a sleeping protocol, but 67.6% of these intensive care units suggested they should implement a sleeping protocol. CONCLUSIONS: The average critically ill patient has sleep disturbances, that is, is sleeping moderately well according to nurses' views and opinions, mostly due to a disturbed sleep-awake cycle, delirium and nursing interventions. Intensive care nurses perceive only a moderate feeling of autonomy and influence regarding the management of sleeping practices.",0
326,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This paper uses the findings of two studies to explore the nature of nurses practice when working with vulnerable and marginalised populations, particularly with regard to the attributes of holism and individualised care. A secondary analysis of the findings of two separate studies was undertaken, one on the elderly with delirium and the other with indigenous Maori women. BACKGROUND: Often considered vulnerable and marginalised, elderly and indigenous experiences of health services are often fraught with their health needs not always identified or addressed. Nursing claims that holism and individualised care are pivotal attributes underpinning nursing practice. However, the secondary analysis of two research studies highlight how vulnerable and marginalised populations accessing health and nursing services experience needs that are neither acknowledged nor integrated into intervention and treatment plans. DESIGN: A secondary analysis of one study with the elderly with delirium used a critical gerontological methodology informed by postmodernism and Foucaults understanding of discourse. The other study with indigenous Maori women utilised Glaserian grounded theory informed by a Maori-centred methodology. METHODS: The research on the elderly with delirium analysed 20 data sources, including interviews with older persons who had experienced delirium, members of their families and health professionals. The research with 38 indigenous Maori women aged between 24 and 65 years, inductively analysed interview data using constant comparative analysis, theoretical sampling and saturation of the core categories to generate a substantive grounded theory. RESULTS: The findings of each study showed that a problem focussed approach to health care is offered to patients that does not incorporate individual health experiences. In addition, the social context integral to peoples lives outside of the health care environment is ignored and as such the very foundations of nursing practice, that of holism, is merely a rhetorical construct. CONCLUSIONS: Vulnerable and marginalised patients experience care that neglects their perceived health needs and the realities of their life circumstances. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Individualised care that extends beyond the presenting issue is vital, but raises challenges when working with those population groups considered vulnerable and marginalised to improve outcomes of their health experience.",0
327,"BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) often experience pain, oversedation, prolonged mechanical ventilation, delirium, and weakness. These conditions are important in that they often lead to protracted physical, neurocognitive, and mental health sequelae now termed postintensive care syndrome. Changing current ICU practice will not only require the adoption of evidence-based interventions but the development of effective and reliable teams to support these new practices. OBJECTIVES: To build on the success of bundled care and bridge an ongoing evidence-practice gap, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) recently launched the ICU Liberation ABCDEF Bundle Improvement Collaborative. The Collaborative aimed to foster the bedside application of the SCCM's Pain, Agitation, and Delirium Guidelines via the ABCDEF bundle. The purpose of this paper is to describe the history of the Collaborative, the evidence-based implementation strategies used to foster change and teamwork, and the performance and outcome metrics used to monitor progress. METHODS: Collaborative participants were required to attend four in-person meetings, monthly colearning calls, database training sessions, an e-Community listserv, and select in-person site visits. Teams submitted patient-level data and completed pre- and postimplementation questionnaires focused on the assessment of teamwork and collaboration, work environment, and overall ICU care. Faculty shared the evidence used to derive each bundle element as well as team-based implementation strategies for improvement and sustainment. RESULTS: Retention in the Collaborative was high, with 67 of 69 adult and eight of nine pediatric ICUs fully completing the program. Baseline and prospective data were collected on over 17,000 critically ill patients. A variety of evidence-based professional behavioral change interventions and novel implementation techniques were utilized and shared among Collaborative members. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Hospitals and health systems can use the Collaborative structure, strategies, and tools described in this paper to help successfully implement the ABCDEF bundle in their ICUs.",0
328,"BACKGROUND: High noise levels in intensive care units are common. Increased noise levels can lead to sleep deprivation, increased pain perception, and delirium. The most common cause of reducible noise in intensive care units often is attributed to staff conversations. OBJECTIVES: In January 2015, the neurosurgical intensive care unit staff identified noise as a problem, referencing complaints from other disciplines and family members. Quiet times from 3 am to 5 am and from 3 pm to 5 pm were agreed upon. An improvement plan was developed with a goal to decrease noise levels by 10 decibels in 6 months. METHODS: Using a decibel meter, noise data were collected in 4 locations every 30 minutes during the chosen times for 8 days. Quiet time was implemented 1 week after staff, patient, and family education was completed. Decibel data were collected and evaluated after 60 days. RESULTS: There were statistically significant reductions in noise levels at nurses' station left (P = .04) and the bed 9 entrance (P = .02). Noise levels were lower, but not significantly so, for nurses' station right (P = .12) and the bed 4 entrance (P = .06). Noise levels during quiet time decreased to an average of 10 to 15 decibels lower than baseline data. CONCLUSIONS: Sharing baseline data was effective to heighten noise awareness. During quiet time, limiting conversations, eliminating environmental noise, and dimming the lights as a reminder to be quiet are 3 simple strategies that can be implemented to lessen noise.",0
329,"BACKGROUND AND RELEVANCE: Early recognition of delirium mobilizes nurses to intervene in a timely manner to minimize cognitive, physical, and mental health burdens. The life-altering challenges of unrecognized delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients motivated a group of Massachusetts ICU nurse leaders to form a collaborative and improve delirium screening accuracy in 4 area hospitals. LOCAL PROBLEM: Baseline audits confirmed a lack of delirium screening accuracy across multiple institutions. The purpose of this article is to describe how our collaborative was developed and to outline our delirium accuracy assessment program. METHODS: In March of 2015, 2 graduates from the Clinical Scene Investigator Academy contacted members within the Boston cohort to form a regional collaborative to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of our project was to improve our delirium assessment accuracy to greater than 80% in patients across our ICUs. Using a successful project, we scaled this work based on the needs of each institution. A preaudit-postaudit design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of our programs. RESULTS: Data showed an improved overall accuracy assessment of 88.3% (P < .01), whereas the patients with an altered Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale markedly improved to 87.7% (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Every ICU in the United States is working on improving reportable quality metrics, but all too often, this work is being done in silos. When critical care nurses have the knowledge, skills, and time to work together, they can begin to transform health care.",0
330,"PURPOSE: To characterize physicians' stated practices in the treatment of patients with severe acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome (sAAWS) and to use intravenous (IV) phenobarbital as an adjuvant treatment for sAAWS. METHODS: A multidisciplinary, cross-sectional, self-administered survey at 2 large academic centers specializing in inner-city healthcare. RESULTS: We analyzed 105 of 195 questionnaires (53.8% response rate). On average, clinicians managed 32 cases of AAWS over a 6-month period, of which 7 (21.9%) were severe. Haloperidol (Haldol; 40 [39%]), clonidine (Catapres; 31 [30%]), phenobarbital (Luminal, Tedral; 29 [27%]) and propofol (Diprivan; 29 [28%]) were the most commonly used adjuvant medications for sAAWS. Sixty-three (60%) of respondents did not use phenobarbital in practice. Of phenobarbital users, 23 (55%) respondents used it early in patients who were refractory to symptom-triggered benzodiazepine treatment. Others waited until patients experienced seizures (5 [10%]) or required intensive care unit admission (8 [18%]). Respondents who used phenobarbital preferred to use the IV versus oral form (66% vs 29%, P < .001). Most respondents, however, were unfamiliar with the pharmacokinetics, side effects, contraindications, and evidence supporting phenobarbital use for sAAWS. Although many respondents (64 [61%]) expressed discomfort using phenobarbital, 87 (83%) expressed comfort or neutrality with enrolling patients in a trial to evaluate IV phenobarbital in sAAWS. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable stated practice variation exists in how clinicians treat patients with sAAWS. Our findings support conduct of a pilot trial to evaluate IV phenobarbital as an adjuvant treatment to symptom-triggered benzodiazepines for sAAWS and have informed trial design.",0
331,"It has become a standard measure in recent years to utilise evidence-based practice, which is associated with a greater need to implement and use advanced, reliable methods of summarising the achievements of various scientific disciplines, including such highly specialised approaches as personalised medicine. The aim of this paper was to discuss the current state of knowledge related to improvements in ""nursing"" involving management of delirium in intensive care units during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This narrative review summarises the current knowledge concerning the challenges associated with assessment of delirium in patients with COVID-19 by ICU nurses, and the role and tasks in the personalised approach to patients with COVID-19.",0
332,"Intensive care unit (ICU) patients experience highly complex health problems, such as pain, agitation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption (PADIS), and require professional nursing care. The assessment of PADIS is critically important for ICU nurses, and therefore, PADIS education programs need to be conducted for these nurses to update and improve their caring knowledge, attitudes, and skills. The aims of this study are to bridge this gap by evaluating the effects of PADIS education programs on the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of these nurses, and compare the difference between novice and advanced nurses after receiving the PADIS education programs over a short period of time. In this quasi-experimental study, 112 nurses in ICUs were recruited by researchers and participated in the PADIS education programs. The PADIS education intervention was performed in a teaching hospital in Taipei. A demographic and self-developed PADIS care knowledge questionnaire was used. A baseline (T1) was measured before the interventions, followed by post-test (T2) immediately after the programs, and subsequently a follow-up (T3) test one month later. The results indicated that knowledge and skill scores between novice and advanced nurses varied significantly in T1 but not in T2 and T3. Thus, education programs can significantly assist novice ICU nurses to improve their short-term knowledge, attitudes, and skills, and PADIS education programs are strongly suggested for clinical nursing practice.",0
333,"BACKGROUND: The administration of sedatives in terminally ill patients becomes an increasingly feasible medical option in end-of-life care. However, sedation for intractable distress has raised considerable medical and ethical concerns. In our study we provide a critical analysis of seven years experience with the application of sedation in the final phase of life in our palliative care unit. METHODS: Medical records of 548 patients, who died in the Palliative Care Unit of GK Havelhoehe between 1995-2002, were retrospectively analysed with regard to sedation in the last 48 hrs of life. The parameters of investigation included indication, choice and kind of sedation, prevalence of intolerable symptoms, patients' requests for sedation, state of consciousness and communication abilities during sedation. Critical evaluation included a comparison of the period between 1995-1999 and 2000-2002. RESULTS: 14.6% (n = 80) of the patients in palliative care had sedation given by the intravenous route in the last 48 hrs of their life according to internal guidelines. The annual frequency to apply sedation increased continuously from 7% in 1995 to 19% in 2002. Main indications shifted from refractory control of physical symptoms (dyspnoea, gastrointestinal, pain, bleeding and agitated delirium) to more psychological distress (panic-stricken fear, severe depression, refractory insomnia and other forms of affective decompensation). Patients' and relatives' requests for sedation in the final phase were significantly more frequent during the period 2000-2002. CONCLUSION: Sedation in the terminal or final phase of life plays an increasing role in the management of intractable physical and psychological distress. Ethical concerns are raised by patients' requests and needs on the one hand, and the physicians' self-understanding on the other hand. Hence, ethically acceptable criteria and guidelines for the decision making are needed with special regard to the nature of refractory and intolerable symptoms, patients' informed consent and personal needs, the goals and aims of medical sedation in end-of-life care.",0
334,"AIMS & OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the decision-making processes undertaken by critical care nurses when considering restraint to manage a patient with psychomotor agitation secondary to hyperactive delirium. BACKGROUND: Psychomotor agitation is frequently cited as clinical rationale for initiating chemical or physical restraint. Despite the presence of clinical guidance for restraint in critical care, wide variations in nursing and prescribing practice are evident. Nurses are the primary decision makers when initiating restraint, but little is known about this process and influencing factors. DESIGN: A pragmatic qualitative approach was used to explore critical care nurses' decision-making processes. METHODS: A 'think aloud' approach was undertaken. Audio-visual vignettes featuring simulated patients were used as stimulus to elicit decision-making processes from thirty critical care nurses and practitioners. The COREQ checklist was followed. RESULTS: Five themes relating to restraint were identified: Intrinsic beliefs and aptitudes; Handover and labelling; Failure to maintain a consistent approach; Restraint might be used to replace vigilance; The tyranny of the now. CONCLUSIONS: Restraint was more frequent when staffing ratios were reduced below 1:1 and opportunities for vigilance reduced. Participants described physical and psychological exhaustion when caring for a patient with delirium and how this might lead to restraint to create 'space' for respite. Variations in practice were evident and restraint use appears rooted in custom and culture rather than objective assessment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The lack of pre-emptive management for hyperactive delirium and reduced staffing ratios lead to the decision to restrain to preserve safety in acute agitation. The struggle to manage agitated behaviour is associated with nurse burnout and reduced engagement with therapeutic management methods, suggesting the need for psychological and educational support for clinical staff. Delirium is an important and debilitating form of organ dysfunction which should be collaboratively managed by the multi-disciplinary team.",0
335,"Delirium, a syndrome that results in high morbidity and mortality rates in the elderly, continues to be underrecognized by physicians and nurses. Factors influencing the underrecognition of delirium are specific to individual institutions and their health care providers. The factors leading to the underrecognition of delirium must be identified so that changes can be made to increase early recognition. A case study conducted in a critical care unit in a midwestern hospital from interviews of nurses, chart audit, and patient observation, identified two major problems associated with the lack of recognition of delirium in that institution: (1) lack of knowledge on the part of nurses about the criteria and methods of detecting delirium, and (2) ineffective communication between all staff members in relaying symptoms of onset of the disorder. As a result of this study, staff education, assessment protocols, and improved communication and documentation techniques are indicated as targeted methods for improving recognition and treatment of delirium in this setting. Similar case studies can be performed to evaluate institutional practice, and thereby identify barriers to early recognition of delirium.",0
336,"BACKGROUND: Many critical illness survivors experience new or worsening mental health impairments. Psychiatry consultation services can provide a critical role in identifying, addressing, and preventing mental health challenges during and after admission to the acute medical care setting. However, psychiatry involvement in the ICU setting is lower than in other hospital settings and the conventional process in many hospitals requires other care providers to request consultation by psychiatry. Despite these differences, no studies have sought ICU provider perspectives on psychiatry consultation's current and desired role. We aimed to obtain stakeholder feedback on psychiatry's current and desired roles in the ICU, and potential benefits and drawbacks of increasing psychiatry's presence. METHODS: A web-based survey obtained perspectives from 373 critical care physicians and advance practice providers, bedside nurses, physical and occupational therapists, pharmacists, and consultation-liaison psychiatry physicians and advance practice providers at a tertiary care center using multiple choice and open-ended questions. Descriptive information and content analysis of qualitative data provided information on stakeholder perspectives. RESULTS: Psychiatry's primary current role was seen as assistance with management of mental health issues (38%) and suicide risk assessments (23%). 46% wished for psychiatry's increased involvement in the ICU. Perceived benefits of increased psychiatry presence in the ICU included early psychological support in parallel with medical care, identification of psychiatric factors impacting treatment, and facilitation of family understanding of the patient's mental state/delirium. An additional perceived benefit included reduction in provider burnout through processing difficult situations and decreasing family psychological distress. However, one concern included potential conflict among providers regarding treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Those who work closely with the critically ill patients think that increased psychological support in the ICU would be beneficial. By contrast, psychiatry's current involvement is seen to be limited, perhaps driven by varying perceptions of what psychiatry's role is or should be.",0
337,"The new anaesthetic conserving device (ACD) allows the use of isoflurane and sevoflurane without classical anaesthesia workstations. Volatile anaesthetic exhaled by the patient is absorbed by a reflector and released to the patient during the next inspiration. Liquid anaesthetic is delivered via a syringe pump. Currently the use of the ACD is spreading among European intensive care units (ICU). This article focuses on the functioning of the device and on particularities which are important to consider. The ACD constantly reflects 90% of the exhaled anaesthetic back to the patient, but if one exhaled breath contains more than 10 ml of anaesthetic vapour (e.g. >1 vol% in 1,000 ml), the capacity of the reflector will be exceeded and relatively more anaesthetic will be lost to the patient. This spill over decreases efficiency but it also contributes to safety as very high concentrations are averted. Compared to classical anaesthesia systems the ACD used in conjunction with ICU ventilators offers advantages in the ICU setting: investment costs are low, carbon dioxide absorbent is not needed, breathing comfort is higher, anaesthetic consumption is low (equal to an anaesthesia circuit with a fresh gas flow of approximately 1 l/min) and anaesthetic concentrations can be controlled very quickly (increased by small boluses and decreased by removal of the ACD). On the other hand, case costs are higher (single patient use) and a dead space of 100 ml is added. There are pitfalls: by a process called auto-pumping, expansion of bubbles inside the syringe may lead to uncontrolled anaesthetic delivery. Auto-pumping is provoked by high positioning of the syringe pump, heat and prior cooling of the liquid anaesthetic. Inherent to the device is an early inspiratory concentration peak and an end-inspiratory dip which may mislead commonly used gas monitors. Workplace concentrations can be minimized by proper handling, a sufficient turnover of room air is important and gas from the expiration port of the ventilator should be scavenged. Inhalational compared to intravenous ICU sedation offers the advantages of better control of the sedation level, online drug monitoring, no accumulation in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency and bronchodilation. With a lowered opioid dose spontaneous breathing and intestinal motility are well preserved. A clinical algorithm for the care of patients with respiratory insufficiency including inhalational sedation is proposed. Inhalational sedation with isoflurane has been widely used for more than 20 years in many countries and even for periods of up to several weeks. In the German S3 guidelines for the management of analgesia, sedation and delirium in intensive care (Martin et al. 2010), inhalational sedation is mentioned as an alternative sedation method for patients ventilated via an endotracheal tube or a tracheal cannula. Nevertheless, isoflurane is not officially licensed for ICU sedation and its use is under the responsibility of the prescribing physician.",0
338,"The diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders in intensive care patients have been for a long time neglected. They are nowadays better recognized and managed. These disorders are mainly: delirium; anxiety disorders, from simple anxiety to panic disorder with agitation; adaptation disorders with depressive mood; brief psychotic disorders with persecution ideas. The manifestations of psychiatric disorders occur not only during the stay in intensive care unit (ICU) but also after transfer from ICU and several months after discharge from hospital. Part of psychiatric disorders is caused by organic or toxic causes (metabolic disturbances, electrolyte imbalance, withdrawal syndromes, infection, vascular disorders and head trauma). Nevertheless some authors estimate that they are due to the particular environment of ICU. The particularities of these units are: a high sound level (noise level average between 50 and 60 dBA), the absence of normal day-night cycle, a sleep deprivation, a sensory deprivation, the inability for intubated patients to talk, the pain provoked by some medical procedures, the possibility to witness other patients' death. Although most patients feel secure in ICU, some of them perceive ICU's environment as threatening. Simple environmental modifications could prevent the apparition of some psychiatric manifestations: efforts should be made to decrease noise generated by equipment and staff conversations, to provide external windows, visible clocks and calendar, to ensure adequate sleep with normal day-night cycle and to encourage more human contact. Psychotropic drugs are useful but a warm and empathetic attitude can be very helpful. Some authors described specific psychotherapeutic interventions in ICU (hypnosis, coping strategies.). To face anxiety, many patients have defense attitudes as psychological regression and denial. Patient's family is suffering too. Relative's hospitalization causes a crisis in family. Unpredicted illnesses often force family members to reorganize in order to regain their equilibrium. Every family should be proposed a psychological support. Caregivers can be distressed as well. This stress is due to their high responsibility and the fact that they face disease and death. Simple measures can lessen stress'effect and prevent the  burn-out syndrome . In conclusion, the importance of a liaison psychiatrist-intensive care physician collaboration must be emphasized in order that patients and their family have a better psychological support. Psychological management should be proposed during the hospitalization and after discharge from hospital.",0
339,"AIM: The aim of this study was the translation, cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Family Confusion Assessment Method in critically ill patients. BACKGROUND: Delirium is a frequently unrecognized disorder in critically ill patients. Visiting family members might be the first to notice subtle changes in a patient's cognition and behaviour. The Family Confusion Assessment Method was developed to detect delirium by family members, but has not been available for the German-speaking area yet. DESIGN: A prospective validation study was conducted between January 2020 and October 2020. METHODS: The Family Confusion Assessment Method was translated into German according to the Principles of Good Practice for the Translation and Cultural Adaptation Process for Patient-Reported Outcomes. Subsequently, we compared the Family Confusion Assessment Method with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit in critically ill patients and their family members in a medical intensive care unit in Germany. RESULTS: We included 50 dyads of critically ill patients and their family members. The prevalence of delirium measured by Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit was 44%. Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.84. The German Family Confusion Assessment Method had a high sensitivity of 95.5% and specificity of 89.3%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 87.5% and 96.2% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the German Family Confusion Assessment Method is an accurate assessment tool for delirium detection in the intensive care unit by family members. Furthermore, the results indicate that family members may identify delirium by the Family Confusion Assessment Method without prior training. IMPACT: Collaborating medical staff with patients' family members to detect delirium in the intensive care unit may lead to early recognition of delirium.",0
340,"Patients admitted to the intensive care unit often experience some degree of pain and frequently are anxious, confused or delirious. Relief of pain, anxiety and agitation is important for effective patient care. Initial attention should be directed toward eliminating organic causes of delirium. Opioids are the cornerstone of analgesia, while benzodiazepines and haloperidol are commonly used for sedation and relief of agitation. When sedative agents fail to control agitation and effective ventilation of the patient is compromised, it may be appropriate to pharmacologically paralyze the patient.",0
341,"BACKGROUND: Delirium in patients in the intensive care unit is associated with adverse outcomes. Nurses experience many difficulties in caring for those with delirium, which can lead to nurse burnout, prevent effective care for patients, and negatively impact the patient. The identification of factors creating challenges for nurses is, therefore, important to enable intervention. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop a new scale to assess the difficulties faced by nurses caring for patients with delirium in the intensive care unit and to examine its reliability and validity. METHODS: We based our draft scale items on literature reviews and interviews. Four experts evaluated the collected items. After a pilot study, 211 nurses working in intensive care units in Japan completed the questionnaire. Subsequent statistical analysis of results included factor validity, construct validity, known-group validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis extracted a scale of 33 items with eight factors and an additional scale of four items with one factor. The analysis of construct validity suggested a possible association with the Strain of Care for Delirium Index. In the known-group validity, a comparison with two groups based on experience in the intensive care unit found significant differences among the five factors. Internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.68-.87) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients = .46-.62) were confirmed. CONCLUSION: We developed a difficulty scale for nurses caring for patients with delirium in the intensive care unit and confirmed its reliability and validity. The difficulty factors were developed with the intention to identify educational interventions for nurses and the introduction of new organisational resources, such as manpower and providing emotional support and feedback to nurses.",0
342,"INTRODUCTION: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery may experience both short-term and long-term postoperative neurological problems. However, the underlying cause of this impairment is unclear. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) levels may play a role in the development of acute dysfunction, known as postoperative delirium, in addition to longer term outcomes after cardiac surgery. Yet the degree of impairment has been difficult to define, partly due to subjective methods of assessments. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by determining the relationship between rSO2, postoperative delirium and long-term neurological outcome after cardiac surgery using quantitative robotic technology. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 95 patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery will be recruited for this single-centre prospective observational study. Patients will be assessed before as well as 3 and 12 months after their surgery using the Kinarm End-Point Lab and standardised tasks. Intraoperatively, rSO2 and other haemodynamic data will be collected for the duration of the procedure. Following their operation, patients will also be screened daily for delirium during their hospital stay. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board at Queen's University (DMED-1672-14). The results of this study will be published in a peer-review journal and presented at international and/or national conferences as poster or oral presentations. Participants wishing to know the results of this study will be contacted directly on data publication. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04081649.",0
343,"OBJECTIVE: In this survey, we assessed the current clinical management of postoperative delirium (POD) among Chinese anesthesiologists, after publishing the European POD guideline. METHODS: We administered an electronic survey, designed according to the European POD guideline. The survey was completed using mobile devices. RESULTS: In total, 1,514 respondents from China participated in the survey. Overall, 74.4% of participants reported that delirium is very important. More than 95% of participants stated that they routinely assessed POD. In total, 61.4% screened for POD using clinical observation and 37.6% used a delirium screening tool. Although the depth of anesthesia (a POD risk factor) was monitored, electroencephalogram monitoring was unavailable to 30.6% of respondents. Regarding treatment, only 24.1% of respondents used a standard algorithm; 58.5% used individualized treatment. CONCLUSION: Our survey showed that there are high awareness levels among Chinese anesthesiologists regarding the importance of POD. However, routine assessment and monitoring of all patients, including perioperative anesthesia depth monitoring, and a treatment algorithm need to be implemented on a larger scale. According to the results, efforts should be made to improve the knowledge of POD among Chinese anesthesiologists.",0
344,"BACKGROUND: Improving the self-efficacy of intensive care unit nurses for delirium care could help them adapt to the changing situation of delirium patients. Validated measures of nurses' self-efficacy of delirium care are lacking OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to develop a Delirium Care Self-Efficacy Scale for assessing nurses' confidence about caring for patients in the intensive care unit and to examine the scale's psychometric properties. METHODS: Draft scale items were generated from a review of relevant literature and face-to-face interviews with intensive care unit nurses; content validity was conducted with a panel of five experts in delirium. A group of nurses were recruited by convenience sampling from intensive care units (N = 299) for item analysis of the questionnaire, assessment of validity, and reliability of the scale. Nurse participants were recruited from nine adult critical care units affiliated with a hospital in Taiwan. Data were collected from August 2020 to July 2021. RESULTS: Content validity index was 0.98 for the initial 26 items, indicating good validity. The critical ratio for item discrimination was 14.47-19.29, and item-to-total correlations ranged from 0.67 to 0.81. Principal component analysis reduced items to 13 and extracted two factors, confidence in delirium assessment and confidence in delirium management, which explained 66.82% of the total variance. Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency was 0.94 with good test-retest reliability (r = 0.92). High scale scores among participants were significantly associated with age (≥40 years), work experience in an intensive care unit (≥10 years), delirium education, and willingness to use delirium assessment tools. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed Delirium Care Self-Efficacy Scale demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity as a measure of confidence for intensive care nurses caring for and managing patients with delirium in the intensive care unit.",0
345,"BACKGROUND: Team-based approaches involving the cooperation of various professionals have the power to improve the quality of medical care by utilizing the specialized knowledge and skills of each professional. A multidisciplinary pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD) management team was established in Hiroshima University Hospital. Herein, we describe smooth patient mobilization achieved by enabling discussions among members of this multidisciplinary management team. CASE: The patient was a 72-year-old Japanese woman with acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia and respiratory failure. We identified a suspected alveolar hemorrhage by bronchofiberscopy on the patient's first day in the intensive care unit (ICU). This finding required the patient to be placed on bed rest. Therefore, her physiotherapy program was restricted to mobilization. In team rounds during the patient's 5th day in the ICU, we discussed her mobilization. Discussions among the multidisciplinary medical staff led to mobilization and a reduction in sedation medication administered because of the suspected alveolar hemorrhage. The patient underwent a second bronchofiberscopy by emergency medical doctors to assess the alveolar hemorrhage immediately after PAD rounds. The suspected alveolar hemorrhage was not confirmed. Therefore, the physiotherapy program was amended to include standing exercises and sitting in a wheelchair; the new program was initiated the same day. The patient did not experience worsening symptoms during her hospitalization and was discharged from the hospital 95 days after initial admission. CONCLUSIONS: By discussing treatment options within a multidisciplinary medical team, we achieved smooth patient mobilization and administered reduced levels of sedation medication.",0
346,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, the Federal government's agenda to increase clinical training places to address the forecast shortfall of nurses is driving innovation in clinical education. A student leadership model of clinical education, named the Student Nurse Led Ward model, was designed for the aged care context to provide a high number of clinical placements for pre-service Bachelor of Nursing students in an under-utilized clinical education setting. OBJECTIVES: The research aimed to determine the viability of the innovation by (1) developing a preliminary understanding of what students were learning and (2) exploring stakeholders' perceptions about student learning. DESIGN: A mixed methods design included an ageing knowledge test and ageing attitudes survey, both administered before and after the placement, student narratives of a learning event written after the placement, as well as focus group and individual interviews with stakeholders. SETTING: Three residential aged care facilities partnering with one university in one Australian jurisdiction. PARTICIPANTS: Included 35 of the 45 students who began placement in the aged care facilities during one semester, a convenience sample of 15 staff and each of the managers and educators from the three agencies. METHODS: Descriptive statistical analysis of student pre-post knowledge test and attitude survey, hermeneutic analysis of student narratives, and content analysis of individual and group interview data. RESULTS: There was an increase in student knowledge around sensory changes, delirium, and drug reactions in older people. There was a slight increase in students' expression of ageist attitudes following the clinical experience. The clinical educator position was considered to be critical to the success of the model. CONCLUSIONS: This Student Nurse Led Ward model is a viable model to increase clinical placements, with preliminary evidence in this study suggesting that students benefit through increased knowledge, understanding and capacity to work with older people.",0
347,"OBJECTIVE: Critically ill patients exhibit profound disturbances of circadian rhythmicity, most commonly in the form of a phase delay. We investigated the specific zeitgeber properties of a medical intensive care unit to develop a model that explained these abnormalities. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: Prospective, observational study conducted during 2013-2014. Twenty-four-hour ambient light (lux, 672 hours) and sound pressure levels (dBA, 504 hours) were measured in patient rooms. Patients and families were surveyed regarding their perceptions of the environment. SETTING: University-based adult medical intensive care unit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The timing and intensity of the ambient light-dark cycle and sound environment and the relationship of these measurements to patient/family perceptions. RESULTS: Twenty-four-hour light-dark cycles were extremely weak and phase delayed relative to the solar cycle. Morning light averaged 12.1 (4.8, 37.2) lux, when only 24.9% ± 10.9% of available light was utilised; yet patients and families did not identify low daytime light levels as problematic. Median noise levels were invariably excessive (nighttime 47.9 [45.0, 51.3] dBA) with minimal variation, consistent with the absence of a defined rest period. CONCLUSION: The intensive care unit functions as a near-constant routine protocol disconnected from solar time. Behavioural interventions to promote entrainment should be supported by objective measurements of light and sound.",0

349,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aims of the present study were investigating the feasibility of: (1) using the Danish version of Sophia Observation withdrawal Symptoms-Paediatric Delirium (SOS-PD) screening tool in clinical practice and (2) comparing SOS-PD performance to a child psychiatrist's assessment using the diagnostic criteria as a reference standard. BACKGROUND: Critically ill children risk developing delirium potentially causing discomfort and suffering. Intensive care delirium has a fluctuating course complicating detection. Systematic screening during and after intensive care is central to manage paediatric delirium. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a descriptive and comparative design. First aim: Bedside nurses were asked to evaluate their experience of using the SOS-PD. Second aim: We compared the SOS-PD performance with the child psychiatrist assessment in 50 children aged 4 weeks to 18 years. RESULTS: Nurses found the Danish version of the SOS-PD applicable and easy to use. Of the 50 children included, 13 were diagnosed with delirium by the child psychiatrist. Consistency was found between the SOS-PD score and the child psychiatrist's assessment (88%). We found three false-negative and three false-positive SOS-PD cases. The false-negative cases could be explained by the differences in time periods for the assessments. SOS-PD assessments covered the past 4 h, whereas the psychiatric assessments covered the past 24 h. We assume the false-positive cases represent an acceptable inconsistency between the two assessment methods. CONCLUSIONS: The Danish version of the SOS-PD appeared suitable for identifying paediatric delirium. Our results emphasised the importance of assessment at least once during each nursing shift to ensure delirium detection around the clock due to the fluctuating course of delirium. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Implementing the Danish SOS-PD may increase awareness of this critical disorder by improving systematic identification of paediatric delirium in clinical practice paving the way for improved delirium prevention and management.",0
350,"BACKGROUND: Although popular, clinical practice guidelines are not universally accepted by healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVES: To compare nurses' and physicians' actual and perceived rates of adherence to practice guidelines used in sedation of patients receiving mechanical ventilation and to describe nurses' and physicians' perceptions of guideline use. METHODS: Pairs of fellows and nurses caring for 60 eligible patients were asked separately about their rationale for medicating patients, effectiveness of medication, and their perceived adherence to the guidelines. Actual adherence was determined independently by review of medical records. An additional 18 nurses and 11 physicians were interviewed about perceptions of guideline use. RESULTS: Use of mechanical ventilation was the most common reason given by physicians (53%) and nurses (48%) for medicating patients, although reasons for administering medication to a given patient differed in up to 30% of cases. Physicians and nurses disagreed on the effectiveness of medication in 42% (P = .01) of cases. Physicians reported following guidelines in 69% of cases, but their actual adherence rate was only 20%. Clinicians sometimes had difficulty distinguishing among anxiety, pain, and delirium. Clinicians justified variations from guidelines by citing the value of individualized patient care. Nurses and physicians sometimes had different goals in the use of sedation. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians may think they are following sedation guidelines when they are not, and they may prescribe incorrect medications if the cause of agitation is misdiagnosed. Differences between physicians and nurses in values and perceptions may hamper implementation of clinical practice guidelines.",0
352,"BACKGROUND: Excessive alcohol consumption, a major health problem worldwide, affects about 6% of the United States population. Caring for patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a hospital ward presents complex physiologic and psycho-social challenges which are best met with evidence-based practices. An academic medical center in the United States has been experiencing an increase in patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, gaps in clinician knowledge and infrastructure supporting the management of these patients still existed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this project was to improve the continuity of care of patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal in a medical surgical high acuity transitional care unit by incorporating evidence-based practices, and thereby to positively impact on patient outcomes. Specific objectives were related to standardized assessments and pharmacologic management strategies. METHODS: The project used the Joanna Briggs Institute's Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System and Getting Research into Practice audit tool for promoting change in health practice. A baseline clinical audit was conducted to assess compliance with best practices for managing alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which was followed by several interventions targeted at nurses and providers. A follow-up audit was conducted to assess compliance with the implemented strategies. The follow-up audit used the same evidence-based audit criteria as those used for the baseline audit. A non-probabilistic, convenience sampling approach was used. A sample size of 15 patients was used for both the baseline and follow-up audits. RESULTS: The baseline audit revealed a high compliance rate for four of the five audit criteria concerning risk assessment and pharmacologic strategies. There was sub-optimal compliance (53%) with the criterion regarding use of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale (revised) (CIWA-Ar) scale to assess patients with alcohol withdrawal. After the interventions were implemented this criterion recorded an improvement to 100% compliance. None of the patients in the pilot were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for reasons relating to alcohol withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this project demonstrated alcohol withdrawal management can be safely undertaken outside the ICU when the patients are appropriately assessed and treated for the severity of their withdrawal symptoms. This new clinical program significantly impacted on continuity of care. Challenges were resolved using an interdisciplinary team approach. The project resulted in plans for further areas of work concerning alcohol withdrawal management, including adoption of similar approaches by other acute and transitional care units.",0
353,"The incidence of delirium in intensive care units is high and it has been under-diagnosed and under-treated. OBJECTIVE: To describe the experiences of ICU nurses in the identification and application of non-pharmacological treatments. METHOD: A qualitative phenomenological research study was performed, based on focus groups. INCLUSION CRITERIA: ICU nurses with one year of more of experience were included. Sample Purpose and snowball technique. DATA COLLECTION: Data from the focus groups were transcribed for analysis and a thematic analysis of the texts was performed. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: a) the physical and social structure of the ICU b) family involvement, c) need for training of health professionals, and d) encouraging the sleep-wake cycle. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to control the ICU environment to make it more friendly, to change the routine work to promote relaxation, implement training activities and to make visiting hours flexible.",0
354,"OBJECTIVE: During an outbreak of mass methanol poisonings in the Czech Republic in 2012-2013, fomepizole was applied as an alternative antidote to ethanol. We present the laboratory data, clinical features, adverse reactions, and treatment outcomes in all patients treated with fomepizole. METHODS: Combined retrospective and prospective case series study in 25 patients, median age 50 (16-73) years, 18 males and 7 females. RESULTS: There were 24% fatalities, 36% survivors without health impairment, and 40% survivors with sequelae. All the patients who died were comatose on admission; the mortality was 50% among patients in a coma. The median intensive care unit length of stay was six (2-22) days. The median total dose of fomepizole was 2 (1-9) g. Complications were observed in 7/25 cases: aspiration pneumonia (4), sepsis (2), bleeding (2), malignant arrhythmia (1), delirium tremens (1), and rebound of acidosis (1). The patients who survived without impairment were less acidotic than those who died or survived with sequelae (P<0.01). No difference in serum methanol and formate was found between the three groups. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence whether fomepizole is a more efficient antidote than ethanol with regards to the hospital mortality. The possibility of delirium tremens in the patients with a history of chronic alcohol abuse has to be taken in consideration. The benefits of fomepizole were indirect: no need to monitor serum ethanol's level during the hemodialysis in severely poisoned patients and less working overload on ICU doctors treating several poisoned patients simultaneously.",0
355,"WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Little is known about how PTSD and dementia in Veterans is identified by health care providers. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Healthcare providers identify those behavioural symptoms experienced by older people living with dementia that represent an unmet need associated with PTSD secondary to military service. Once healthcare providers recognize the presence of symptoms relevant to PTSD, they modify their care approach to include focused/tailored non-pharmacological care interventions that address environmental and situational variables that reflect military action. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Specialized education and training is needed to improve the identification of PTSD when existent with other co-occurring neurocognitive conditions such as delirium, dementia and depression. ABSTRACT: Introduction Co-occurring PTSD and dementia in Veterans can be difficult to distinguish from dementia-related responsive behaviours, which may result in inappropriate care management. Improved identification of PTSD and dementia is necessary to inform more appropriate and effective care for Veterans. Aim/Question The purpose of this study was to understand how Canadian healthcare providers have learned to identify the co-occurrence of PTSD symptoms in Veterans with dementia. Methods Eight semi-structured interviews employing the Critical Incident Technique were conducted with key informant healthcare providers who treat Veterans from across Canada. Framework analysis was used to code, sort and develop themes. Results Observed differences in Veterans with PTSD and dementia cued healthcare providers to seek our more information, leading to a new understanding of past trauma underlying the symptoms they observed. Healthcare providers then altered their usual care approaches to utilize trust-based and validation-oriented strategies resulting in more effective care management. Discussion Improvement in the identification of co-occurring PTSD and dementia in Veterans requires specialized education and training for healthcare providers. Implications for Practice Recognizing the complex needs of older Veterans with co-occurring PTSD and dementia is necessary for healthcare providers to implement more effective care for this population. Relevance Statement This paper provides mental health nurses with new understanding of co-occurring PTSD and dementia in Veterans. With an ageing Veteran population in Canada, mental health nurses need to be knowledgeable about the care for Veteran specific mental health needs.",0
356,"Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) often experience stress and anxiety. Although stress and anxiety can be pharmacologically attenuated, some drugs cause adverse side effects such as bradycardia, immobility, and delirium. There is thus a need for an alternative treatment with no substantial adverse effects. Music intervention is a potential alternative. In the present study, we used cortisol levels, subjective questionnaires, and physiological parameters to explore the anxiety-reducing effects of music intervention in a sample of ICU patients on mechanical ventilation. Patients admitted to the ICU for ≥ 24 hr were randomly assigned to the music intervention ( n = 41) or control group ( n = 44). Music group patients individually listened to music from 4:00 to 4:30 p.m.; control group patients wore headphones but heard no music for the same 30 min. Anxiety was measured using serum cortisol levels, the Chinese Version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure. After adjusting for demographics, analysis of covariance showed that the music group had significantly better scores for all posttest measures ( p < .02) and pre-post differences ( p < .03) except for diastolic blood pressure. Because of music intervention's low cost and easy administration, clinical nurses may want to use music to reduce stress and anxiety for ICU patients. A single 30-min session might work immediately without any adverse effects. However, the duration of the effect is unclear; thus, each patient's mood should be monitored after the music intervention.",0
357,"BACKGROUND: Theory-based and qualitative evaluations in pilot trials of complex clinical interventions help to understand quantitative results, as well as inform the feasibility and design of subsequent effectiveness and implementation trials. AIM: To explore patient, family, clinician and volunteer ('stakeholder') perspectives of the feasibility and acceptability of a multicomponent non-pharmacological delirium prevention intervention for adult patients with advanced cancer in four Australian palliative care units that participated in a phase II trial, the 'PRESERVE pilot study'. DESIGN: A trial-embedded qualitative study via semi-structured interviews and directed content analysis using Michie's Behaviour Change Wheel and the Theoretical Domains Framework. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-nine people involved in the trial: nurses (n = 17), physicians (n = 6), patients (n = 6), family caregivers (n = 4), physiotherapists (n = 3), a social worker, a pastoral care worker and a volunteer. RESULTS: Participants' perspectives aligned with the 'capability', 'opportunity' and 'motivation' domains of the applied frameworks. Of seven themes, three were around the alignment of the delirium prevention intervention with palliative care (intervention was considered routine care; intervention aligned with the compassionate and collaborative culture of palliative care; and differing views of palliative care priorities influenced perspectives of the intervention) and four were about study processes more directly related to adherence to the intervention (shared knowledge increased engagement with the intervention; impact of the intervention checklist on attention, delivery and documentation of the delirium prevention strategies; clinical roles and responsibilities; and addressing environmental barriers to delirium prevention). CONCLUSION: This theory-informed qualitative study identified multiple influences on the delivery and documentation of a pilot multicomponent non-pharmacological delirium prevention intervention in four palliative care units. Findings inform future definitive studies of delirium prevention in palliative care.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12617001070325; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=373168.",0
358,"INTRODUCTION: In mechanically ventilated patients, sedation strategies are a major determinant of outcome. The emergency department (ED) is the earliest exposure to mechanical ventilation for hundreds of thousands of patients annually in the USA. The one retrospective study that exists regarding ED sedation for mechanically ventilated patients showed a strong association between deep sedation in the ED and worse clinical outcomes. This finding suggests that the ED may be an optimal location to study the impact of early sedation on outcome, yet a lack of prospective studies represents a knowledge gap in this arena. This protocol describes a prospective observational study aimed at further characterising ED sedation practices and assessing the relationship between ED sedation and clinical outcomes. An association between ED sedation and clinical outcomes across multiple sites would suggest the need for changes in the current sedation strategies used in the ED, and provide evidence for future interventional studies in this field. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, prospective cohort study testing the hypothesis that deep sedation in the ED is associated with worse clinical outcomes. A cohort of over 300 mechanically ventilated ED patients will be included. The primary outcome is ventilator-free days, and secondary outcomes include hospital mortality, incidence of acute brain dysfunction and lengths of stay. Multivariable linear regression will test the hypothesis that deep sedation in the ED is associated with a decrease in ventilator-free days. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval of the study by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each participating site has been obtained prior to data collection on the first patient. This work will be disseminated by publication of peer-reviewed manuscripts, presentation in abstract form at scientific meetings and data sharing with other investigators through academically established means.",0
359,"Delirium is a common, disruptive, costly, and at times lethal condition found among patients in the acute care setting. Nurses can be the first to discover its presence and thereby reduce the time to treatment. Identifying delirium requires a knowledge of its clinical features, a mastery of the bedside cognitive mental status examination, critical judgment in distinguishing delirium from other psychiatric disorders, and appropriate nursing interventions based on ongoing assessment. In this article we review elements of such an approach and illustrate common clinical challenges for nurses with case examples.",0
360,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a frequent finding in the critically ill patient. Although it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, it is often not recognized by intensive care doctors. This review will address the main issues regarding delirium in critically ill patients. CONTENTS: Definition, incidence, mortality, risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of delirium in the critically ill. CONCLUSIONS: Deliriumis defined as a disturbance of consciousness, attention, cognition and perception that occurs frequently in critically ill patients. It occurs in as many as 80% of mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Risk factors for delirium include acute systemic illnesses, older age, pre-existing cognitive impairment, sleep deprivation, and medications with anticholinergic activity. Although new assessment tools are available for rapidly and accurately measuring deliriumin critically ill patients, healthcare professionals still do not regularly monitor for this condition. In recent years, the emphasis in the approach to delirium has shifted to systematic screening and prevention. Haloperidol remains the standard treatment for delirium, but there is some evidence for the efficacy of risperidone.",0
361,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the current status of physical restraint of patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit (NSICU) and analyze the factors influencing this measure using a cross-sectional study design. A total of 312 patients from four tertiary hospitals in NSICU were investigated in Beijing, China. The rate of physical restraint of patients in the NSICU was 42.9%. In 41.8% of cases, nurses performed physical restraint based on experience, and 45.5% of patients had physical restraint-related nursing records. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that physical restraint was associated with delirium, mild-to-moderate disturbance of consciousness, history of extubation, surgery, and use of sedatives within 24 hour. Analysis of related factors can provide a reference for nurses and managers to improve physical restraint strategies.",0
362,"BACKGROUND: Progressive mobility (PM) is a clinical intervention that influences complications experienced throughout critical illness. Early PM is a relevant topic in critical care practice literature and was principle to introducing a PM care guideline in an acute cardiothoracic/cardiovascular intensive care unit. PURPOSE: A noted challenge in the cardiothoracic/cardiovascular intensive care unit is caring for acute cardiac and pulmonary failure. Often, these patients require prolonged mechanical circulatory support via extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation or a ventricular assist device. This article describes safe and effective progressive mobilization for patients experiencing MCS in a case study format. This article also highlights how a multidisciplinary clinical team supports mobility practice in specific critical care roles. CONCLUSIONS: Post-intensive care syndrome is composed of various health implications that occur following critical illness. Recent data suggest improved care outcomes when critically ill patients are awake and participate in active physical rehabilitation as early as clinically possible. The case studies presented indicate that mobility, to the point of ambulation, is a feasible clinical expectation when patients present with substantial acute respiratory and cardiac failure and are managed with MCS. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Development of a PM guideline uses a critical appraisal of practice evidence, highlights multidisciplinary collaboration, and increases progression to ambulation. Mobility for complex patients is attainable, as demonstrated in the postguideline outcomes. The PM guideline provides structure to primary caregivers and promotes safe practices. The PM guideline facilitates an advanced level of care, promotes safe practices, champions holistic recovery, and encourages active patient involvement, goals satisfying to both patients and staff.",0

Through comprehensive assessment, careful review of medical records, contact with family and nursing home healthcare workers, it was determined that the patient's cognition and physical function declines were due to delirium resulting from the last time the patient had been hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). In order to prevent incidents of delirium, three nursing goals were set: controlling infection, avoidance of delirium recurrence, and recovery of prior levels of physical function and self-care ability. Nursing interventions used included UTI control, tube and catheter removal as early as possible, control of environmental factors, and muscle strength and exercise training. After two weeks of care, the patient could take food orally and the nasogastric (NG) tube had been successfully removed. Physical function and self-care ability improved from ""dependent"" to ""partial assistance"". Although UTI was controlled, removal of the foley tube failed due to prostate hypertrophy. No delirious event occurred during hospitalization and cognitive functions improved. From this experience, early assessment and intervention should be conducted for high-risk elderly patients in order to prevent delirious events and declines in cognitive and physical functions. The author hopes this case report will prove a useful reference to nurses charged with caring for elderly patients at risk for delirium.",0
366,"High numbers of patients experience severe acute stress in critical care units. Acute stress has been linked to post-critical care psychological morbidity, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previously, a preventive, complex psychological intervention [Psychological Outcomes following a nurse-led Preventative Psychological Intervention for critically ill patients (POPPI)] was developed by this research team, to be led by nurses, to reduce the development of PTSD symptom severity at 6 months., The objectives were to (1) standardise and refine the POPPI intervention, and, if feasible, (2) evaluate it in a cluster randomised clinical trial (RCT)., Two designs were used – (1) two feasibility studies to test the delivery and acceptability (to patients and staff) of the intervention, education package and support tools, and to test the trial procedures (i.e. recruitment and retention), and (2) a multicentre, parallel-group, cluster RCT with a baseline period and staggered roll-out of the intervention., This study was set in NHS adult, general critical care units., The participants were adult patients who were > 48 hours in a critical care unit, receiving level 3 care and able to consent., The intervention comprised three elements – (1) creating a therapeutic environment in critical care, (2) three stress support sessions for patients identified as acutely stressed and (3) a relaxation and recovery programme for patients identified as acutely stressed., Primary outcome – patient-reported symptom severity using the PTSD Symptom Scale – Self Report (PSS-SR) questionnaire (to measure clinical effectiveness) and incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and net monetary benefit at 6 months (to measure cost-effectiveness). Secondary outcomes – days alive and free from sedation to day 30; duration of critical care unit stay; PSS-SR score of > 18 points; depression, anxiety and health-related quality of life at 6 months; and lifetime cost-effectiveness., (1) A total of 127 participants were recruited to the intervention feasibility study from two sites and 86 were recruited to the RCT procedures feasibility study from another two sites. The education package, support tools and intervention were refined. (2) A total of 24 sites were randomised to the intervention or control arms. A total of 1458 participants were recruited. Twelve sites delivered the intervention during the intervention period: > 80% of patients received two or more stress support sessions and all 12 sites achieved the target of > 80% of clinical staff completing the POPPI online training. There was, however, variation in delivery across sites. There was little difference between baseline and intervention periods in the development of PTSD symptom severity (measured by mean PSS-SR score) at 6 months for surviving patients in either the intervention or the control group: treatment effect estimate −0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.58 to 2.52; p = 0.98. On average, the intervention decreased costs and slightly improved QALYs, leading to a positive incremental net benefit at 6 months (£835, 95% CI −£4322 to £5992), but with considerable statistical uncertainty surrounding these results. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the secondary outcomes or in the prespecified subgroup analyses., There was a risk of bias because different consent processes were used and as a result of the lack of blinding, which was mitigated as far as possible within the study design. The intervention started later than anticipated. Patients were not routinely monitored for delirium., Among level 3 patients who stayed > 48 hours in critical care, the delivery of a preventive, complex psychological intervention, led by nurses, did not reduce the development of PTSD symptom severity at 6 months, when compared with usual care., Prior to development and evaluation of subsequent psychological interventions, there is much to learn from post hoc analyses of the cluster RCT rich quantitative and qualitative data., This trial is registered as ISRCTN61088114 and ISRCTN53448131., This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services and Delivery Research programme and will be published in full in Health Services and Delivery Research; Vol. 23, No. 30.

367,"OBJECTIVE To adapt and validate a chart‐based delirium detection tool for use in critically ill adults. DESIGN Validation study. SETTING Medical‐surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in an academic hospital. MEASUREMENTS A chart‐based delirium detection tool (CHART‐DEL) was adapted for use in critically ill adults (CHART‐DEL‐ICU) and compared with prospective delirium assessments (i.e., clinical assessments (reference standard) by a research nurse trained by a neuropsychiatrist and routine delirium screening tools Confusion Assessment Method (CAM‐ICU)) and (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC)). The original CHART‐DEL tool was adapted to include physician‐reported ICDSC score (for probable delirium) and Richmond‐Agitation Sedation Scale score (for altered level of consciousness and agitation). Two trained chart abstractors blinded to all delirium assessments manually abstracted delirium‐related information from medical charts and electronic medical records and rated if delirium was present (four levels: uncertain, possible, probable, definite) or absent (no evidence). RESULTS: Charts were manually abstracted for delirium‐related information for 213 patients who were included in a prospective cohort study that included prospective delirium assessments. The CHART‐DEL‐ICU tool had excellent interrater reliability (kappa = 0.90). Compared to the reference standard, the sensitivity was 66.0% (95% CI = 59.3–72.3%) and specificity was 82.1% (95% CI = 78.0–85.7%), with a cut‐point that included definite, probable, possible, and uncertain delirium. The AUC of the CHART‐DEL‐ICU alone is 74.1% (95% CI = 70.4–77.8%) compared with the addition of the CAM‐ICU and ICDSC (CAM‐ICU/CHART‐DEL‐ICU: 80.9% (95% CI = 77.8–83.9%), P =.01; ICDSC/CHART‐DEL‐ICU: 79.2% (95% CI = 75.9–82.6%), P =.03). CONCLUSION: A chart‐based delirium detection tool has improved diagnostic accuracy when combined with routine delirium screening tools (CAM‐ICU and ICDSC), compared to a chart‐based method on its own. This presents a potential for retrospective detection of delirium from medical charts for research or to augment routine delirium screening methods to find missed cases of delirium.",0
368,"• There was high level of acceptance of virtual reality (VR) distraction therapy by intensive care unit (ICU) patients and providers. • VR intervention was safe, compatible with the ICU infrastructure and did not interfere with life support. • The risk of cybersickness in critically ill patients with VR therapy was minimal. • Bedside care providers in the ICU found the equipment to be well-functioning and easy to use. Delirium prevention requires optimal management of pain and anxiety. Given the limitations of current pharmacologic interventions, evaluation of novel non-pharmacological interventions is required. Virtual reality (VR) stimulation may be a promising intervention because of its capability to reduce psychophysiological stress, pain, and anxiety and to restore cognitive and attentional capacities. To ascertain patients' and providers' perceptions of acceptability and safety of VR intervention in the intensive care unit (ICU). We enrolled a cohort of 15 ICU patients and 21 health care providers to administer a 15-minute session showing a relaxing beach scene with VR headsets and nature sound effects. Participants were then asked to rate their experiences on a Likert scale survey. The majority of patients (86%, 12 of 14) rated the headsets as moderately to very comfortable. All had moderate or greater sense of presence in the virtual environment, and 79% (11 of 14) rated their overall experience at 3 or greater (5 indicating that they enjoyed it very much). Seventy-one percent (10 of 14) of the patients felt that their anxiety was better with VR, and 57% (8 of 14) did not notice a change in their pain or discomfort. All health care providers found the headset to be at least moderately comfortable and felt a moderate or greater sense of presence. All providers concluded that VR therapy should be available for their patients. Both groups experienced minimal side effects. In this prospective study of perceptions of VR therapy for ICU patients and health care providers, there was a high level of acceptance, with minimal side effects, for both groups despite their low levels of prior experience with virtual reality and video gaming.",0
369,"Background: Although families are increasingly seen as allies to improve delirium management and reduce its consequences, their involvement in the postcardiac surgery setting is challenging considering patients' critical state and short hospital stay. To our knowledge, no theory‐based nursing intervention exists that optimally supports the involvement of families in delirium management in the context of postcardiac surgery. Objectives: We aimed to develop MENTOR_D, a nursing intervention to support the involvement of families in delirium management. Methods: MENTOR_D was developed based on Sidani and Braden's (2011) intervention development framework. Narrative literature reviews paired with the clinical experience of an expert committee were used to inform these three steps: (1) develop an understanding of the problem under study; (2) define the objectives of the intervention and identify a theoretical framework for highlighting strategies to be used in the intervention; and (3) operationalize the intervention and identify its anticipated outcomes. Results: As a result of the three steps, the MENTOR_D nursing intervention relies on a caring–mentoring relationship between a nurse and the family. The aim of MENTOR_D is to increase the presence of the family at their relative's bedside and their involvement in delirium management. MENTOR_D's content is delivered over three phases that are organised around the visits of the family at the patient's bedside. During these phases, families used their knowledge of the patient to tailor the delirium management actions. These actions include orientation and reminiscence and were aimed at diminishing anxiety and increasing sense of self‐efficacy in families and diminishing delirium severity and improving recovery in patients. Conclusions: A deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of an intervention is key in its success to reach the targeted goals of effectiveness in practice. This understanding can be achieved through the careful development of a theory of the intervention before the operationalisation of its components and its testing. The proposed paper presents the theory of the MENTOR_D intervention, that is, its conceptualization and proposed mechanisms of action. Implications for practice: As delirium continues to be a major complication, this intervention is a promising solution to increase families' involvement in delirium management and highlights the support that nurses can offer to facilitate this involvement. With its use in future studies and practice, it can be further refined.",0
370,"The presence of delirium and its sequelae in critically ill pediatric patients is increasingly being recognized. Validated bedside screening tools nurses use have emerged to assist pediatric providers in the early identification of delirium. Nurses' compliance and scoring accuracy of delirium screening tools have improved following education and an increased understanding of delirium. The aims of this project were to increase nurses' knowledge of pediatric delirium and implement twice-daily delirium screening using the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) screening tool in a community-based pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Nursing knowledge was evaluated using a pre-/post-survey of pediatric delirium following a didactic delirium lecture and case study activity. Following the implementation of the CAPD tool into the electronic health record (EHR), twice-daily delirium screening was implemented and measured for screening compliance. Nursing knowledge decreased between the two measurement periods, although not significantly. Complete delirium screens, defined as screening occurring after the first ICU day, on non-sedated or lightly sedated patients at the end of the nursing shift occurred in 60% of scoring opportunities.",0
371,"There is an estimate of 700,000 to one million hospitalized patients who have a fall each year. Fall can lead to injury and prolong hospitalization. Patients have their own perception about falls and falls prevention measures. In order to prevent falls, nurses do perform fall risk assessment for all vulnerable hospitalized patients. But do not take into consideration the perception of patients on falls. The primary objective of the study was to correlate fall related perception of patients and nurses fall risk assessment. A descriptive correlational research design was used for the study. The study was conducted on patients who were at risk for fall and admitted in the general surgical wards of a tertiary care Centre. Study subjects were in the age group of 17- 65 years, spoke Tamil, Hindi or English and those with scores between 1-10 in the nurses fall risk assessment were included in the study. Those who had cognitive deficits, dementia, delirium and not ambulatory were excluded from the study. A simple random sampling method was used in recruiting study sample. A written consent was obtained from the patients who consented to participate. Following this a self-administered Fall-related Perceptions questionnaire was handed over to them in a language of their preference. Majority of the study participants were in the age group of 51-60 years. Gender distribution of males were high as 80.4%. About 42.7% were educated and 92.2% were employed and 92.4% had an annual income of less than Rs. 10000. Those who had undergone surgeries were 68.4% and none of the study subjects had a history of fall in the past. It was found that there is a positive relationship between the patients perception on the likelihood of falling and the nurses fall risk assessment. (r value = .261 p = .000 ).",0
372,"Objective: The study's main purpose has been to identify non-pharmacological measures in the management of delirium described by nurses of an adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Methods: It is a descriptive exploratory study with a qualitative approach that was performed with nurses working at an ICU from a public hospital in Brazil. Data were collected through a semi-structured interview and analyzed by the Thematic Content Analysis. Results: Nurses have knowledge about delirium and bring several non-pharmacological measures used in prevention and management. They underline the importance of knowledge about the subject, to identify and prevent symptoms, and also the presence of their relatives. The difficulties cited to implement these measures are barriers of physical structure, material resources and lack of information on this topic. Conclusion: It is essential to carry out permanent education activities regarding the addressed matter, furthermore, it is recommended to adopt daily scales aiming to monitor delirium.",0
373,"Delirium is associated with serious adverse health outcomes, particularly increased intensive care unit (ICU) stay and mortality rate. Critical care nurses lack sufficient knowledge about delirium and it remains undetected and poorly managed. In this protocol, the development, implementation and evaluation of the INDICATION (INnovative DelIrium CAre educaTION) program on delirium care knowledge, confidence, competence and clinical practice among critical care nurses in Taiwan is reported. A quasi-experimental trial will be performed to examine the effects of the INDICATION program. This study will be conducted at a teaching hospital in Taiwan. Two ICUs will provide the sites to recruit critical care nurses to participate. The INDICATION program for the intervention group will be delivered as a multi-modal delirium care education intervention consisting of: (1) one face-to-face education session; (2) five online delirium care learning modules; and (3) simulation education using scenario-based objective structured clinical examination. Participants in the comparison group will only receive: (1) One face-to-face education session; and 2) five online delirium care learning modules. Outcomes including knowledge, confidence and competence of delirium care will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately after the intervention (T1), and 6 weeks postintervention (T2) to evaluate changes over time. Study protocol. It is anticipated that the INDICATION program will improve the detection and management of delirium by critical care nurses. The INDICATION program highlights the importance of achieving outcomes to improve the knowledge, confidence, competence, and clinical performance of delirium care among critical care nurses.",0
374,"Emergence Delirium(ED) is a frequent occurrence in the pediatric PACU. The PAED scale is a research validated tool that has been shown to help nurses and anesthesiologists recognize and appropriately treat ED. OurPACU was currently not using a measuring tool. After learning about the scales already in place at a national conference, I discussed with the unit manager and she agreed that a PAED scale would be a valuable tool. The anesthesiologist that agreed to be physician support recommended that we carry this out as a research project. The aim of this study is to assess our PACU nurse's current knowledge of delirium, implement education, as well as encourage documentation of the PAED score. The potential benefits of the study include benefiting future pediatric patients and their nurses by improving how our institution approaches pediatric post-anesthesia delirium. IRBapproval was obtained. A survey was constructed to measure 2 things: 1) nurses knowledge of PAED pre and post education and implementation of a PAED scale 2) nurses confidence and satisfaction with several aspects of PAED pre and post education and implementation. An invitation email with a link to the online survey was sent to all nurses who worked in the pediatric PACU. Consent was in the email. The prospective participant can elect to participate in the survey or not participate. The consent described the anonymity of the survey by including the statement ""Identifiers will be removed and the de-identified information may be used for future research without additional informed consent from the subject."" Pre-interventiondata was collected via survey answers. Training for the PAED scale was implemented in concurrence with pediatric emergence delirium training by anesthesia. One month post intervention, the survey was re-sent. A final six-month post intervention survey was repeated. Each survey knowledge question was scored and results were analyzed using the T-test. A total of 15 PACU nurses participated. 14 responded to the one month survey and 7 responded to the 6 month survey. The most significant increase was knowledge of the PAED scale (↑ 58.3%, p < 0.0001)) as well as knowledge about patient risk factors (↑ 13.3%, p = 0.01) and dispelling common myths surrounding PAED (↑ 14.6%, p = 0.01). It is unclear at this time if the education initiative was ineffective in regards to the other goals of PAED knowledge, or if our pediatric PACU nurses simply pre-possessed much of this knowledge prior to implementation. Nursing confidence and satisfaction also increased with the largest gains being seen in their satisfaction with the tools they have at their disposal (↑28.8%) and the responsiveness of anesthesiologists (↑26.5%). The anesthesiologists were not included in the education sessions; therefore the increase in satisfaction is likely due to either a change in nursing perception or a change in anesthesiologist behavior due to nurses reporting the PAED score. A six-month follow-up survey was distributed to see how these gains change over time. The complete results are pending analysis. ThePAED scale is a research-validated tool that is easy to use to quickly identify and discern if emergence delirium is present. The nursing education initiative and implementation was successful in increasing knowledge of the PAED scale as well as increasing knowledge about patient risk factors and dispelling common myths surrounding PAED. The documentation piece has taken several months to get built as we have 3rd party vendors to develop most of our screens. Currently we are waiting for the screen to be included in our assessment options. During the study, a verbal reporting of the score was provided to the anesthesia provider. Further studies to determine documentation compliance would be helpful. The findings have demonstrated that the pediatric PACU nurses are more confident in identifying true ED. Additionally, it showed that they are more aware of the tool used to score delirium and what intervention(s) are the best to implement. The PAED scale chosen for this study promotes quick and easy scoring. Identifying emergence delirium quickly in pediatric patients is crucial to implementing the appropriate intervention(s). Future research desired is to determine if having the parent at bedside before onset of delirium would decrease the intensity and/or longevity of ED.",0

376,"Delirium is the most common neuropsychiatric challenge in cancer patients, particularly in the critically ill population. Without a screening method and constant vigilance by providers, delirium is often misdiagnosed. The purpose of our pilot study was to determine if an educational program targeting critical care medicine advanced practice providers (APPs) and fellows in an oncologic intensive care unit would increase APP knowledge of delirium and their level of comfort with delirium screening and management. Thirty-one APPs and fellows participated in the program. Scores on knowledge-based delirium assessments increased significantly after the intervention and at the 3-month follow-up (p < .0001 and p < .0225, respectively). Providers' comfort with delirium screening and management also improved after the intervention (p = .0020 and p < .0001, respectively) and decreased slightly at the 3-month follow-up (p = .1764 and p = .9840, respectively). A brief and focused APP-led educational initiative successfully improved knowledge of delirium and comfort with screening and management.",0
377,"Background: There is a paucity of studies synthesizing intensive care nurses' experiences of taking care of patients with delirium. A better understanding of nurses' experiences provides an opportunity to identify areas that can be strengthened to improve care. Aim: To gain insight into intensive care nurses' experiences of caring for patients with delirium through summarizing the existing qualitative studies in the area. Methods: Databases of Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Plus, PubMed, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global were searched for qualitative or mixed-method primary research studies, resulting in 269 records screened for eligibility. A three-stage thematic synthesis was followed. Findings: Nine studies were included in the review. Twelve descriptive themes emerged outlining critical care nurses' experiences in the four aspects of delirium care. For prevention, the common nursing themes were using holistic nursing care to promote nighttime sleep, orientate patients through human interaction, and promote early mobilization. Intensive care nurses' experience of delirium assessment included their perceived utility of screening, their understanding of using a screening tool, and their impression of integrating nursing assessment. In terms of treatment, nurses' experience focused on pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods, as well as their attitude toward the use of physical restraints and chemical sedation. Nurses' overall experience of caring for patients with delirium in intensive care units includedemotional exhaustion, physical fatigue, and the perceived low priority and inconsistency of delirium management. Conclusions: Intensive care nurses' complex experiences of caring for patients with delirium revolved around delirium prevention, assessment, treatment, and the overall process of care. Implications for practice include: multicomponent delirium prevention strategies, integrating the use of screening tools and nursing assessment for delirium detection, focusing on nonpharmacological interventions, and offering on-job support to nurses who care for delirious patients.",0
378,"Objective: The study's goal has been to gain further understanding regarding the nurses' grasp about the critical patient undergoing delirium events, and also the use of the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Methods: It is a descriptive-exploratory study, also prospective and with both qualitative and quantitative approach. The sampling was the nurses of an Intensive Care Unit; the sample consisted of 16 nurses who accepted to participate in all stages of the research. A pretest and another post-test were performed applying the data collection instrument consisting of 1 discursive question and 8 objective ones. In order to perform the data analysis were used content analysis and basic statistics. The research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee from the Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto, under the Legal Opinion No. 1.360.441. Results: In a comparison between the pretest and post-test, it was noticed that after the test the group was more prepared to identify delirium and with a higher degree of knowledge about the topic. Conclusion: The content update was shown as a tool for transforming clinical practice. It is very important to emphasize the need of continuing education in order to ensure the promotion of knowledge and quality in nursing care.",0
379,"Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the delirium knowledge level of intensive care nurses. Material and Methods: The study was conducted with 174 nurses working in intensive care units between 01.11.2020 and 31.12.2020. Data were collected using a nurse description form and the Delirium Knowledge Test for Intensive Care Nurses. The data were collected online using the snowball sampling method. In analysis of the data, descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman's correlation tests were used. Results: The mean age of the nurses in the study was 27.11±4.76 years, and 60.9% had been working in intensive care for less than one year. Fifty percent of nurses had received delirium training, and 56.3% used a diagnostic tool for delirium. Nurses' median score on the Delirium Knowledge for Intensive Care Nurses Test was 16 (0-21). Nurses most frequently (94.3%) incorrectly responded to the statement that 'non-pharmacological approaches are ineffective in preventing delirium.' Nurses who had received education concerning delirium achieved a significantly mean test score (p<0.05). Conclusion: Receipt of education concerning delirium was found to affect delirium knowledge levels. We recommend that professional and in-service training be enhanced, and that greater attention be paid to professional development in term of evidence-based knowledge.",0
380,"Background: Mechanical ventilation provides respiratory support for critically ill patients and is one of the most significant life-saving advancements in medical science and technology. Patients on mechanical ventilation are at high risk for complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sepsis, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism, barotrauma, and pulmonary edema (CDC, 2017). The comprehensive unit-based safety program for mechanically ventilated patients, also known as CUSP 4 MVP --VAP, is a collaborative program funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) that uses the CUSP principle (AHRQ, 2017). The CUSP principle employs clinical best practices to decrease complications from mechanical ventilation, improve patient safety, clinical outcome, and promote safety culture (AHRQ, 2017). Healthcare organizations who participated in this project reported a significant decrease in VAE rates (AIPSQ, n.d.). Objective: The purpose of this DNP Project is to assess the knowledge of critical care nurses of the evidence based interventions contained in the CUSP 4 MVP-VAP for preventing VAEs and their perceptions and attitudes about safety culture in the work area. The results of this project will allow the project team to understand potential barriers to implementation and provide opportunities to address concerns and needs of critical care nurses who play a significant role in the implementation of CUSP 4 MVP-VAP. Design: This DNP project used a quantitative, descriptive and correlational study to assess knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes of critical care nurses of the comprehensive unit-based safety program, for mechanically ventilated patients or the CUSP 4 MVP-VAP. Setting: The study was conducted at two facilities of Carondelet Health Network: the Carondelet Heart and Vascular Institute (CVHI) on St. Mary's campus and the medical-surgical ICU at St. Mary's hospital between October 18 to 25, 2017. Participants: 71 ICU nurses at St. Mary's hospital in Tucson, AZ. Measurements: A paper survey divided into three parts: demographic characteristics of participants, assessment of knowledge and perceptions and attitudes of nurses towards the new guidelines in the CUSP 4 MVP-VAP. Results: Majority of the ICU nurses are female, held a bachelor's degree, full-time employee, staff RN in their current position, experienced and expert RN in their clinical competence, and between 40 to 59 years of age. The knowledge scores of ICU nurses were between 10 to 70% with no significant correlation with participant's demographic characteristics at a-level of 0.05. The ICU nurses has the least knowledge about selective PUD prophylaxis, followed by incorporating early mobility program for intubated patients, recommended frequencies of ventilator circuit changes, tracheal suctioning, and changing the HME. Although 50% of nurses use RASS to keep target sedation level of -1 to +1, only 46% of participants were aware that RASS is not the appropriate tool for assessment of delirium in intubated patients. In addition, only 48% of nurses were aware of the recommended low tidal volume ventilation for ARDS and non-ARDS. The study found no correlation between knowledge of nurses of the CUSP 4 MVP-VAP and perceptions and attitudes of nurses of the evidence-based practice (p-value .474). Conclusion: Based on the study, the cardiovascular ICU and medical ICU at St. Mary's hospital require substantial need for educational improvement and cultural change. The unit should develop their own CUSP team that will assist in creating a unit-based policies and procedures aligned to current evidence-based practice in preventing ventilator-associated events.",0
381,"Background: Intensive care unit (ICU) diaries are recommended to address psychological sequelae following critical illness. Diaries are correlated with reduced prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder in survivors of critical illness and their families. Local Problem: Our ICU was not adequately meeting the psychological needs of patients and families. Methods: We established an interprofessional team to implement an ICU diary program in partnership with implementation of the ABCDEF (Assess, prevent, and manage pain; Both awakening and breathing trials; Choice of analgesia and sedation; Delirium: assess, prevent, and manage; Early mobility and exercise; Family engagement and empowerment) bundle and peer support programs. Staff knowledge and perception of ICU diaries were obtained. Interventions: Diaries were initiated for patients at high risk for post-intensive care syndrome, and entries by all ICU staff and family members/visitors were encouraged. Results: A total of 75 diaries were initiated between January 2017 and January 2019. The ICU diaries have been received positively by patients, family members, and staff. Conclusions: The ICU diary is a cost-effective and efficient intervention to help patients and family members cope with the burden of critical illness.",0
382,"Objective: The aim of the evidence implementation initiative was to improve the quality of care delivered to hospitalised patients at risk of, or with, delirium through the implementation of best practice recommendations. Background: Delirium is a prevalent serious medical condition that remains unrecognised or misdiagnosed in acute hospitals and is therefore left untreated. This paper reports on a hospital-wide quality improvement project which was undertaken in recognition of the Australian Delirium Clinical Care Standard and as a response to the cumulative rate of hospital-acquired delirium within a health organisation in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: The quality improvement project used the JBI (formerly known as Joanna Briggs Institute) evidence implementation framework. Briefly, the JBI evidence implementation approach is grounded in the audit, feedback and re-audit process along with a structured process for the identification and management of barriers to compliance with recommended clinical practices. Twelve nurses, who received support from external facilitators (implementation researchers), acted as delirium champions. Results: Baseline audit of 143 patient notes showed poor compliance (range 6% -- 67%) to recommended practices relating to screening, assessment, prevention and management of delirium. Barriers analysis revealed nurse-related (eg. lack of knowledge) and organisational level factors (e.g. absence of a hospital-wide policy/procedure for delirium management). A multicomponent strategy was implemented by all delirium champions in their respective units/wards. Follow-up audit of 151 patient notes demonstrated significant improvements in compliance with best practice recommendations for all aspects of delirium care. Discussion: The quality improvement activity highlighted that education remains one of the most important and critical first steps in facilitating change in clinical practice. Critical to the success of the project was the collaborative approach of the delirium champions across various specialties, which allowed for the sharing of expertise, knowledge and consensus-based decision making. The facilitation provided by the delirium champions and external facilitators was also a vital ingredient for the successful implementation of evidence-based practices. Conclusion: The quality improvement activity has improved nurses' screening and assessment of patients at risk of or with delirium, leading to improvements in its prevention and management. Collaborative efforts within the organisation facilitated the development of a standardised, evidence-based tool for delirium screening, assessment, prevention and management, and staff education resources. Partnership with patients and/or their families through education remains an area for ongoing improvement, as with discharge planning for patients with current or resolved delirium. What is already known about the topic? • Delirium care is a major challenge among healthcare practitioners and therefore the condition remains prevalent in many acute hospitals. In Australia, delirium has been identified as a high priority area for quality improvement. The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care released the Delirium Clinical Care Standard to ensure that patients at risk of delirium are identified early and receive preventative strategies, and that those with delirium receive optimal treatment to address their condition. What this paper adds: • This paper offers a detailed approach for evidence implementation to improve the quality of care delivered to hospitalised patients at risk of or with delirium. Key enablers were strong leadership support, sharing of experiences and knowledge, and the collective effort to problem solve and develop tools and resources for delirium.",0
383,"Topic: Many patients in intensive care units have frightening experiences and memories and subsequent post–intensive care syndrome, with psychiatric morbidity including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Intensive care unit diaries, written by staff members and families, support patients' understanding of what occurred and may alleviate their psychological suffering. Clinical Relevance: An increasing number of critical care nurses in the United States and elsewhere are implementing intensive care unit diaries, but implementation remains challenging. Purpose: To address emerging questions and support implementation in the United States, we held the Third International Intensive Care Unit Diary Conference as a 1-day preconference during the Seventh Annual Johns Hopkins Critical Care Rehabilitation Conference on November 1, 2018, in Baltimore, Maryland. This article summarizes the conference. Content Covered: Conference presentations included intensive care unit–related experiences of patients and families, psychosocial aspects of post–intensive care syndrome, the evolution of diaries, implementation strategies for intensive care unit diaries, special topics (eg, legal issues, electronic vs handwritten diaries, pediatric diaries, and time of handover), and psychosocial recovery.",0
384,"The article presents studies on evidence-based care featured in the January 2022 issue. Focus groups conducted with physicians, nurses and nursing assistants in Chile revealed the need for interprofessional collaborative strategies to support critical care staff working in end-of-life care. A variation in the practice of individualized family-centered developmental care for infants with congenital heart defect is seen and described in a survey of nurses from cardiovascular programs.",0
385,"Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing cardiovascular diseases, resulting in admissions to the medical cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) for advanced monitoring and interventions. Delirium has a complex etiology, caused by modifiable factors imposed on underlying medical or surgical conditions. The CICU environment is notorious for its delirium-inducing factors, such as receiving certain cardiac medications, lacking sleep, and undergo- ing medical procedures. More than half of patients with delirium experience agitation symptoms, posing a safety risk to the patient and the healthcare team involved and contributing to prolonged hospital stays. Nurses in the CICU are faced with the challenge of preventing and treating underlying causes of delirium and controlling delirium manifestations to protect their patients. We propose an alphabetical mnemonic, based on guideline-driven pharmacological interventions (ABCD: antipsychotics, benzo- diazepines, cholinesterase inhibitors, and dexmedetomidine), to facilitate nurses' understanding and recall of pharmacotherapy used in the complex management of delirium in the CICU.",0
386,"Sepsis affects 1.7 million Americans annually and often requires an intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Survivors of ICU can experience long-term negative effects. This quality improvement initiative was designed to increase compliance with ABCDEF bundle elements and improve clinical outcomes. A significant improvement was seen in the completion of spontaneous awakening and breathing trials (P = .002), delirium assessment (P = .041), and early mobility (P = .000), which was associated with a reduction in mortality and 30-day readmission rates. Findings were consistent with other research that demonstrated an improvement in care delivery and some clinical outcomes.",0
387,"Objective: To systematically review qualitative researches on management experience for delirium patients from ICU nurse,s and explore management experience and methods of ICU nurses in delirium, so as to provide evidence for developing clinical delirium management program. Methods: The following databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, CNKI, Wanfang Data and CBM were searched from inception to December 31,2018. Relevant qualitative studies on ICU nurses management experience for delirium patients were included. The JBI Critical Appraisal Tool for qualitative studies (2017 edition)was used to evaluate the quality of studies. Meta-synthesis was carried out by means of aggregation integration. Results: Totally 8 studies, containing 32 research findings, were included. Then 10 new categories were generated. Finally, 5 results were synthesized. As follows: Nurses'perception of delirium assessment: delirium assessment belongs to the secondary nursing level. And continuous assessment has advantages and disadvantages. Nurses' psychological feelings on nursing delirium patients: coexistence of positive and negative feelings. Treatment experience of delirium patients from ICU nurses:pay more attention to non-pharmacological approaches, and give different disposal methods according to different types of delirium. Practice plight of delirium management: ICU nurses find it difficult to implement management measures. And delirium management plan was lack of standardization norm. Experience and proposal in delirium management practice: to establish standardized delirium management system in ICU. And to strengthen the organization support and supervision. Conclusion: Nursing managers should attach great importance to ICU nurses' feelings and experience in delirium patients' nursing practice, give scientific guidance,and constantly improve delirium management program based on nurses' opinions.",0
388,"Background: High incidence of delirium in hospitalized patients has been reported in the United States and is significantly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The lack of knowledge and confidence in performing delirium assessment (KCDA) has led to significant underrecognition of delirium by nurses regardless of evidence-based education intervention. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a multimodal educational program (MEP) to enhance nurses' KCDA. Methods: A MEP including an online didactic with a video-simulation and 1:1 bedside coaching with delirium screening (DS) was conducted in the surgical intermediate-care unit of an academic medical center. A quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design was used. Results: Of 23 nurses, the majority were <41 years old (73.9%) and had at least a bachelor of science in nursing degree (78.3%) with <6 years of experience (60.9%). The overall KCDA scores and the performance of DS improved significantly after the MEP (p <.001). A positive correlation was noted between the changes of the KCDA scores (p =.009). Conclusions: The MEP demonstrated improvement in nurses' KCDA. The MEP should focus on an individualized learning approach with a targeted patient population, using current delirium screening tools. Implications for Nursing: Educational programs are recommended in either an orientation or continuing education program on nursing units. This is also recommended for use in other academic centers that encompass similar clinical settings and could possibly be considered for use in other disease processes.",0
389,"Depressed level of consciousness and delirium are associated with multiple complications in cognitive, perceptual and sensory functions in the patients of the intensive care units. The present study aimed to determine the effect of foot massage by a nurse and patient's family on the level of consciousness and delirium in patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU). This was a randomized parallel single-blind controlled trial. Seventy-five ICU were assigned in three groups (massage by a nurse, massage by patient's family and control group) by stratified block randomization method. Both feet were massaged with Swedish massage (10 min) once a day for six days by a nurse or patient's family. Delirium and level of consciousness was measured before, and post-intervention. The mean level of consciousness in all the three groups increased significantly one-week post-intervention. However, there was no significant difference in the level of consciousness among the three groups during the study. The frequency of delirium in the massage group by the family was 20% before the intervention, which decreased to 12% after intervention. In the massage group by a nurse and control group, 16% of the samples had delirium before the intervention. After the intervention, the prevalence of delirium was 8% in the massage group by a nurse, and it decreased to 12% in the control group, none of which was statistically significant. The use of Swedish foot massage did not change the level of consciousness and delirium of patients admitted to the ICU.",0
390,"The ABCDE bundle is an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to optimizing patient outcomes in the adult intensive care unit (ICU). The ABCDE bundle incorporates awakening, breathing, coordination, delirium monitoring and management, and early mobility to minimize potentially deleterious effects of prolonged hospitalization, including the development of delirium. Health care organizations that implement the ABCDE bundle have improved patient outcomes such as decreased ICU and hospital lengths of stay, decreased duration of mechanical ventilation, decreased prevalence and duration of delirium, and decreased health care costs. The purpose of this evidence-based practice project was to implement the ABCDE bundle in a six-bed general adult ICU of a rural community hospital. Implementation of the bundle decreased average patient hospital length of stay by 1.8 days, reduced length of mechanical ventilation by an average of 1 day, and established a baseline delirium prevalence of 19% over a 3-month time period. The results of this project indicate that the ABCDE bundle can be implemented in rural, community-based hospitals and provides a safe, cost-effective method for enhancing ICU patient outcomes.",0
391,"The article explores how COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in admissions to intensive care units (ICUs), which explain the link between ICU admissions and particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Topics include rise in patients presenting with PTSD related to their experiences of illness and medical treatment data are not available; and Staff need to wear personal protective equipment including masks that hamper communication and patients experiencing delirium.",0
392,"Background: Delirium has long-term consequences for intensive care unit patients. The project site, an urban academic hospital, did not previously use a validated delirium screening tool, and patients commonly received sedative medications to treat agitation. Objective: To minimize the risk of delirium by implementing the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) as the standard-of-care delirium assessment tool in the intensive care unit and by decreasing use of high-risk medications (ie, opioids and benzodiazepines). Methods: An observational pretest-posttest design was used to analyze deidentified patient data from electronic health records. The evidence-based practice intervention focused on educating nurses on high-risk medications and CAM-ICU implementation. Control charts, χ2 tests, and mixed regression models were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing delirium risk by decreasing use of high-risk medications. Results: High-risk medication use significantly decreased after intervention among patients at low risk for delirium (before intervention, 7.37%; after intervention, 3.92%; P <.001) and at high risk for delirium (before intervention, 4.73%; after intervention, 2.99%; P <.001). Hospital stays were significantly shorter in patients at low risk than at high risk for delirium (P <.001) but increased by a mean of 0.13 days with each additional high-risk medication used (P <.001). Conclusions: The variation of high-risk medication use was significantly controlled with the implementation of CAM-ICU and education. Nurses felt that hands-on training with the CAM-ICU increased their comfort in identifying patients at risk for delirium. Future work will focus on assessment accuracy.",0
393,"Background: Delirium is a common problem in patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Unit. Despite the importance, only less than 13% of cases are diagnosed by physicians and medical personnel. Objectives: The present research aimed to study knowledge and attitude of critical care nurses towards delirium. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Iran. Convenience sampling was used to enroll nurses (186 persons) working in intensive care units of Rasht educational hospitals affiliated to Guilan University of Medical Sciences in 2015. Data collection instruments included a three part questionnaire: demographic data, 15-item questionnaire formerly used by Guthrie and Sendelbach (2009) on nurses' knowledge about delirium, and -item questionnaire adopted from Herrero et al on attitude of the nurses towards delirium. The obtained data were statistically analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient and t-test in SPSS-20. Results: The majority of nurses (68.3%) have intermediate knowledge about delirium and only 24.6 percent reported good knowledge and 76 percent had positive attitude about delirium. Conclusion: Nursing knowledge and awareness have a significant role in improvement of the quality of healthcare and preventive measures, as well as the attitude of nurses towards dealing with delirium patients. Hence, it is recommended to give greater importance to academic courses and ongoing post-graduation professional development programs in the workplace, as a globally practiced healthcare quality improvement strategy.",0
395,"Delirium is a manifestation of brain injury or acute and generalized dysfunction of the upper cerebral cortical processes. In this way, it is important to analyze delirium more broadly as a symptom to understand and intervene taking into account that it is manifesting the presence of brain lesions whose consequences are deleterious to the neurological performance of patients. This article is intended to present a comprehensive approach of delirium analyzed from a symptom perspective and from theoretical and conceptual structure, such as the Dynamic Symptoms Model, specific to the nursing practice. A literature review related to delirium and components of Dynamic Symptoms Model was carried out. We searched the MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, SciELO, and Scopus databases using the terms Delirium, Intensive Care Units, Nursing, and Risk Factor. The existing literature provides evidence of the antecedents, experience, interventions, interactions, and consequences of delirium, which are components of the Model. Thus, the analysis from the Dynamic Symptoms Model perspective bears relevance and contributes to the understanding and approach of delirium.",0
396,"Most health care providers lack the education or clinical training to adequately recognize delirium. and are distressed when caring for patients with delirium (Akechi et al., 2010; Brajtman, Higuchi, & McPherson, 2006; Griffiths, Knight, Harwood, & Gladman, 2014; McCrow, Sullivan, & Beattie, 2014). Early recognition of delirium can improve patient safety and decrease the use of hospital resources (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2014). Although delirium knowledge and recognition are increased after implementation of education and the use of screening tools, more could be done to improve patient outcomes and increase sustainability of knowledge learned (Yanamadala et al., 2013; Soja et al., 2008; van den Boogaard et al., 2009; Pun et al., 2005). The purpose of this DNP project was to explore the perceptions, attitudes and behaviors of ICU nurses in a community hospital when caring for patients with delirium. Findings indicated that most nurses felt delirium is an underdiagnosed problem. Almost all agreed or strongly agreed that assessing ICU patients for delirium is a worthwhile intervention. Interestingly, 38.5% disagreed and 30.7% were neutral that delirium is largely preventative. Despite 69.2% of the participants agreeing that they felt heard by the provider when they suspect the patient is delirious, 76.9% are neutral that they are satisfied with the applied treatment. Despite agreeing that delirium is underdiagnosed, there is lack of knowledge regarding prevention and treatment of delirium. In this ICU, it would be beneficial to tailor the education prior to implementing any delirium screening tools. Results show that education should include: the types of delirium, delirium prevention strategies, RASS scales, importance of daily sedation vacations, and treatment. Education should be provided to both the nurses and the providers. In addition to this, ""buy in"" should be obtained from the providers to ensure that they will use data gathered from screening tools. Prior to implementing any screening tool, examples of screening tools should be provided to the staff, as well as a bedside demonstration to show ease of use. An additional study should be done to assess the sustainability after tailoring education based on perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors.",0
397,"In the clinical setting, simulation is emerging as an important educational technology for learning about contemporary clinical care. The aim of this case study was to illustrate the feasibility of simulation as a research translation mechanism. Designing and delivering a simulated learning activity for delirium prevention was a key implementation strategy in a larger study focused on translating research evidence into practice. Using evidence about delirium prevention, and in collaboration with key stakeholders, the simulation team developed a delirium prevention scenario that was conducted four times with nurses in the participating ward. This study suggests that the use of simulation design and delivery as a research translation mechanism is feasible. Based on this experience, further research into how simulations can function as research translation mechanisms is recommended, with a view to improve patient outcomes through supported practice change. • Research translation includes practice guidelines, decision aids, and care pathways. • Designing simulations may also be a useful research translation device. • In simulation design, research implementation barriers and facilitators emerge. • Stakeholders codesigning a simulation become advocates for practice change. • Simulation participation can produce confidence and competence in the new practice.",0
399,"Background: Delirium is not an uncommon problem in the emergency department (ED). In fact, according to the literature, one in ten patients experiences tills syndrome while in the ED, Routine screening tools are rarely utilized due to their complexity and the lack of training by healthcare providers. In addition, factors such as overcrowding and heavy work flows which characterize the ED, contribute to a reduce use of delirium screening tools. This work aims to review the literature in search of the latest evidence and to find the most effective tool that non specialized staff can use to early identify delirium in the elderly patients visiting the ED. Methods: A literature review was carried out on MEDLINE and CINAHL databases in the period between 13/04/2019 and 28/04/2019. The search was limited by 5-year retroactivity, full text availability, and English or Italian language. Results: Eleven studies were included in the review. Nine articles analized the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), its modified versions mCAM-ED, bCAM and CAM-ICU, the Assessment Test for delirium and cognitive impairment (4AT), the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) and its modified version mRASS. Two articles evaluated screening for clinical fragility and risk factors. Conclusions: The 4AT-scale appears to be more suitable for an early detection of delirium in the ED. In fact, it has a 2 minutes assessment, can be performed by non-psychiatrists and shows good diagnostic performances. However, further studies are needed to test its efficacy in the ED setting and be compared with other screening tools.",0
401,"Background: Managing anxiety, pain and delirium in critically ill patients is an ongoing challenge. Differences in physician practice, variations of pharmacological agents, as well as concentrations and units can increase the risk of medication error. Personal preferences, subjectivity, and nurses' level of expertise are variables when titrating analgesic and sedation infusions. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perceived benefits of implementing a standardized nurse-driven sedation protocol in the ICU. We examined its impact on the rates of medication errors and perceptions of staff using the protocol. Design: This descriptive study used a survey to collect data. Sample: We used a convenience sample of 75 nurses who worked in the ICU during the implementation of the sedation protocol. Results: Analysis of variance was completed comparing all sub-scale scores. No statistical significance was found, but scores did not decrease over time. No medication errors or near misses were reported throughout the sedation protocol implementation. Qualitative comments from staff provided feedback and assisted in identifying issues with the protocol. Conclusion: We believe that the implementation of the sedation protocol has been beneficial in our adult ICU. Findings indicate that with experience and resources nurses can manage anxiety, pain and delirium more confidently than without such a protocol. Critical care nurses, given the right tools, education, and support can make decisions that promote positive outcomes for patients receiving sedation and analgesia in the ICU.",0
402,"Background Despite practice guidelines promoting delirium assessment in intensive care, few data exist regarding current delirium assessment practices among nurses and how these practices compare with those for sedation assessment. Objectives To identify current practices and perceptions of intensive care nurses regarding delirium assessment and to compare practices for assessing delirium with practices for assessing sedation. Methods A paper/Web-based survey was administered to 601 staff nurses working in 16 intensive care units at 5 acute care hospitals with sedation guidelines specifying delirium assessment in the Boston, Massachusetts area. Results Overall, 331 nurses (55%) responded. Only 3% ranked delirium as the most important condition to evaluate, compared with altered level of consciousness (44%), presence of pain (23%), or improper placement of an invasive device (21%). Delirium assessment was less common than sedation assessment (47% vs 98%, P < .001) and was more common among nurses who worked in medical intensive care units (55% vs 40%, P = .03) and at academic centers (53% vs 13%, P < .001). Preferred methods for assessing delirium included assessing ability to follow commands (78%), checking for agitation-related events (71%), the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (36%), the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (11%), and psychiatric consultation (9%). Barriers to assessment included intubation (38%), complexity of the tool for assessing delirium (34%), and sedation level (13%). Conclusions Practice and perceptions of delirium assessment vary widely among critical care nurses despite the presence of institutional sedation guidelines that promote delirium assessment.",0
403,"Background: Legislation, guidelines and accreditation standards call for the minimization of physical restraints, yet their use remains common in intensive care units (ICUs) both in Canada and internationally. In Canada, physical restraints are prescribed by physicians. However, assessment of their need, application, and removal are primarily the responsibility of ICU nurses. Objectives: We sought to describe Canadian ICU nurses' decisionmaking and practices of physical restraint application and discontinuation, as well as alternative measures attempted prior to their use for critically ill adults. Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational study in two medical-surgical ICUs (tertiary academic and large community teaching hospital) of physical restraint use. Results: We collected physical restraint data from the medical records of 141 patients from October 2011 to September 2012. Most restrained patients were mechanically ventilated (n = 118, 84%). Of the 247 reasons for restraint application identified for these 141 patients, agitation (n = 107, 43%), restlessness (n = 42, 17%) and use as a precautionary measure (n = 42, 17%) were the most commonly documented. Of the 167 behaviours observed and documented by nurses as indicative of agitation, pulling at the endotracheal tube or other lines/tubes (n = 111, 66%) was most commonly cited. Nurses documented the use of various strategies as an alternative to physical restraint prior to their use for 46 (33%) patients. Of the 96 alternative strategies attempted, communication comprising reorientation and reminders was the most frequently documented (n = 26, 27%). Nurses reported having considered removing restraints during their shift for 61 (43%) patients. The criterion most commonly deemed essential for restraint removal was a calm patient (51 of the 104 reasons listed, 49%). Conclusions: Our study suggests that patient behaviour indicative of agitation was the most common reason for physical restraint application. Use as a precautionary measure and in situations where nurses' ability to be present at the bedside was reduced, as well as the limited use of alternative measures prior to physical restraint suggest restraint minimization may not be optimal.",0
404,"Objective To report on the use of Delirium Care Pathways to screen for and recognise delirium by Aged Care Services in Emergency Teams ( ASETs) at five metropolitan hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. Knowledge of delirium and the use of Delirium Care Pathways are vital to ensure that older people presenting with delirium receive best practice care. Methods An audit of 205 randomly selected medical records of clients over 65 years presenting to an ASET was conducted. Results Delirium was recorded in the medical records notes of four clients (2%). However, the auditors identified another 27 clients with symptoms of delirium. Conclusions Delirium is still frequently undiagnosed and misdiagnosed in older people presenting to emergency departments. This indicates a need for further education and professional development for and by health-care practitioners. Only with greater awareness of delirium will the care and health outcomes of older adults presenting with delirium in acute care settings improve.",0
405,"Purpose/goals: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are at high risk of experiencing communication barriers, which can have several negative consequences such as distress, anxiety, poor symptom management and increased use of restraints. This presentation will describe how, with training and simple tools, clinicians can better assess for communication barriers, and enhance nurse-patient communication by selecting appropriate tools and communication strategies. Outcome 1: Identify three types of communication barriers that intensive care unit (ICU) patients commonly experience Outcome 2: Demonstrate one communication strategy to address a mechanical communication barrier Outcome 3: Demonstrate one communication strategy to address a cognitive communication barrier Session description: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients experience communication barriers for many reasons including: intubation, frequent comorbidities associated with critical illness, and the limitations in systemic supports to facilitate effective clinician-patient communication. ICU patients who are unable to speak often are limited to yes/no questions, mouthing words, and using gestures. As a result, communication exchanges between patients and nurses tend to be infrequent, brief, mostly nurse-directed, focused on basic care needs, and rarely result in the patient's complete message being understood. This communication difficulty is associated with increased patient distress, frustration, anxiety, agitation, and sleeplessness; inaccurate symptom assessment, adverse events; and increased use of both chemical and physical restraints. In 2016-17, an ICU admitted 742 patients per year, 68% experience mechanical ventilation, and 53% have a positive delirium screen. Despite the high rate of communication difficulties in this population, ICU nurses and respiratory therapists (RTs) receive no education on how to address communication issues in critical care education. Effective, low-cost strategies that enhance nurse-patient communication exist. This presentation will outline how the unit adapted and implemented the strategies outlined in the Study of Patient-Nurse Effectiveness with Assisted Communication Strategies (i.e., SPEACs trial). This included offering assistive and augmentative communication training, as well as developing a communication cart to store a variety of inexpensive tools to aid clinicians to assess for communication barriers and select appropriate tools.",0
406,"Delirium is a frequent, yet poorly assessed and managed complication in the intensive care unit (ICU). Morbidity and mortality increase with delirium; and the cognitive impairment often persists after hospital discharge affecting quality of life and ability to function independently. Interdisciplinary delirium prevention and mitigation strategies are necessary to effectively assess and manage this syndrome with critical care nurses playing a key role in the process. Lack of nursing knowledge has been identified as a key barrier to comprehensive delirium assessments. Understanding delirium, including the identification of key presenting symptoms, and associated risk factors, is essential for bedside nurses to employ effective assessment and management strategies. This article provides nurses with a concise review of delirium from assessment to management for critically ill patients in the adult ICU environment. Delirium is a frequent complication in the intensive care unit (ICU). Previously considered an inevitable and unimportant side effect of critical illness, its incidence is higher than initially realized; it significantly impacts morbidity and mortality, healthcare costs, and other long-term effects on the patient and society (Devlin, Brummel, & Al-Qadheeb, 2012). As a result, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) released clinical practice guidelines for the management of pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD) recommending an interdisciplinary management approach and the use of validated screening tools (Barr et al., 2013). Despite the explosion of research on the pathophysiology of delirium, its prevention, management, and mitigating long term sequelae, delirium in the ICU remains poorly understood and assessed by many nurses.",0
407,"Objective: Sleep disruption occurs frequently in critically ill patients. The primary aim of this study was to examine the effect of quiet time (QT) on patient sedation frequency, sedation and delirium scores; and to determine if consecutive QTs influenced physiologic measures (heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure and respiratory rate). Method: A prospective study of a quiet time protocol was conducted with 72 adult patients on mechanical ventilation. Setting: A Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) in the Midwest region of the United States. Results: Sedation was given less frequently after QT (p = 0.045). Those who were agitated prior to QT were more likely to be at goal sedation after QT (p< 0.001). Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients who were negative on the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) prior to QT remained delirium free after QT. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) for three consecutive QTs showed a significant difference for respiratory rate (p = 0.035). Conclusion: QT may influence sedation administration and promote patient rest. Future studies are required to further understand the influence of QT on mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit.",0

410,"Objective To systematically review the experience of ICU nurses，caring for adult delirium patients and provide evidence for healthcare providers ' formulating the delirium care program. Methods In this meta-synthesis, electronic databases (including The Cochrane Library, EMbase, Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, PsycINFO, CENAHL, Scopus, ProQuest, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang Data and VIP) were searched to June 2019 for full-text papers, in order to collect qualitative studies in ICU nurses ' experience of caring for adult delirium patients. The JBI Critical Appraisal Tool for qualitative studies (2017 edition) was used to evaluate the quality of included studies. Results A total of 6 studies containing 81 clear and complete findings were included. Then all findings were integrated into 10 categories and 4 synthesized results were generated finally.①Nurses perceived cognitive deficits on delirium；②Nurses suffered varying degrees of physical and psychological burden, and gain professional achievements ；③ Nurses were stuck in decision-making of delirium care because of many factors ；④Nurses learned through the past experiences and presented many recommendations. Conclusion Healthcare providers should pay more attention to the feelings and experience of ICU nurses ' caring for adult delirium patients. Besides, the psychological, knowledge and technical support should be given to ICU nurses and facilitating the management of delirium nursing practice is important.",0
411,"The aim of this exploratory study was to assess whether nurses from a regional base hospital had sufficient theoretical knowledge to assess and manage delirium in the clinical setting. Delirium is a well-recognised, preventable condition commonly seen in the older person. Numerous assessment tools have been developed to identify delirium in the clinical setting. Yet despite the effectiveness of these tools, many nurses remain unable to accurately detect the delirious patient and instead rely on clinical experience to make a diagnosis of delirium, often inappropriately. A self-administered survey based on a true/false questionnaire was used. In addition, a Likert scale was used to assess nurses' perceived levels of confidence in detecting and managing the delirious patient. A convenience sample of 130 nurses from four acute adult wards at a regional base hospital was provided with a 40-item delirium knowledge questionnaire. The nurses answered an average of 80 percent of questions correctly. Statistical differences, using non-parametric tests, were found mainly between nursing designation and confidence levels; identification of predisposing and precipitating factors; and knowledge of delirium training. Overall, the staff nurse grade performed well, while nurse educators performing poorly. Nurses in this study held substantial theoretical knowledge about delirium. However, anecdotal evidence suggests this empirical knowing is not always transposed into practical application -- it would seem nurses know more than they do.",0
412,"Purpose: This study was conducted to identify the perception, barriers, and importance of delirium assessment of intensive care unit nurses utilizing a tool for delirium assessment. Methods: The subjects were 150 intensive care unit nurses who routinely use the CAM-ICU to screen delirium. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive statistics and ranking. Results: Most intensive care unit nurses had experience of education about delirium and delirium assessment, and had assessed over once in a shift. However, a small number of nurses recognized utilizing their assessment result and the effect on higher mortality and underdiagnosed and preventable problem. The first rank of barriers was being too busy to assess patients and the second was difficulty of interpreting intubated patients. The importance of delirium assessment was considered lower than assessing catheter placement and level of pain. Conclusion: The study identified intensive care unit nurses’ use of a delirium assessment tool, and the perception, barriers, and importance of delirium assessment. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop education programs to improve the early recognition of delirium by intensive care unit nurses.",0
413,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the attributes, antecedents, and consequences of post-intensive care syndrome. Methods: The study was conducted in accordance with Walker and Avant’s conceptual analysis process. We searched the Medline, ProQuest, Google scholar, NANET (Korean National Assembly Library), and RISS (Korean Education and Research Information Service) databases resulting in 29 studies for in-depth review. Results: The attributes of post-intensive care syndrome include (1) new or worsening impairment persisting after discharge, (2) physical impairment, (3) psychological impairment, (4) cognitive impairment, and (5) symptom experience. The antecedents of the concept include a critical condition that requires intensive care, stressful events, immobility, sedation, delirium, insomnia, frailty, and invasive procedures. The consequences of post-intensive care syndrome are increased dependency in activities of daily life, decreased social interaction, delayed return to previous occupation, decreased quality of life, familial post-intensive care syndrome, and readmission/death. Conclusion: The concept of post-intensive care syndrome has multifaceted and integrative features. Further research needs to be conducted to develop a measurement tool that reflects the attributes of the concept and to develop multidisciplinary interventions to prevent post-intensive care syndrome.",0
414,"End-of-life assessments aim to help dying patients and their families plan clinical interventions in advance and prepare them for a peaceful end of life, in which the patient accepts life and death, and the family accepts the patient's departure. It is important to assess whether death is imminent within a few days, because critical hospice care is provided intensively during that period. The following five changes constitute objective evidence of the end of life: diminished daily living performance, decreased food intake, changes in consciousness and increased sleep quantity, worsening of respiratory distress, and end-stage delirium. As subjective evidence, it is suggested that sensitive perceptions of experienced nurses and the feelings of family members caring for patients should also be considered. When notifying a patient or family members that the end of life is approaching, the members of the multidisciplinary hospice team must communicate with each other, share accurate information, and provide consistent explanations. They must also listen to non-verbal communication in an empathic and supportive manner.",0
415,"Purpose: To investigate the post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and to analyze the factors affecting the quality of life (QoL) of survivors of critical illness. Methods: Subjects were 114 outpatients who had been discharged from intensive care units of a university hospital in B city, Korea. From July 30 through September 30, 2015, PICS was assessed using the Korean Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale, Korean Instrumental/Activities of Daily Living (K-I/ADL) index, and handwriting transformation, while physical and mental health-related QoL was measured using the SF-12. Results: Of the subjects, 39.5% were screened for mild cognitive disorder and 23.7% experienced handwriting transformation after discharge. Multiple regression analysis revealed that restraint application, current job, time of ≥36 months after discharge, depression, anxiety, and handwriting transformation accounted for 40.9% of the physical health-related QoL, and depression, anxiety and experience of delirium accounted for 62.4% of the mental health-related QoL. Conclusions: It is necessary to make efforts to reduce restraint application in intensive care units and prevent the occurrence of delirium, with the objective of reducing PICS and improving the QoL of critical illness survivors.",0
416,"Purpose: To determine the perceived quality of sleep in critically ill patients in a surgical trauma burn intensive care unit (ICU) and to identify common elements that disrupt sleep. Patients in ICUs are highly vulnerable to the negative effects of poor sleep environments. Accordingly, identification of patients' perceptions of the sleep experience is crucial to implementing practices that promote feelings of rest and sleep in ICUs. Background: The literature demonstrates that sleep is a vital function for healing and surviving a critical illness. Sleep deprivation can cause weakened immune systems, delirium, extended ICU stays, and worsened outcomes. Causes of sleep deprivation during hospitalization include factors such as noise, pain, and medications. Some causes cannot be readily resolved, but many of them can be alleviated with education and targeted interventions. Method: After the study was approved by the institutional review board, patients were screened to meet inclusion criteria. Patients were administered the 6-question Richard Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ), consisting of a 0 to 100 scale, with a low score indicating poor sleep quality. Patients were also asked an open-ended question to attain their perceptions of what affected their sleep experience. A total RCSQ score was calculated for each patient. Descriptive statistics were computed for each RCSQ question and element of demographic information. Correlations were explored between RCSQ scores and demographic information. Qualitative analyses were performed on the open-ended question to identify primary themes. Results: Overall, participants reported their sleep quality as poor. Although patients fell asleep quickly, they recounted sleeping lightly. Once awakened, patients struggled to get back to sleep. The results show opportunity for targeted interventions in ICUs to improve sleep quality. Potential interventions may include reducing noxious stimuli, increasing comfort, and improving pain control. A sleep bundle would assist nurses to initiate measures to limit interruptions and improve overall sleep quality.",0
417,"The issue of delirium is frequently observed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is a distressing medical syndrome for patients and family members, as well as hospital staff. Even when diagnosed, the treatm ent options are varied and there is evidence that even with treatment, the patient is still left with long lasting effects. At present, this condition cannot be prevented or treated well with every patient, therefore, early identification of delirium and prom otion of practices to mitigate and treat the syndrome is necessary. Research was planned in one ICU and com pleted with the following aims: 1. assess if the introduction of delirium education will improve ICU nurses' knowledge of delirium after a two-m onth period of time, 2. assess if any knowledge change brought about by the introduction of education is influenced by the nurse having a nursing degree versus a diploma, and 3. assess if any knowledge change brought about is influenced by a nurse’s years of experience (less than three years or greater). This research used four-hour educational sessions with the nurses in the unit with a pre test and a six-week post test. The results were analyzed using a W ilcoxon signed-rank test. A mean and mode for each group will be reported and the percentage of each group that obtained the right question prel post will be reported. The results showed that education and/ or experience did not influence knowledge uptake and that the main knowledge of delirium was low at both testing points, thus indicating that education alone is not enough to influence knowledge of this multi-factorial syndrome.",0
418,"Purpose/Goals: This presentation will review integration of both the ABCDEF (Assess and treat pain, Both spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, Choice of analgesia and sedation, Delirium assess, prevent and manage, Early mobility and exercise, Family engagement/empowerment) Bundle and the 2018 Pain, Agitation, Delirium, Immobility and Sleep Disruption (PADIS) clinical practice guidelines update using a case study approach. Critical care nurses work collaboratively to integrate current evidence, which informs their practice and, thus, improves patient and family outcomes. Pre-Requisites: It would be beneficial to have knowledge and skill in assessing and managing pain, agitation, delirium, as well as mobility and sleep promotion strategies in the adult intensive care population, but not mandatory for attendance. Outcome 1: Identify those at risk/discuss prevention for developing alterations in each domain from 2018 PADIS Clinical Practice Guidelines Outcome 2: Select and apply two best practice management strategies for patients to optimize each domain from PADIS 2018 guidelines Outcome 3: Compare and contrast ABCDEF bundle to PADIS guidelines, thus describing how implementing the ABCDEF bundle promotes integration of PADIS guidelines in practice Session Description: The path chosen to provide care to critically ill patients and families 25 years ago has changed from caring for ventilated, heavily sedated, restrained patients with limited family visitation to now caring for those who are awake, mobile whilst being ventilated and supported by family presence. Critical care patients continue to experience increased risks of symptoms during their hospitalization including pain, agitation, delirium, weakness and sleep deprivation, which increases their risk for negative outcomes including in death, mechanical ventilation, and coma (Devlin, Skrobik, Gelinas, Needham et al., 2018; Ely, 2017; Pun, Balas, Barnes-Daly, Thompson, et al., 2019). Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of Pain, Agitation/sedation, and Delirium were revised in 2018 to include Immobility and Sleep disruption (PADIS) (Devlin et al., 2018). The Assess and treat pain, Both spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, Choice of analgesia and sedation, Delirium assess, prevent and manage, Early mobility and exercise, Family engagement/empowerment Bundle, or ABCDEF bundle, by focusing on symptom assessment, prevention and management is an evolving quality improvement initiative which serves to reduce risks associated with critical illness with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes (Ely, 2017). As integral members of the interprofessional healthcare team, critical care nurses have a crucial role to play from integrating ABCDEF bundle to identification of those at risk for, prevention and providing evidence-based treatments for all PADIS domain areas, thus promoting high-quality, safe and effective patient and family centred care.",0
420,"Delirium, a syndrome that results in high morbidity and mortality rates in the elderly, continues to be underrecognized by physicians and nurses. Factors influencing the underrecognition of delirium are specific to individual institutions and their care providers. The factors leading to the underrecognition of delirium must be identified so that changes can be made to increase early recognition. A case study conducted in a critical care unit in a midwestern hospital from interviews of nurses, chart audit, and patient observation, identified two major problems associated with the lack of recognition of delirium in that institution: (1) lack of knowledge on the part of nurses about the criteria and methods of detecting delirium, and (2) ineffective communication between all staff members in relaying symptoms of onset of the disorder. As a result of this study, staff education, assessment protocols, and improved communication and documentation techniques are indicated as targeted methods for improving recognition and treatment of delirium in this setting. Similar case studies can be performed to evaluate institutional practice, and thereby identify barriers to early recognition of delirium.",0
421,"Aim: To discern and understand the responses of nurses to the survivorship needs of patients and family members in adult critical care units. Background: The critical care environment is a demanding place of work which may limit nurses to immediacy of care, such as the proximity to death and the pressure of work. Design: A constructivist grounded theory approach with constant comparative analysis. Methods: As part of a wider study and following ethical approval, eleven critical care nurses working within a general adult critical care unit were interviewed with respect to their experiences in meeting the psychosocial needs of patients and family members. Through the process of constant comparative analysis, an overarching selective code was constructed. EQUATOR guidelines for qualitative research (COREQ) were applied. Results: The data illuminated a path of developing expertise permitting integration of physical, psychological and family care with technology and humanity. Gaining such proficiency is demanding, and the data presented reveal the challenges that nurses experience along the way. Conclusion: The study confirms that working within a critical care environment is an emotionally charged challenge and may incur an emotional cost. Nurses can find themselves bounded by the walls of the critical care unit and experience personal and professional conflicts in their role. Nurses bear witness to the early stages of the survivorship trajectory but are limited in their support of ongoing needs. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Critical care nurses can experience personal and professional conflicts when caring for both patients and families. This can lead to moral distress and may contribute to compassion fatigue. Critical care nurses appear bounded to the delivery of physiological and technical care, in the moment, as demanded by the patient's acuity. Consequentially, this limits nurses' ability to support the onward survivorship trajectory. Increased pressure and demands on critical care beds have contributed further to occupational stress in this care setting.",0
423,"Objective To explore the cognition and management needs of ICU nurses for delirium, and to provide suggestions and evidence for the standardization of ICU delirium management and methods in the hospital. Methods Using the phenomenological research in the qualitative research, we conducted in - depth interviews with 10 ICU nurses in a tertiary hospital in Hengyang City. The content analysis method was used to analyze, code, collect, refine the theme and verify the theme to ensure the accuracy of the theme. Results Four themes were extracted from the interview results: limited knowledge of delirium, feelings of delirium care, factors influencing ICU delirium management, and ICU delirium management needs. Conclusion In order to improve the quality of ICU delirium management, it is necessary to strengthen the systematic training of ICU nurses"" delirium knowledge to meet the needs of delirium management. Under the general trend of smart medical care, delirium management and Internet technology are combined to form an intelligent, systematic and scientific Management of delirium.",0
424,"The aim of this study was to investigate high-priority training needs by analysing the perceived importance and self-reported performance of nurses' delirium care competency. A cross-sectional survey with a convenience sample of 255 Korean intensive care units nurses. Intensive care units in the Republic of Korea. Intensive care unit nurses' delirium care competency. Exploratory factor analysis of the Nurse Delirium Care Competency Scale showed a six-factor structure, which accounted for 67.51% of the variance in nurses' delirium care competency: management algorithm, prevention, communication, nursing management, assessment, and collaboration. The self-reported performance scores of all six factors were significantly lower than their perceived importance scores. The delirium assessment factor was identified as a high training priority on the importance-performance matrix for new graduate nurses. Training programmes should be developed considering the six delirium care competency factors identified in this study. Further, nurse educators must adopt active educational modalities such as case-based small group learning and simulation-based learning to improve nurse competency in recognising and managing delirium.",0
426,"The aim of this study was to develop delirium care pathways (DCPs) useable and relevant for registered practitioners in all care settings: community; acute; and nursing homes. A qualitative approach was adopted to develop the pathways inductively. Focus groups and one-to-one interviews with registered practitioners (n = 45) working as managers, practitioners and clinical nurse consultants were undertaken to develop draft versions of the pathways, which was pilot trialled across 19 clinical settings. The publication of the DCPs was a concise and easily readable document for registered practitioners who required immediate guidance on how to implement evidence-based delirium care for older people and their family carers, including three patient journeys explaining best-practice delirium care in community, acute and nursing home care settings, a webpage resource and printable posters of the pathways' patient journeys to promote the use of the pathways in clinical settings. The work undertaken to develop the pathways was further developed through new policy documents, state-wide initiatives to improve delirium care in hospitals, development of educational resources on delirium care and other knowledge translation projects on this topic.",0
427,"Background: Cardiovascular disease is common among old people and many undergo cardiac surgery. Scientific knowledge is available on cardiac surgery from several perspectives. However, we found few studies focusing on older patients' experiences of cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to illuminate experiences of undergoing cardiac surgery among older people diagnosed with postoperative delirium, a one year follow-up. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 49 participants (aged >70 years) diagnosed with delirium after cardiac surgery. Data were collected in Sweden during 2010 through individual, semi-structured interviews in participants' homes one year after surgery. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Four themes with sub-themes were formulated: Feeling drained of viability includes having a body under attack, losing strength and being close to death. Feeling trapped in a weird world describes participants having hallucinations, being in a nightmare and being remorseful for their behavior. Being met with disrespect includes feeling disappointed, being forced, and feeling like cargo. On the other hand, Feeling safe, including being in supportive hands and feeling grateful, points to participants' experiences of good care and the gift of getting a second chance in life. Conclusions: Even one year after cardiac surgery, participants described in detail feelings of extreme vulnerability and frailty. They also had felt completely in the hands of the health care professionals. Participants described experiences of hallucinations and nightmares during hospitalization. Cardiac surgery was a unique, fearful, traumatic and unpleasant experience yet could also include pleasant or rewarding aspects. It seems that health care professionals need deeper knowledge on postoperative delirium in order to prevent, detect and treat delirium to avoid and relieve the suffering these experiences might cause.",0
429,"Aims and objectives: To explore nurse and nursing assistant reflections on the care of older patients with cognitive impairment who have experienced a fall. Background: While there are evidence‐based clinical guidelines for the prevention and management of falls and for the care of older people with cognitive impairment, the falls rates for older people with cognitive impairment are three times as high as those without. Design: Critical incident technique. Methods: Eleven registered and two enrolled nurses and four assistants in nursing working in one subacute and two acute wards within two hospitals of a tertiary level health service in south‐east Queensland. Individual semistructured interviews focused on two past events when a patient with cognitive impairment had fallen in hospital: one when there was minimal harm and the second when there was significant harm. Thematic analysis was undertaken. The COREQ checklist was followed. Results: Three themes emerged from 23 reflective accounts of fall events: ""direct observation is confounded by multiple observers"" and ""knowing the person has cognitive impairment is not enough,"" and ""want to rely on the guideline but unsure how to enact it."" While participants were aware of the falls prevention policy and techniques available to prevent falls, the implementation of these was challenging due to the complexity of care required by the older person with cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Falls prevention for older people with cognitive impairment is complex and belies the simple application of policy. Relevance to clinical practice: To reduce falls, nurses can involve the family to support ""knowing the patient"" to enable prediction of impulsive actions; shift the focus of in‐service from lectures to specific case presentations, with collaborative analysis on person‐focused strategies to prevent falls in older people with cognitive impairment; and reconsider the sitter role from simple observer to assistant, focused on ambulation and supporting independence in activities of daily living.",0
430,"Critically ill patients receiving palliative care at the end of life are at high risk for experiencing pain, dyspnea, and death rattle. Nearly all these patients are at risk for the development of delirium. Patients who are alert may experience anxiety. Advanced practice nurses and staff nurses are integral to detecting and treating these symptoms. Pain, dyspnea, and anxiety should be routinely assessed by patient self-report when possible. Routine behavioral screening for delirium is recommended. Behavioral observation tools to detect pain and dyspnea and proxy assessments guide symptom identification when the patient cannot provide a self-report. Evidence-based interventions are offered for both prevention and treatment of pain, dyspnea, anxiety, and delirium. Death rattle does not produce patient distress, and current pharmacological treatment lacks an evidence base. Pain management has a robust evidence base compared to management of dyspnea, anxiety, and delirium among this population; well-designed, adequately powered studies are needed.",0
431,"Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate intervention fidelity of nurses' delivery of the RAPIT recovery program for postintensive care patients. Background: Interventions addressing patient problems after intensive care lack description of the process of delivery and the evidence of their effectiveness. This is needed to understand how these interventions work. Design: Multistage intervention framework in a mixed‐methods design. Intervention fidelity strategies were assessed for intervention design, training, delivery, receipt, and enactment with quantitative and qualitative methods inspired by the Medical Research Council and the National Institutes of Health Fidelity Framework. Methods: Data collection was embedded in a multicenter randomized controlled trial to explore intervention fidelity of a recovery program (December 2012–February 2017). Ten Danish intensive care units participated in the RAPIT‐trial including 386 patients and 27 nurses. Quantitative data covered training and delivery. Qualitative data explored design, quality of delivery, receipt, and enactment seen from nurses' and patients' perspectives. Data were analysed statistically and by systematic deductive‐inductive thematic analysis. Findings: A framework for participatory enactment of a complex intervention was developed and demonstrated delivery with high consistent fidelity across sites. Low delivery doses and variations were related to the program, patient, provider nurses and context. Conclusion: Our study provides insight into the process of intervention fidelity of a nurse‐led postintensive care recovery program and potentially enables professionals to understand key factors in cross‐site implementation. Although we demonstrate consistent delivery and variations suggest that some patients may benefit more than others.",0
432,"Summary: Delirium is a significant problem for older hospitalized people and is associated with poor outcomes. It is poorly recognized and evidence suggests that a major reason is lack of education. Nurses, who are educated about delirium, can play a significant role in improving delirium recognition. This study evaluated the impact of a delirium specific educational website. A cluster randomized controlled trial, with a pretest/post-test time series design, was conducted to measure delirium knowledge (DK) and delirium recognition (DR) over three time-points. Statistically significant differences were found between the intervention and non-intervention group. The intervention groups' DK scores were higher and the change over time results were statistically significant [T3 and T1 (t=3.78 p=<0.001) and T2 and T1 baseline (t=5.83 p=<0.001)]. Statistically significant improvements were also seen for DR when comparing T2 and T1 results (t=2.56 p=0.011) between both groups but not for changes in DR scores between T3 and T1 (t=1.80 p=0.074). Participants rated the website highly on the visual, functional and content elements. This study supports the concept that web-based delirium learning is an effective and satisfying method of information delivery for registered nurses. Future research is required to investigate clinical outcomes as a result of this web-based education.",0
433,"Approximately 10-30% of hospital admissions develop delirium where nearly 30-40% of the delirium cases are preventable. Non-detection rates by acute care healthcare workers were reported at 72-75%. Hence, it is crucial for hospitals to develop delirium education programs focused on early recognition and prevention. Thus, the purpose of this mixed method study was to develop and evaluate the effect of a delirium education program (DEP) on improving critical care nurses' knowledge and self-confidence in identifying delirium and the associated risk factors. In the quantitative strand (Phase I) of the study, both the intervention and control groups completed the online pre-tests and posttests consisting of demographic survey, Nurses'Knowledge of Delirium (NKD), and Confidence Scale (C-Scale). The intervention group attended the DEP that included an online education module followed by one-on-one case study/vignettes with role playing. Data analysis of Phase I informed the decisions regarding the sampling for the qualitative strand (Phase II). The quantitative data were analyzed utilizing a mixed model Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to test whether there were significant effects of the between group subject factor (group membership: intervention vs control), within group subject Time factor (pre-intervention vs post-intervention scores), and the Group by Time interaction. For Phase II, audio-taped phone interviews were conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of the nurses related to DEP. Dataset of the qualitative strand was then embedded into the quantitative dataset to come up with the final results of the study.",0
434,"Objective: Learn perception, opinion and knowledge of nursing about assessment and management of analgesia, sedation and delirium. Raise awareness of the importance of their involvement. Consolidate and update knowledge. Methods: Observational analytic cross-sectional study performed in critical care, abril-noviembre 2011. Nine training sessions were conducted, delivering before-after test of knowledge and attitude questionnaire. Significance p <0,05. Results: Questionnaire was given to 143 nurses, 33(28-40) years old. They knew validated tools to assess sedation, analgesia and delirium 59%, 57% and 2%, not the used 77%, 79% and 100% respectively. The knowledge test scores increased (p<0.001) 3,5 (2,1-4,9): 8,5 (7,8-8,5). Nurses change significantly their answers in 11 questions of perception and 3 of opinion onto the opposite end (p<0.01) and toward the same end in 6 questions of opinion(p<0.001). Conclusions: The dissemination of tools to assess analgesia-sedation is acceptable but their implementation is inadequate. There is a great lack of knowledge on how to assess the delirium. The training provided a view of management of the analgesia-sedation and delirium, increased knowledge and raised about the importance of the involvement of nursing.",0
435,"Patients in hospital intensive care units are at increased risk to develop delirium, a condition which is characterized by a disturbance of consciousness and a change in cognition. Critical care nurses must have the knowledge to assess, recognize, and manage delirium. The purpose of this project was to develop an evidence-based policy for the assessment of delirium and a comprehensive nursing education plan which included an analysis and synthesis of the literature, a curriculum plan, and a pretest/posttest. The Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice Model framed the project, which used a multidisciplinary team approach. Two nursing leaders, each with a doctor of philosophy degree, served as content experts for the educational curriculum plan and the pretest/posttest. The curriculum plan was evaluated using a dichotomous scale of 1 = not met and 2 = met. An average score of 2 was achieved showing the content met the objectives. The pretest/posttest items were validated using a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = not relevant to 4 = very relevant. A content validation index score of 1.0 was computed, revealing that the items met the objectives and content of the curriculum. The pretest/posttest was administered before and after the educational program to determine the knowledge gained. A paired samples t test was conducted and found to have a statistically significant difference in the scores for the pretest (M = 81.25, SD = 11.29) and post-test (M = 94.06, SD = 7.12); t (31) = -5.92, p = 0.01, revealing that the critical care nurses gained significant knowledge with the delirium educational program. This project can promote positive social change because early recognition and management of the patient with delirium can facilitate positive outcomes for patients, families, and systems.",0
436,"Aims and objectives In order to obtain more information regarding this phenomenon, a scoping review of the literature was undertaken to analyse current research on the recognition of delirium by registered nurses in acute care settings. Background Delirium is often manifested as a sign of an underlying undiagnosed condition that requires immediate intervention and is frequently manifested in acute care settings. Unfortunately, registered nurses often do not recognise delirium and its occurrence goes under-reported. Design/Methods Based on six inclusion criteria, a search in numerous databases using terms such as delirium detection, recognition and diagnosis by registered nurses was undertaken. Eight quantitative studies were deemed relevant and analysed for this scoping review. Results Seven major categories emerged: the fluctuating nature of delirium, the impact of delirium education on its recognition, communication barriers, inadequate use of delirium assessment tools, lack of conceptual understanding of delirium, delirium as a burden and the likeness of delirium and dementia. A brief summary of the findings in each category is reported here. Conclusions The scoping review revealed that delirium remains underrecognised by registered nurses, which potentially contributes to reduced quality of nursing care for clients experiencing this condition. Further research on delirium and the processes that registered nurses use to recognise it is timely and will facilitate the development of evidence-based interventions to manage it. Relevance to clinical practice While acute care registered nurses have historically reported dramatic changes in cognitive and neuro-biological functions in ill older adults, the literature highlighted in this scoping review revealed the following: (1) the need for further research to validate delirium assessment tools and, (2) the need for education and training for registered nurses on the use of these assessment tools to promote early recognition and thereby decrease the incidence of delirium in older adults.",0
437,"Objective: to verify the knowledge and practices of a nursing team from an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) regarding the care to elderly patients in order to prevent and monitor delirium episodes. Method: this is an action-research, with a sample of nine nurses and one nurse technician. The data was collected in a pedagogical workshop, and the analysis of content was used. Results: the interviewees demonstrated superficial understanding regarding the events of delirium, which can be observed by moments of excitement, disconnected discourse, hallucinations, and sudden memory loss. They only informed the necessity to take action to bring the patient back to his normal state in order to prevent further events, and the use of antipsychotics/sedatives and immobilization in bed to control the event. Under the practices described, the authors detected a dysfunction exclusively on the clinical signs, which they prevent in re-orientations and in the promotion of sleep, and control the event by physically restraining the patient and by administrating the prescribed medication. Conclusion: the participants demonstrated an incipient understanding on the topic, which reflects directly in the practices performed to prevent and monitor the delirium in the studied location.",0
438,"The article reports on a study that re-examines the state of nurses' attitudes about sedation of patients obtaining mechanical ventilation. Highlights include the negative effects of sedation according to multiple studies, link between current sedation practice and post-traumatic stress disorder and post-intensive care syndrome, and the need to keep nurses as full partners in developing future sedation guidelines.",0
439,"Purpose/goals: The purpose of this presentation is to provide critical care nurses with a basic level of knowledge for recognizing and managing the signs and symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal in an adult inpatient population. Additionally, this presentation will provide nurses with an improved understanding of substance use disorder, concurrent disorders, harm reduction opportunities, and advocacy points for individuals negatively impacted by systemic or socioeconomic disadvantages. Outcome 1: To become familiarized with the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) and its application for critical care inpatients. Outcome 2: To develop a deeper understanding of social factors that contribute to poor coping mechanisms, including substance use disorders. Outcome 3: To gain a base level of knowledge on harm reduction opportunities including take home naloxone, safer injecting practices, and overdose prevention. Session description: The fallout of the current Canadian opiate crisis extends beyond city streets and places a tremendous strain on emergency departments, ICUs, and inpatient hospital units. Individuals using opiates may be admitted into these areas with overdose, or for any of several other reasons while maintaining an underlying opiate use disorder. It is vital for critical care nurses to be aware of the signs of opiate withdrawal, as patients may be unable to express their substance use histories or discomfort due to neurological incapacitation or intubation. The symptoms of opiate withdrawal dramatically impact individuals' experiences and add to trauma and delirium experienced in hospital stays. Critical care nurses would benefit from a greater understanding of opioid use disorder (OUD), clinical manifestations of, and management for opiate withdrawal, and patient advocacy opportunities for this community. The presentation will use case studies and engage participants in open discussion to examine the standardized assessment tool for recognizing opiate withdrawal, opiate agonist therapy and other pharmaceutical intervention options, as well as discussion of the impact of trauma and concurrent mental health disorders that influence individuals' use of illicit substances. The presentation will also provide education on harm reduction opportunities including safer injection teaching, overdose prevention strategies, and take-home naloxone kits.",0
440,"Purpose/goals: The purpose of this session is to review an innovative and comprehensive mobilization assessment framework that utilizes novel strategies to ensure critical care patients receive proactive cognitive and physical mobilization interventions in the context of delirium management. Outcome 1: To identify strategies to overcome barriers to mobilization in the context of critical care. Outcome 2: To outline the creation of mobilization assessment tool and discuss strategies for integration and implementation. Outcome 3: To describe “brain mobility”—An innovative approach to cognitive mobilization. Session description: In the quest to understand barriers to early mobilization, a need to create a comprehensive mobilization assessment and measurement framework was identified. Through examination of literature, it is identified that mobilization is often neglected or delayed due to frontline provider lack of knowledge and comfort in initiating mobilization, resulting in increased ventilator days and hospital stay (Cameron, et al., 2015, Schaller, et al., 2016). This session discusses the evolutionary process from creation to provincial implementation of the Readiness to Mobilize Tool. This tool is aimed at empowering frontline staff to assess a patient's readiness efficiently and safely to mobilize and provides guidelines for appropriate mobilization strategies. This engaging session will also provide an innovative look at the integration of both cognitive and physical mobility strategies that provide a patient and family-centred approach. Critical care nurses will leave with strategies that will enable them to be the one to advocate for early mobilization.",0
441,"Today, more critically ill patients are surviving and leaving the intensive care unit (ICU). However, patients with a critical illness can experience a myriad of complications. They are at risk for complications such as physical deconditioning with profound muscle weakness, delirium and skin breakdown. Recognizing the impact on long-term outcomes requires a culture shift in health care teams. No longer are we just “keeping alive”; we are helping patients get back the life they want. The evidence supports that early mobility reduces ICU-acquired weakness, decreases the incidence of ventilator-associated pneum onia, and reduces skin com plications. Furtherm ore, early mobilization of adult ICU patients is the intervention m ost strongly recom m ended to reduce the incidence and duration of one of the most deleterious effects of critical illness-d eliriu m . Delirium is estimated to occur in up to 80% of adult ventilated patients. It is associated with prolonged ICU and hospital lengths of stay and the development of post-ICU cognitive impairment. The impact on patients and families is profound. In this presentation, we will share our experience of shifting our culture from “keeping alive” to optim izing long-term outcom es by im plem enting an early m obility program in tw o o f our ICUs. The processes u n d ertak en and p ro to col developed will be shared. Recognizing the im portance of frontline know ledge and capacity, the im plem entation phase and evaluation of our early m obility program has been led by a team of frontline nurses and physiotherapists.

444,"Surgery unit nurses often deal with older people in an acute confusional state (ACS). To care for them, nurses must resort to different patterns of knowing, including empirical, esthetic, ethical, personal and emancipatory. According to Chinn and Kramer (2008), it is by consciously and deliberately asking themselves critical questions about specific clinical situations that nurses can enhance their knowledge and improve practice. In this regard, narrative pedagogy developed by Diekelmann (2001), which encourages sharing lived experiences and seeking other possibilities for the future, seems a well suited approach. This article presents the theoretical bases of narrative pedagogy and the grounds for an intervention inspired by this approach and intended for nurses who must care for hospitalized older people in an ACS. This innovative pedagogical intervention, which encourages nurses to participate actively in their learning, is consistent with recent empirical works on continuing education of health professionals.",0
445,"This article describes an experience of providing nursing care to an eighty year-old patient with urinary tract infection (UTI). The author cared for this patient in the role of clinical geriatric nurse specialist from May 11 to 23 in 2005. Through comprehensive assessment, careful review of medical records, contact with family and nursing home healthcare workers, it was determined that the patient' s cognition and physical function declines were due to delirium resulting from the last time the patient had been hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). In order to prevent incidents of delirium, three nursing goals were set: controlling infection, avoidance of delirium recurrence, and recovery of prior levels of physical function and self-care ability. Nursing interventions used included UTI control, tube and catheter removal as early as possible, control of environmental factors, and muscle strength and exercise training. After two weeks of care, the patient could take food orally and the nasogastric (NG) tube had been successfully removed. Physical function and self-care ability improved from 'dependent' to 'partial assistance'. Although UTI was controlled, removal of the foley tube failed due to prostate hypertrophy. No delirious event occurred during hospitalization and cognitive functions improved. From this experience, early assessment and intervention should be conducted for high-risk elderly patients in order to prevent delirious events and declines in cognitive and physical functions. The author hopes this case report will prove a useful reference to nurses charged with caring for elderly patients at risk for delirium.",0
446,"The delirium is frequently present in critical patients in intensive care unit. Although it is associated with a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality, the health team is still having difficulties in recognizing it. Delirium is a physical disorder with disturbed consciousness, attention, cognition, and perception, and the prevalence may ranges 10-40% of patients admitted to hospital. In view of that, we carried out a literature review concerning aspects related to the etiology, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome. The risk factors include acute systemic diseases, advanced age, preexisting cognitive disorders, sleeping deprivation and use of certain medications. The non- pharmacological measures and pharmacology are the base of the treatment. Therefore, we suggest a detailed study about this theme, taking into account little studies on the matter. We emphasize the nursing importance, that must be capable of identify patients oscillatory behavior and intervene rapidly.",0
448,"Nurses with critical care knowledge and experience increasingly provide technologically advanced care to patients at home who often present comorbid psychiatric symptoms. Failure to accurately recognize and provide appropriate intervention can be devastating for patients because these symptoms can exacerbate the medical condition and may lead to mortality. The Biopsychosocial Model and the Transactional Model of Stress were presented as guides for nursing practice. Practice is directed at 1) understanding the patient's perception of events, 2) involving the caregiver(s) in the patient's recovery, and 3) enhancing the individual's adaptive coping efforts and resources. The article attempts to guide nurses in making decisions on when to consult and collaborate with an APPN to achieve desired patient outcomes. Copyright (c) 1998 by W.B. Saunders Company",0
449,"Background: Critically ill patients who develop delirium experience longer stays in intensive care as well as increased morbidity and mortality. Assessing a patient's level of delirium also requires assessment of the level of consciousness, since changes in the latter are signs of delirium. The aim of this questionnaire was to highlight clinical practice in respect of assessing sedation and symptoms of delirium in intensive care patients. Based on the results received, various tools for assessing sedation are discussed. Method: In May 2009 the questionnaire was issued via email to 46 intensive care units caring for ventilated adult patients. An intensive care nurse with daily patient contact was asked to describe the unit's practice in respect of sedation and delirium assessment tools in adult patients. Results: The questionnaires show that patients' level of sedation is almost always assessed on Danish intensive care units. There was no consensus on which tool was used to assess sedation, the frequency of assessment, or on which patient groups such tools are used. The field is clinically relevant since recent studies suggest that sedation, and in particular over-sedation, has a number of adverse effects. Assessment of delirium is performed rarely, and rarely systematically. Only five units assessed patients systematically using CAM-ICU. Less than half of the units have a protocol for treatment of delirium.",0
454,"The number of elderly, both in society at large and in the critical care population, is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Critical care nurses must address how best to provide care to these elders. The authors focus on physiologic, cognitive, and psychosocial characteristics of the elderly that place them at risk for complications during their stay in critical care. The critical care environment also contributes to complications such as sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation or overload, painful procedures, and decreased social support. The critical care environment may also be a factor in facilitating delirium, common in critically ill elders. Critical care nurses can proactively help to create a healing environment for these elders by facilitating sleep, implementing strategies to reduce delirium, preventing or minimizing painful experiences, and liberalizing family visitations.",0
455,"Background: delirium, defined as acute cerebral insufficiency and as acute confusional state, has a strong impact and an high incidence in intensive care units; it has been calculated that 87% of hospitalized patients in ICU develop delirium. Therefore, it is a serious condition associated with negative outcomes. Delirium treatment is based on the combination of two types of approaches: the pharmacological approach and the nonpharmacological one. Objective: to investigate non-pharmacological strategies and approaches to delirium prevention and management. Materials and methods: literature review on non-pharmacological approaches through a research in PubMed and CINAHL databases; 28 articles were selected. The research was also carried out in the gray literature. Results: delirium is significantly underdiagnosed and undermanaged, because it is often considered as a normal and expected condition in critically ill patients. Delirium is not considered a priority among the conditions that may occur in critically ill patients and therefore it results underassessed. The difficulties are mainly related to the interpretation of sedated and intubated patients and the assessment recording of patients with delirium. Reorientation, environmental interventions and family members involvement are the main non-pharmacological approaches used. Conclusions: nurses have a key role in the recognition and management of patients with delirium, especially in the application of non-pharmacological and multicomponent approaches. Prevention remains the mainstay of treatment. It's necessary to implement specific educational interventions to increase knowledge about delirium and to create validated instruments, such as structured and evidence-based protocols, to encourage the integration of delirium investigation in routine clinical practice.",0
456,"Key Points: Question: Do intensive care units in the United States provide high-quality end-of-life care? Findings: In this cohort study of 1536 decedents within a national quality improvement collaborative, end-of-life care delivery varied widely between intensive care units. There were 3 mutually exclusive unit-level patterns of end-of-life care delivery observed, which suggest meaningful differences in the experience of dying for patients cared for in higher-performing and lower-performing units. Meaning: To improve care for all patients who die in an intensive care unit, future research should target unit-level variation and investigate the latent characteristics of high-performing units that promote high-quality end-of-life care. This cohort study describes the structures, processes, and variability of end-of-life care delivered in intensive care units in the United States. Importance: Overall, 1 of 5 decedents in the United States is admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) before death. Objective: To describe structures, processes, and variability of end-of-life care delivered in ICUs in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationwide cohort study used data on 16 945 adults who were cared for in ICUs that participated in the 68-unit ICU Liberation Collaborative quality improvement project from January 2015 through April 2017. Data were analyzed between August 2018 and June 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Published quality measures and end-of-life events, organized by key domains of end-of-life care in the ICU. Results: Of 16 945 eligible patients in the collaborative, 1536 (9.1%) died during their initial ICU stay. Of decedents, 654 (42.6%) were women, 1037 (67.5%) were 60 years or older, and 1088 (70.8%) were identified as white individuals. Wide unit-level variation in end-of-life care delivery was found. For example, the median unit-stratified rate of cardiopulmonary resuscitation avoidance in the last hour of life was 89.5% (interquartile range, 83.3%-96.1%; range, 50.0%-100%). Median rates of patients who were pain free and delirium free in last 24 hours of life were 75.1% (interquartile range, 66.0%-85.7%; range, 0-100%) and 60.0% (interquartile range, 43.7%-85.2%; range, 9.1%-100%), respectively. Ascertainment of an advance directive was associated with lower odds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the last hour of life (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.49-0.99; P =.04), and a documented offer or delivery of spiritual support was associated with higher odds of family presence at the time of death (odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.37-2.77; P <.001). Death in a unit with an open visitation policy was associated with higher odds of pain in the last 24 hours of life (odds ratio, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.15-4.27; P =.02). Unsupervised cluster analysis revealed 3 mutually exclusive unit-level patterns of end-of-life care delivery among 63 ICUs with complete data. Cluster 1 units (14 units [22.2%]) had the lowest rate of cardiopulmonary resuscitation avoidance but achieved the highest pain-free rate. Cluster 2 (25 units [39.7%]) had the lowest delirium-free rate but achieved high rates of all other end-of-life events. Cluster 3 (24 units [38.1%]) achieved high rates across all favorable end-of-life events. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, end-of-life care delivery varied substantially among ICUs in the United States, and the patterns of care observed suggest that units can be characterized as higher and lower performing. To achieve optimal care for patients who die in an ICU, future research should target unit-level variation and disseminate the successes of higher-performing units.",0
457,"The author describes how a team of nurses, called the Delirium Care Group, at Saint George's University Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust in England raised awareness of delirium and introduced a screening tool on their intensive care unit (ICU). She offers an overview of the study the team conducted to improve patient experience and ensure safe and quality health care. Steps take to assess patient compliance through staff feedback and audit are outlined.",0
458,"Description/background: Early detection and intervention in cases of potential clinical deterioration are important to guide treatment and prevent significant adverse advents. However, the frequency and timing of assessments remains a matter of custom and opinion. Evidence indicates that sleep disruption has measurable and often persistent harmful effects, particularly in elderly patients. Finding the best balance between safety and undisturbed rest has important implications for nursing practice. The purpose of this study was to review adverse events such as arrests and rapid response calls to determine the interval between the event and the last previous vital signs recorded. Review of Literature: Flynn noted that ""nurses need to stop using practice interventions that are based solely on tradition."" Timely and appropriate clinical observation of patients is a cornerstone of nursing practice. Observation serves to detect adverse changes, to guide and evaluate care, and to provide comfort and reassurance. Nurses play a vital role in the evolution of health care based upon evidence-based practices rather than tradition. Patients on transitional care units often have multiple and complex health problems which put them at increased risk of such occurrences. However, the frequency and timing of assessments remains a matter of custom and opinion with few supporting studies to provide substantiation. While any patient has the potential to experience a sudden change in condition, certain characteristics often present in the transitional care patient population are associated with greater instability: newly admitted, recently transferred (from higher or lower level of care), or a recent procedure (Schulman and Staul 2010). Others in the patient population on TCU, such as those improving and close to discharge, have a decreased risk of sudden adverse event. Several studies have examined the value of MEWS (modified early warning score) values in predicting these events. Churpak et al, in a study reviewing 88 cardiac arrests, found significantly higher scores in the 48 hours preceding the event. Meester et al reviewed more than 500 patient records at Antwerp University hospital and concluded there was a significant difference in mean MEWS scores in patients experiencing a serious adverse event compared to patients without such an event. Ludikhuize et al reviewed 204 cases in Amsterdam, noting that 80% of cases had an increased MEWS score during the 48 hours before a serious adverse event. Yoder et al noted that patients with lower risk as determined by MEWS score had significantly fewer adverse events, but were awakened at night just as often as higher-risk patients. Determining how often assessment should be performed at night is a topic of particular concern, given the increasing evidence that sleep disruption has measurable and often persistent harmful effects. Several studies have confirmed measurable physiological effects related to interrupted sleep. Older adults whose amount of daytime sleep increased in the six months following return home from a rehabilitation facility were found to have worsening cognitive function, while those with less daytime sleep demonstrated improved function (Dzierzewski). Sleep disruption has been associated with impaired physical and cognitive function, fatigue, and exacerbation of symptoms. (Flynn). Watson et al noted that sleep deprivation has been associated with a number of physiological disruptions including immune response, cardiac regulation, metabolic and endocrine regulation, and pain response. He also cites studies indicating that interrupted or insufficient sleep is associated with delirium in ICU patients, and that sleep-promoting medications may contribute to the development of delirium. Scientific evidence supports the fact that frequent interruptions can result in sleep deprivation to such an extent that the patient's health and recovery are adversely affected. Action: A retrospective descriptive study was used to examine the frequency and type of significant adverse events occurring on the night shift on five transitional care units for one year. Data included the type, cause and outcome of event and last previous vital signs assessment. Outcomes and Takeaways: Forty-six codes and one hundred sixty-eight rapid response events occurred. The rate of events declined over the length of time since last assessment. It was determined that 38% of events occurred within one hour of the previous assessment, and 85% within less than the four-hour interval for performing a scheduled assessment. The findings indicate that sudden unexpected clinical deterioration is uncommon in this constantly monitored patient population. Patients, particularly older clients, are vulnerable to harmful effects from interrupted sleep. Guidelines to lengthen the permitted interval between nighttime assessments, along with a coordinated effort to combine necessary sleep interruptions, would minimize these effects.",0
459,"The proposal of this study was to design an instrument of individualized nursing care in intensive care unit (CEIUCI) so as to characterize the interventions of care, in adults with artificial respiration at risk of delirium in uci. Methodology: Observational exploration with 156 nurses working in UCI with adult patients under artificial respiration. A total of 85 items are identified so as to initiate the test. For facial validation, it requires an Aiken index above 0,70. For the content validity, a modified Lawshe equal or superior to 0,58 was calculated. For the construct validation, a factorial analysis with eight NANDA domains was used. Results: The instrument CEI-UCI had facial validity between 0,75 and 0,82 and CVI between 0,58 and 0,90. The construct validity was confirmed by a total variance of the 73% for four factors. The reliability by means of test-retest among the first three days in uci came with a range from 0,662 to 1,00. Conclusions: The psychometric instrument CEI-UCI has obvious facial validity, content validity and constructs validity. This is supported by the factorial analysis showing multi-dimensionalility with four factors: F1, Protection and security (17 items); F2, Physiological and social interactions (3 items); F3, Roles and social connections (13 items) and F4, Self-perceptions and nutrition (11 items). Furthermore, there were united permanent domains: the Perceptual-Cognitive and the Comfort with items derived from care rather than the factorial analysis. The product was the instrument CEI-UCI with 53 items for adults under artificial respiration and monitored for delirium using acceptable psychometric tests.",0
460,"Purpose/goals: Review the incidence and pathophysiology of delirium in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Discuss the research literature in relation to the use of dexmedetomidine in the management of ICU delirium and provide recommendations for ICU registered nurses (RNs). Session description: Despite vigorous efforts to encourage the use of screening tools and adoption of prevention strategies, delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) continues to affect 30% of patients. The success of the pharmacological treatment of delirium remains equivocal; moreover, there is a paucity of research that supports the use of antipsychotic drugs. However, dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha2 adrenoreceptor agonist, at least appears to have a promising role in the management of delirium. A brief review of delirium will be provided including the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and predisposing factors. The current management, complications, and long-term consequences of delirium are presented. This presentation will provide a critical appraisal of the research findings in relation to the use of dexmedetomidine in ICU management of delirium. The implications for critical care RNs in relation to nursing care and education will be provided. The critical care nurses will be invited to participate in informal audience polling to determine their familiarity and experience with the use of dexmedetomidine. Learning outcomes: 1. Have a comprehensive understanding of the administration, monitoring and discontinuation of dexmedetomidine infusions. 2. Understand the literature on dexmedetomidines use in the management of delirium.",0
461,"The primary purpose of this study was to explore the current use, metadata and availability of delirium data elements in an electronic health record (EHR) and clinical data repository (CDR). The investigation explored the domain-specific ontology of ICU delirium by comparing the delirium data elements representing nursing practice at one clinical agency with a Synthesis of evidence-based practice recommendations for adult patients at risk for delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) developed for the Knowledge-Based Nursing Initiative (KBNI). The analysis provided a detailed understanding of the representation of data elements in one clinical setting and the availability of data for re-use in a clinical decision support system (CDSS). The KBNI conceptual framework guided the study methodology.The descriptive and exploratory study used retrospective analysis of secondary data. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were be used to describe data elements identified through queries of the clinical agency's EHR and CDR. Content analysis was used to categorize the instance-level data from the convenience sample of 1,714 patients.Forty-one data element categories were derived from the Synthesis based on nursing process components. These categories were matched to 160 data elements identified in the clinical agency's EHR. The matched data elements were primarily text-based, entered by registered nurses using flow sheets and care planning documentation. Although all but two data elements from the Synthesis were initially matched to data elements at the clinical agency, there was low use and availability for many of these data elements. ICD-9 codes were the only standardized terminology identified and had low data availability. Crossover element matches were found for many of the data elements which could create integration challenges when selecting the best data elements for reuse.The findings of the study supported the importance of representing nursing practice electronically in a standardized manner in order to meet information needs of nurses. Future research is needed to identify level of risk for delirium and to determine the best preventative interventions. Policy implications of the study include a need to continue the inclusion of nursing quality measures, EHR interoperability and utilization of standardized nursing terminologies.",0

465,"The intensive care unit syndrome (ICU syndrome) is defined as an altered emotional state occurring in a highly stressful environment, which may manifest itself in various forms such as delirium, confusion, crazy dreams or unreal experiences. The purpose of this part of a study of patients' experiences is to describe and illuminate patients' experiences of acute confusion, disorientation, wakefulness, dreams and nightmares during and after their stay in the ICU. The data were obtained from 19 ventilated patients, who were interviewed twice and had stayed at least 36 hours in the ICU, the first interview being about one week after discharge from the ICU, and the second 4-8 weeks later. The hermeneutic approach used when interpreting and analysing the text from the interviews revealed that patients' experiences of unreal experiences were often associated with intense fear. Intense or continuous unbearable fear seems to result in frightening unreal experiences, which further increase the level of fear. Care actions or caring relationships with relatives or nurses can reduce this fear, which can help to prevent the occurrence and/or duration and intensity of the unreal experiences. Trust and confidence in nurses or significant others and feelings of self-control or trust in self-control seemed to reduce the risk of unreal experiences so that adverse stimuli might only trigger a mild confusion.",0
466,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this process improvement project was to develop an Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS) management protocol for acute care. SIGNIFICANCE: The prevalence of alcohol abuse in our society presents challenges for health professionals, and few nurses have received formal education on the identification and treatment of AWS, which has frequently resulted in ineffective, nonstandardized care. However, nurses practicing in medical-surgical, emergency, trauma, and critical care settings must be astute in the assessment and management of AWS. DESIGN/BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: Following an analysis of existing management protocols, a behavioral health clinical nurse specialist was asked to lead a work team composed of physicians, pharmacists, and nurses to develop a new evidence-based alcohol withdrawal protocol for acute care. METHODS/DESCRIPTION: By implementing a standardized assessment tool and treatment protocol, clinical nurse specialists empowered nursing staff with strategies to prevent the serious medical complications associated with AWS. FINDINGS/OUTCOMES: The development and integration of a safe and effective treatment protocol to manage AWS was facilitated by collaborative, evidence-based decision making. CONCLUSION: Clinical experience and specialty expertise were integrated by clinical nurse specialists skilled in group dynamics, problem-solving, and the implementation of change. Improving care of patients in AWS is an exemplar for clinical nurse specialist roles as change agent and patient advocate.",0
467,"Delirium is a common, disruptive, costly, and at times lethal condition found among patients in the acute care setting. Nurses can be the first to discover its presence and thereby reduce the time to treatment. Identifying delirium requires a knowledge of its clinical features, a mastery of the bedside cognitive mental status examination, critical judgment in distinguishing delirium from other psychiatric disorders, and appropriate nursing interventions based on ongoing assessment. In this article we review elements of such an approach and illustrate common clinical challenges for nurses with case examples.",0
468,"Delirium is the most frequent complication of hospitalized older adults, and is most prevalent in intensive care units. Negative sequelae of delirium in older adults include increased mortality rates, length of stay, cognitive impairment, functional decline, and decreased quality of life. Nurses are in a position to recognize and manage delirium in patients, yet research has indicated that nurses are neither identifying, nor managing delirium in these patients. The purpose of this study was to explore critical care nurses' recognition of delirium, beliefs and perceived barriers to the assessment and management of delirium, and to ascertain if ageism towards the older adult is a barrier to delirium recognition and management in the older adult.We used a qualitative descriptive design with methodology informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior to elicit 30 intensive care unit nurses' responses to delirium vignettes in order to elicit behavioral, normative, and control beliefs. The vignettes reflect the 3 subtypes of delirium: hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed. Information on recognition of delirium, intention to act, and prioritization of action were obtained. We used descriptive and content analysis to address the purposes of the study.Nurses recognized assessment findings associated with delirium but did not use the term 'delirium'. The majority of nurses prioritized management of the young adult patient with the mixed subtype of delirium compared to 20% who prioritized the older adult with the same scenario and expressed ageist beliefs towards the older adult, though reportedly it would not impede delirium recognition and management. The majority of nurses made the management of the older adult with hypoactive delirium their lowest priority. Nurses believed that delirium assessment and recognition is important and mainly their role. Nurses reported issues that hinder their ability to assess for and act on delirium include time, staffing, and support. In addition to altering those factors, while further nursing education is needed, incorporating a delirium assessment tool into their usual charting, and having a delirium policy and protocol in place would enable nurses' delirium assessment and management.This dissertation is comprised of one original research study, written as two publishable papers. The two manuscripts are presented in this thesis, including references and tables. The first is a methods paper on the use of vignettes in research with original research as an exemplar, while the second is a paper on the delirium research and results.

470,"Background: Delirium is common, costly, and leads to adverse consequences in hospitalized older adults. Pre-existing dementia is the most common risk factor for the development of delirium. Despite multidimensional interventions aimed at improving outcomes, delirium superimposed on dementia remains poorly detected and recognized by formal healthcare providers. Informal caregivers are proposed as a viable solution to improve detection and recognition in this vulnerable population.Purpose: The purpose of this study is to systematically assess informal caregiver recognition, detection, and reporting of symptoms of delirium in hospitalized older adults with pre existing dementia.Methods: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected in this descriptive, exploratory work from 38 informal caregiver and patient dyads. This study was embedded within a National Institutes of Nursing Research funded cluster, randomized controlled clinical trial, Early Nurse Detection of Delirium Superimposed on Dementia (END DSD). In addition to data collected within this study, an additional informal caregiver post hospitalization telephone interview was conducted (N=23).Results: Although there was poor agreement between researcher and informal caregiver ratings of full and subsyndromal delirium, there was 100% agreement on delirium features of acute change and inattention. These are two hallmark features of delirium. Results from the qualitative data explore the acute care experience for informal caregivers of persons with pre-existing dementia and suggest that delirium occurs and persists across transitions of care.Conclusion: Informal caregivers appear to be a source of information in the acute care setting to improve detection and recognition of delirium superimposed on dementia. This group needs to be considered in research and practice as a critical component of the transdisciplinary healthcare team.",0
471,"Introduction: In 2015 the Region Lombardy counted 111.784 hospitalization days in Intensive Care Units. . In most cases the mobilization of patients with tracheal tube was not performed. On the basis of scientific evidences the immobilization is widely known as one of the causes of the increase in mortality and complications, such as injuries and adverse events related to drugs, nosocomial infections and falls. Aims: to investigate and analyse: patient selection criteria for early mobilization; types of mobilization that can be performed ; barriers and limitations to mobilization; costs and sustainability ; attitudes and perceptions of nurses. Materials and methods: using PICO format, the search was performed in the following databases: Scopus, Cinahl, Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase. Search terms (free terms, MeSH): early, mobilization, ambulation, intensive care unit, adult. Inclusion criteria: age >18; publications dates: from 2012 to 2016. Exclusion criteria: presence of a specific pathology, absence of mechanic ventilation. Quality appraisal: Dixon and Woods. Analysis and discussion: the types of mobilization, passive, active or a combination of both are associated with: decrease in hospitalization days, shorter duration of delirium, fewer days of dependence on invasive mechanic ventilation, increased walking distance during deambulation and better functional status at the moment of discharge. Conclusions: The benefits derived from the interventions of mobilization are multiple for both the functional recovery in the acute phase and for the patient's quality of life after the discharge. Nurses have a crucial role in safe mobilization of patients.",0
472,"This review demonstrates essential issues to consider when caring for older trauma patients, including baseline physical status, mental health, comorbidities, and risk factors for sequelae and future injuries. The impact of a traumatic injury on older adults is complex. Issues of normal aging, functional status, chronic health conditions, and response to treatment affect health care and related decisions. Studies that have examined outcomes for older trauma patients to date have been mainly descriptive or confined to a single institution, limiting our ability to generalize. Other studies, using large data sets, have provided some information regarding possible primary prevention strategies, yet have limitations in the individual level detail collected. Nevertheless, this review also demonstrates the dearth of available evidence-based recommendations that provides support to treatment protocols in this complex and diverse patient population. The lack of an evidence base to use in the management of older trauma patients demonstrates the critical need for research in this rapidly growing population. An example of one such area includes the use of pulmonary artery catheters in older trauma patients. Although evidence to date suggests that pulmonary artery catheters are of benefit in the management of patients with physiologic compromise, it is unclear whether using these published cardiac output management recommendations leads to improved outcomes. In light of newly published data suggesting equivocal benefit from use of pulmonary artery catheters, with increased side effects, this controversy is an important area for future research. Critical care nurses, with their emphasis on multidisciplinary, holistic practice, can expand their influence as essential members of the interdisciplinary team caring for older trauma patients by cultivating geriatric specialty knowledge. Older trauma patients would benefit greatly from this type of specialty nursing care during all phases of the recovery trajectory, particularly in terms of adequate symptom management and prevention of sequelae, as well as with timely and appropriate initiation of consultative services. Using the intersection of primary and secondary prevention as the overall guide for practice, critical care nurses and other health care providers who possess an understanding of aging processes and comorbid conditions can significantly improve outcomes for older adults with traumatic injuries.

Although this procedure was not used in the United States until 2011, it has gained popularity as the preferred alternative treatment and is believed to become the preferred standard treatment in the near future. Since TAVR is still new and postoperative care is crucial in the patient outcomes, it is important and necessary for nurses to have the comprehensive knowledge of the treatment, its postoperative complications, and available nursing interventions for the postoperative care.

Physical restraints have not been shown to be effective at prevention of unplanned extubation; however, lower nurse-to-patient ratios and quality improvement programs for data tracking and staff education are recommended.

Results: It is believed several factors may play an important role in cause and effect of cognitive impairment after critical illness. Such factors discussed include: inadequate brain oxygenation, delirium, sedation, systemic inflammatory response, glucose dysregulation, medications, and specific illnesses, which may have direct effects on the brain. Physical and cognitive exercises, social support networks, early psychological evaluation and treatm ent, prom oting personal well-being, encouraging independence with ADLs, and educating and supporting patients' families on their role in critical illness have all proven to aid in healthy cognitive outcomes (Brummel et al., 2012; Davidson et al., 2013; Hopkins, 2013). Conclusion: There are a m yriad of obstacles critically ill patients and their families' face that can start acutely and end chronically. Cognitive decline is only one of many of these obstacles. It is a bedside clinician's role to care for the patient to improve both acute and chronic health outcomes by incorporating daily evaluation and screening, and implementing proven cognitive activities. Further research of post-discharge cognitive outcomes and their impact on patient well-being can allow clinicians to recognize these issues earlier on and m itigate potential destruction of a patient's cognition to improve healthy outcomes for the future.",0

482,"Aim: This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the attitude, practice, and knowledge among the nurses about the delirium in a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: The study included 138 nurses working in a tertiary care multispecialty hospital in North India. The knowledge and attitude toward delirium were assessed by using a self-designed questionnaire (33 questions), of which 26 items specifically evaluated the knowledge and attitude toward various aspects of delirium. Results: The majority of the participants were females (83.3%), had done graduation (92.8%) in nursing, were junior nursing staff, and were directly in contact with the patient's care. The study shows that the majority of the nurses have poor knowledge about the etiology, prevalence, symptoms, and not aware of the screen procedure and instruments for delirium. Further, they lacked knowledge about the pharmacological and nonpharmacological management of delirium. A majority (83.3%) of the nurses opined that the psychiatry ward is the best place to manage patients with delirium. The majority of the nurses routinely did not screen their patients with delirium and did not know the screening instruments (84.4%) available for delirium. A majority (92.8%) of the nurses opined that they were never trained specifically to assess and manage delirium, and 98.6% expressed willingness for training. Conclusion: This study suggests that nurses working in intensive care unit and emergency settings in a tertiary care hospital in India have poor knowledge, negative attitudes, and poor practices about delirium.",0
483,"Background: Delirium continues to be prevalent. Hence, ICU nurses are facing daunting challenges in providing timely and accurate delirium assessment. Aim: This study aimed to determine the barriers, perceptions, and delirium assessment practices of ICU nurses and explore which of selected participants' characteristics, assessment practices, delirium education, barriers, and perceptions are significantly associated with ICU nurses' frequency of assessing patients with delirium during an average 12 hours shift. Materials and Methods: This study is participated by 136 ICU nurses from two public tertiary hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Descriptive cross-sectional method was used in this survey using self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and Spearman rho were used in analyzing the data. Results: The study has 75.5% response rate. Most of the participants acknowledged presence of ICU sedation protocol specifying frequency in delirium assessment. Delirium is assessed in varying frequencies during 12 hours shift. ICU nurses considered difficulty in interpreting intubated patients, complexity in using delirium assessment tools as top barriers. They preferred using patient's ability to follow commands in assessing delirium over other delirium assessment tools. Almost 40% never received delirium education. Conclusion: There are gaps in delirium assessment practices, perceptions, and education that can be managed. ICU nurses need educational interventions as well as support mechanisms to enhance their confidence and competencies in assessing delirium. Institution-based delirium assessment protocols needed to be revisited and appraised for its appropriateness and applicability in current times and determine if updating is needed.",0
484,"Objective: To assess the medical community's awareness and practice regarding delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: One hundred and ten predesigned questionnaires were distributed to ICU practitioners in the affiliated hospitals of Zhejiang University. Results: A total of 105 valid questionnaires were collected. Totally, 55.3% of the clinicians considered that delirium was common in the ICU. Delirium was believed to be a significant or serious problem by 70.5% of respondents, and under-diagnosis was acknowledged by 56.2% of the respondents. The incidence of ICU delirium is even more under-estimated by the pediatric doctors compared with their counterparts in adult ICU (P<0.05). Primary disease of the brain (agreed by 82.1% of the respondents) was believed to be the most common risk factor for delirium. None of the ICU professionals screened delirium or used a specific tool for delirium assessment routinely. The vast majority (92.4%) of respondents had little knowledge on the diagnosis and the standard treatment of delirium. Conclusions: Although delirium is considered as a serious problem by a majority of the surveyed ICU professionals, it is still under-recognized in routine critical care practice. Data from this survey show a disconnection between the perceived significance of delirium and the current practices of monitoring and treatment in ICU in China.",0
485,"Background Delirium, a disorder of consciousness, often occurs for a period of time during hospitalisation. It is characterised by a disturbance of attention or awareness. Hyperactive delirium may lead to accidental removal of medical equipment, while hypoactive delirium may inhibit patients from participating in nursing interventions, medical treatment, and physical therapy. However, there are limited relevant studies of the strain of care of nurses in China when caring for patients with delirium. This study, thus, aimed to investigate the subjective level of the strain of care experienced by pulmonary and critical care nurses when caring for patients with delirium. Methods This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study. A survey was conducted with 100 nurses in the Chinese pulmonary and critical care medical (PCCM) department in 2018. The Strain of Care for Delirium Index (SCDI) was used to measure nurses' strain of care. Participants were instructed to rate the degree of perceived difficulty in managing patients who displayed the behaviours listed in the SCDI, on a scale from 1 (quite easy) to 4 (very difficult). The mean +/- standard deviation (SD) scores of the ranked difficulty scores were calculated. Results In our sample, 47 % of the nurses had received delirium-related training previously. The three wards with the highest strain of care scores when caring for patients with delirium were the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ward (3.29 +/- 0.72), interstitial lung disease ward (3.11 +/- 1.31), and respiratory intensive care unit (3.02 +/- 0.78). The three types of patient behaviours associated with the highest degree of nursing strain of care were being uncooperative and difficult to manage (3.37 +/- 0.84), pulling out tubes and tearing out dressings (3.33 +/- 0.98), and irritability (3.22 +/- 0.95). Conclusions This study is the first to focus on nurses' subjective strain of care when caring for patients with delirium in PCCM departments in China. The findings suggest the need to pay more attention to the working status of Chinese nurses. Further trials with large samples assessing relevant outcomes of patients with delirium are warranted.",0
486,"Aims. To critically examine the nursing care offered to older people who have been delirious. Background. Delirium occurs as a result of physiological imbalances resulting in an alteration in consciousness and cognitive impairment. Delirium is a prevalent and serious cognitive disorder experienced by older people. While there is a vast number of studies published utilizing quantitative methods, there remains a dearth of research relating to delirium in older people from a qualitative perspective. Design. A qualitative research design that utilized a critical gerontological framework underpinned this study. This framework drew on aspects of postmodernism and Foucault's understanding of discourse. Methods. Data sources included published documents on delirium, semi-structured taped interviews with people over the age of 65 years who had been delirious (as well as their clinical notes), family members, Registered Nurses and a hospital doctor. A postmodern discourse analytic approach was used to interrogate the 20 sets of data collected. Findings. Textual analysis revealed the presence of two major discourses impacting on being an older person with delirium. These were identified as a nursing discourse of delirium and a personal discourse of delirium. A nursing discourse of delirium was largely focussed on the biomedical processes that resulted in a delirious episode. Conversely, a personal discourse of delirium highlights that there are other ways of 'knowing' about delirium through considering the narratives of older adults, and their families, when offering a nursing service to this group of people. Relevance to clinical practice. Nursing needs to critically examine all aspects of nursing care as it applies to older people who have delirium to ensure the rhetorical claims of the profession become the reality for consumers of health services. The use of critical gerontology provides nurses with the tools to challenge the status quo and uncover the multiple, varied, contradictory and complex representations of delirium in older people. Inherent within a personal discourse of delirium is the importance of incorporating into nursing care communicative and other relational activities, such as forming and maintaining a therapeutic relationship.",0

488,"Aim: Early mobilization (EM) improves critical illness survivors' clinical outcomes. This study examines ICU quasi-specialty nurses' EM-related knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). Design: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a provincial ICU specialty nurse training site from 2019 to 2021. KAP data were collected using a self-report questionnaire. Methods: Participants were registered nurses enrolled in the training programme; 485 nurses from 188 hospitals completed the questionnaire. Results: Of the participants, 37.7% had EM training, and 30.7% reported their wards performed EM. Median (IQR) scores for knowledge, attitudes and practices were 14.0 (4.0), 47.0 (9.0) and 37.0 (8.0), belonging to medium, high and medium levels. Scores were lowest for EM scope, implementation indicators and out-of-bed mobilization. There were significant deviations in KAP scores amongst nurses at different levels of hospitals with EM training and whose departments performed EM. Significant positive correlations between knowledge and practice, and attitude and practice were identified.",0
489,"Purpose: The purpose was to explore the experiences of nurses caring for patients with delirium in ICU in China. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 14 ICU nurses in Beijing, China. Audio recordings of the transcripts were coded and analysed thematically. Results: The emergent themes reflected clearly similar experiences and were titled as follows: Internal and external barriers to care; Care burden: workload, psychological pressure and injury; Dilemmas in decision-making: balancing risks and benefits. Conclusions: The results of this qualitative study have provided a rich description of the perceptions of a sample of nurses caring for patients with dementia in Beijing. Clearly, the nurses suffered from their work experiences in several aspects: they lacked the knowledge and skills required assessing and managing the patients as early as possible; they were physically and psychologically stressed while looking after the patients and faced with dilemmas and compromises in their decision-making.

490,"Background: Despite the reported harms and ethical concerns about physical restraint use in the critical care settings, nurses' intention to apply them is unequal across countries. According to the theory of planned behaviour, eliciting nurses' beliefs regarding the use of physical restraints would provide additional social information about nurses' intention to perform this practice. Aim: To explore the salient behavioural, normative and control beliefs underlying the intention of critical care nurses to use physical restraints from the theory of planned behaviour. Research design: A belief elicitation study was conducted. Participants and research context: Twenty-six critical care nurses were purposively sampled across gender, work-shift patterns and professional experience in five intensive care units of three hospitals in Spain. Data were obtained from a nine-item open-ended questionnaire and a focus group. Deductive content analysis was performed. Ethical considerations: Ethical approval was obtained from the hospital ethics committee. Participants were assured their participation was voluntary. Findings: Nurses framed the use of restraints as a way of prioritising patients' physical safety. They referred to contextual factors as the main reasons to justify their application. Nurses perceived that their decision is approved by other colleagues and the patients' relatives. Some nurses started advocating against their use, but felt powerless to change this unsafe practice within an unfavourable climate. Control beliefs were linked to patients' medical condition, availability of alternative solutions, analgo-sedation policies and work organisation. Discussion: Safety arguments based on the surrounding work environment were discussed. Conclusion: Nurses' behavioural and control beliefs were related. Nurses should be trained in alternatives to physical restraint use. The impact of analgo-sedation protocols, relatives' involvement, leadership support and intensive care unit restraint policies on physical restraint practices need to be revised. Further research is required to explore why nurses do not act with moral courage to change this harmful practice.",0
491,"Prevention of delirium is considered a critical part of the agenda for patient safety and an indicator of healthcare quality for older patients. As the incidence rate of delirium for older patients has increased in recent years, there has been a significant expansion in knowledge relevant to nursing care. The purposes of this study were to analyze the knowledge structure and trends in nursing care for older adults with delirium based on a keyword network analysis, and to provide a foundation for future research. Data analysis showed that knowledge structure in this area consists of three themes of research: postoperative acute care for older patients with delirium, prevention of delirium for older patients in intensive care units, and safety management for the improvement of outcomes for patients with delirium. Through research trend analysis, we found that research on care for patients with delirium has achieved both quantitative and qualitative improvements over the last decades. Concerning future research, we propose the expansion of patient- and family-centered care, community care, specific nursing interventions, and the integration of new technology into care for patients with delirium. These results provide a reference framework for understanding and developing nursing care for older adults with delirium.",0
492,"The global burden of human death after experiencing serious health-related suffering (SHRS) requiring palliative care (PC) and end-of-life care (EOLC) is increasing. The largest increase in SHRS, death situations, PC, and EOLC needs continues to be in developing countries with limited access to PC. It is critical that nursing human resources in countries with limited access to PC are well trained and have adequate knowledge, attitudes, and skills to provide PC and EOLC. This study aimed to compare the PC knowledge and attitudes toward EOLC of future nursing human resources in Oman, India, and the Philippines. A comparative, cross-sectional design and two standardized questionnaires (the PEACE-Q and FATCOD-B) were used to collect data from 547 undergraduate nursing students (NSs). Overall, the NSs had positive attitudes toward EOLC (102.5 +/- 15.39), but moderate PC knowledge (20.99 +/- 3.59). The NSs were least knowledgeable about dyspnea, cancer pain, delirium, and side effects of opioids. Most of the NSs reported that their program did not include specific content about PC (56.1%) and hospice care (54.1%). The differences between countries and the predictors of PC knowledge and attitude toward EOLC were identified. The findings reveal gaps that need to be addressed in order to enhance access to PC and EOLC through well-trained nursing human resources.",0
493,"Objectives: The study aim was to explore the experience of doctors and nursing assistants in the management of physical restraint (PR) in critical care units. Method: A multicentre phenomenological study that included 14 critical care units (CCU) in Madrid (Spain). The CCU were stratified according to their use of physical restraint: ""frequently used"" versus ""seldom used"". Three focus groups were formed: the first comprised nursing assistants from CCUs that frequently used physical restraint, the second comprised nursing assistants from CCUs that seldom used physical constraint, and the final group comprised doctors from both CCU subtypes. Sampling method: purposive. Data analysis: thematic content analysis. Data saturation was achieved. Results: Four principle themes emerged: 1) concept of safety and risk (patient safety versus the safety of the professional), 2) types of restraint, 3) professional responsibilities (prescription, recording, and professional roles) and 4) ""zero restraint"" paradigm. The conceptualisation regarding the use of physical contentions shows differences in some of the principal themes, depending on the type of CCU, in terms of policies, use and management of physical constraint (frequently used versus seldom used). Conclusions: The real reduction in the use of physical restraint in CCU must be based on one crucial point: acceptance of the complexity of the phenomenon. The use of physical restraint observed in the different CCU is influenced by individual, group and organisational factors. These factors will determine how doctors and nursing assistants interpret safety and risk, the centre of care (patient or professional-centred care), the concept of restraint, professional responsibilities and interventions, interactions of the team and the leadership.

494,"Background Both high prevalence and incidence rates of delirium occur frequently among patients aged 65 years or older in intensive care units (ICUs) and are accompanied by adverse outcomes. Because of lack of nursing staff resources and imperfect humanistic care, delirium is easily overlooked by both physicians and nurses in the ICU in Mainland China. Purpose This study aimed to explore the incidence rate of delirium and to determine the risk factors among critically ill older patients. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted on patients aged 65 years and older who were admitted consecutively to two ICUs of a university-affiliated hospital in China. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale were used to assess delirium status twice daily. Patient demographic, laboratory, medical, therapeutic, and prognostic data were collected. Results One hundred fifteen patients were included as participants, with a median age of 70 years (range 65-93 years). Seventy-six (66.1%) patients presented with delirium. Half of the sample had a hypoactive subtype. Patients who developed delirium had a longer mean length of ICU stay, greater chance of physical restraints use, greater use of fentanyl, and poorer sleep quality. A logistic regression analysis revealed that poor sleep quality (OR= 10.74, 95% CI [1.59, 72.47]) and physical restraints (OR= 13.04, 95% CI [1.57, 107.94]) were significantly associated with delirium. Conclusions/Implications for Practice Delirium is a common aggravation in older patients following ICU admission. The factors found in this study to be independently associated with delirium include poor sleep quality and physical restraints. Both critical care physicians and nurses should pay greater attention to the quality of the ICU stay experienced by their older patients.",0
495,"Background: Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) nurses may consider additional factors beyond validated tools when managing pain and sedation of children. However, these other factors and related beliefs, practices, and decision-making for analgesia and sedation have not been well described. Objectives: This study describes nurses' beliefs, practices, and decision-making related to sedation and analgesia for mechanically ventilated children on a PICU and a pediatric cardiovascular ICU at a tertiary academic children's medical center in the United States. Methods: A 35-item web-based survey tool was developed to more fully identify nurses' pain, sedation, comfort, and analgesia beliefs, decisions, planning, and procedures for children who were mechanically ventilated in the ICU. It was distributed to 102 nurses in the PICU, pediatric cardiovascular ICU, and pediatric critical care float pool. Results: Twenty-six nurses (25%) responded; a majority worked the night shift and had 5 years or less of ICU experience. While participants believed intubated pediatric patients required moderate to deep sedation, approximately only half reported patients were adequately sedated. They reported that they were more likely to manage pain and sedation using specific behaviors and changes in vital signs than scores on a standardized scale. Nurses also reported routinely incorporating nonpharmacologic comfort measures. Premedication was more common for invasive procedures than for routine nursing care. Discussion: Pediatric ICU nurses in this study considered factors beyond standardized scales when evaluating and managing pain and sedation of ventilated children. Nurses prioritized children's specific behaviors, vital signs, and their own nursing judgment above standardized scales. Research is needed to describe nurses' practices beyond this small study and to define and validate additional assessment parameters to incorporate into decision-making to improve management and care outcomes.",0
496,"Objective: This study aims to investigate the effect of nonpharmacological intervention training on delirium recognition and the intervention strategies of intensive care (ICU) nurses. Method: This is a quasi-experimental study conducted using a pretest posttest design. The study sample included a total of 95 patients staying in the medical ICU of a university hospital and 19 nurses working in these units. The data were collected using the Patient and Nurse Introduction, Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU, and Delirium Risk Factors, and Non pharmacological Interventions in Delirium Prevention Forms. Results: Delirium was identified in 26.5% and 20.9% of the patients in the pre-and posttraining phase, respectively. Patients with delirium had a longer duration of stay in the ICU, lower mean Glasgow Coma Scale score and a higher number of medications in daily treatment (p<0.05). The risk of delirium increased 8.5-fold by physical restriction and 3.4-fold by the presence of hypo/hypernatremia. The delirium recognition rate of nurses increased from 7.7% to 33.3% in the post-training phase. Conclusion: Our study results show that training can increase the efficiency of ICU nurses in the management of delirium. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
497,"Objective: To review delirium screening tools available for use in the adult ICU and PICU, to review evidence-based delirium screening implementation, and to discuss common pitfalls encountered during delirium screening in the ICU. Data Sources: Review of delirium screening literature and expert opinion. Results: Over the past decade, tools specifically designed for use in critically ill adults and children have been developed and validated. Delirium screening has been effectively implemented across many ICU settings. Keys to effective implementation include addressing barriers to routine screening, multifaceted training such as lectures, case-based scenarios, one-on-one teaching, and real-time feedback of delirium screening, and interdisciplinary communication through discussion of a patient's delirium status during bedside rounds and through documentation systems. If delirium is present, clinicians should search for reversible or treatable causes because it is often multifactorial. Conclusion: Implementation of effective delirium screening is feasible but requires attention to implementation methods, including a change in the current ICU culture that believes delirium is inevitable or a normal part of a critical illness, to a future culture that views delirium as a dangerous syndrome which portends poor clinical outcomes and which is potentially modifiable depending on the individual patients circumstances.",0
498,"Background Family caregivers play an important role for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and delirium is a common clinical syndrome. Little is known about the experiences of family caregivers when a relative is a patient with delirium, especially for caregivers in Asian cultures. Aims and Objective To understand the experience of family caregivers with a family member as a patient with delirium in the ICU in Taiwan. Design A descriptive qualitative study with in-depth face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Methods Interviews were conducted with 20 family caregivers of 20 patients with delirium in the ICU of a hospital in northern Taiwan. Results The core theme describing the phenomenon of family caregivers of a patient with delirium was ""Sailing in a sea of perplexity,"" which described family caregivers' uncertainty of navigating the ICU and providing support for a relative. Three subthemes described the core theme: (a) perplexity of the ICU environment, (b) perplexity of making decisions, and (c) perplexity of Chinese cultural constraints. Conclusion ""Sailing in a sea of perplexity"" underscores how uncertainty among family caregivers of patients with delirium in ICUs can lead to feelings of fear and anxiety. Therefore, nursing professionals should not only focus on patient care but also be sensitive to caregivers' feelings of uncertainty and their cultural beliefs. Relevance to clinical practice Unfamiliarity and lack of knowledge about intensive care and patient treatments were a source of family caregivers' perplexity. To reduce uncertainty, we recommend increased communication between staff and caregivers. Hospitals can also provide information on their websites, including treatment of delirium and visitation hours. Information access could be enhanced by developing a smartphone app linked to a QR code that families can scan to obtain information, which would be useful during restricted visitation.",0

500,"Background: This multicenter cross-sectional study sought to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding the use of physical restraints by Chinese nurses in intensive care units (ICUs) of tertiary hospitals. Method: A scale technique was used to measure the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of 383 RNs from eight tertiary hospitals in Chongqing, China. Results: A total of 383 valid questionnaires were returned, for a response rate of 89.49%. Approximately 8.1% of the nurses were male, 67.1% had a bachelor's degree or above, and 55.09% were ICU specialists. The average age was 28.62 years (SD = 4.56). The mean scores were 74.33 of 111 (SD = 9.552), 24.41 of 40 (SD = 4.872), and 65.66 of 130 (SD = 20.880) regarding knowledge, attitudes, and nursing practices, respectively. For the attitude scale, the scores of nurses who were certified ICU specialists and had extensive working experience were higher than those with less experience; the difference was statistically significant (p < .05). Conclusion: Results indicated that nurses employed in the ICUs of tertiary hospitals in Chongqing, China, have relatively insufficient knowledge, comparatively incorrect attitudes, and unreasonable means of practicing physical restraint. Continuing education should focus strongly on the relationship between physical restraint and unplanned extubation, and guidelines on physical restraint urgently need to be developed.",0
501,"Aims and Objectives To evaluate nurses' care coordination competency for mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units (ICUs) of Saudi Arabia (SA). Background ICUs are increasingly using multidisciplinary approach to provide critical care. Functionality gaps remain within these teams preventing optimum performance, including a lack of adequate care coordination in the management of mechanically ventilated (MV) patients. Design A cross-sectional survey of ICU nurses working across 20 hospitals in SA. Methods The Nurses' Care Coordination Competency Scale (NCCCS) survey for MV patients was administered to all the nurses to assess their care coordination competence. The data were analysed using Student's t test, ANOVA and linear regression. Reporting of this research follows STROBE guidelines. Results A total of 254 nurses participated in the survey. The overall NCCCS mean score was 3.94 (+/- 0.69) out of a 5-point scale. Also, the ""promoting team cohesion factor (Factor 1)"" had a mean score of 3.90 (+/- 0.77), the ""understanding care coordination needs factor (Factor II)"" had a mean score of 4.00 (+/- 0.77), the ""aggregating and disseminating information factor (Factor III)"" had a mean score of 4.05 (+/- 0.76), and the ""devising and clearly articulating the care vision factor (Factor IV)"" had a mean score of 3.78 (+/- 0.87). The mean overall NCCCS score was 4.10 among Indians, 3.98 among Filipinos and 3.81 among Saudi nationals. Conclusion There were a high overall score and subscale scores of nurses' care coordination competence for mechanically ventilated patients, but few gaps were identified in some of the items. Relevance to Clinical Practice The results provide information on the status and gaps in ICU nurses' care coordination competencies to address the needs of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. The NCCCS can be utilised as an educational tool for nurses who are new to the ICU work environment.",0
502,"Purpose: Delirium has severe consequences on hospital mortality, length of stay, costs, and long-term cognitive function. No study has ever investigated French intensivists' attitude, a basis for management improvement. We conducted a national survey to describe the attitudes of French intensivists toward delirium screening and management. Methods: A questionnaire was sent by e-mail to the intensivists of the French intensive care society. Up to three e-mails have been sent to nonrespondents during a 75-day period. Results: The response rate was 25.7% (n = 283). Twenty-eight respondents (10%) reported screening for delirium with a validated screening tool. Among respondents, 60% estimated that delirium occurs in less than 25% of intubated patients. Antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and hydroxizine were prescribed as first-line therapy in 77%, 53%, and 36% of the cases, respectively. Mobilization of intubated patients occurred less frequently than estimated as possible. Physicians who screened for delirium had a higher estimation of its severity and occurrence than physicians who did not. Conclusions: Respondents among French intensivists rarely screen for delirium with a dedicated tool. Treatments reported as used in that setting are often different from the guidelines.",0
503,"Objectives: Knowledge regarding delirium prevention in patients with acute brain injury remains limited. We tested the hypothesis that an intervention bundle which targeted sedation, sleep, pain, and mobilisation would reduce delirium in patients with acute brain injury. Design: A prospective before-after intervention study: a five-month phase of standard care was followed by a six-month intervention phase. Setting: The neuro-intensive care unit, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark. Main outcome measures: The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist was used to detect delirium. Primary outcome was delirium duration; secondary outcomes were delirium prevalence, ICU length of stay and one year mortality. Results: Forty-four patients were included during the standard care phase, and 50 during the intervention phase. Delirium was present in 90% of patients in the standard care group and 88% in the intervention group (p = 1.0), and time with delirium was 4 days vs 3.5 days (p = 0.26), respectively. Also, ICU length of stay (13 vs. 10.5 days (p = 0.4)) and the one year mortality (21% vs 12% (p = 0.38))) were similar between groups. Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of delirium in patients with acute brain injury. The intervention bundle did not significantly reduce prevalence or duration of delirium, ICU length of stay or one year mortality. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
504,"Background Several nonpharmacological strategies for the prevention and treatment of delirium have been increasingly used because the aetiology of delirium is multifactorial. Aims To verify the association between nonpharmacological strategies (presence of companion, mobilization, absence of physical restraint and natural light) and the occurrence of delirium, and to identify risk factors for delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Study Design The study was conducted in a Brazilian medical and surgical ICU. The sample included patients older than 18 years with length of ICU stay greater than 24 h and without delirium on admission. Delirium was identified by applying the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). The association between the variables and delirium was analysed using Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regression to identify the predictive factors. Results Of the 356 patients, 64 (18%) had delirium. The presence of a companion, mobilization, and physical restraint were associated with delirium, and the first two were identified as protective factors. That is, the odds of delirium decreased by 88% when a companion was present and by 95% when the patient was mobilized. The risk factors of delirium were length of ICU stay and age. Conclusions The presence of a companion and patient mobilization were identified as protective factors against delirium, highlighting their importance as preventive actions, especially in patients with a higher risk of developing this disorder. The findings regarding physical restraint can also be considered evidence indicating the need for careful use of this measure in clinical practice until evidence of its relationship with delirium is confirmed. Relevance to Clinical Practice The implementation of strategies such as early mobilization, presence of a companion and careful assessment for the use of physical restraint by the multidisciplinary team can help control the occurrence of delirium in the ICU.",0
505,"Delirium, a prevalent organ dysfunction in critically ill patients, is independently associated with increased morbidity. This last decade has witnessed an exponential growth in delirium research in hospitalized patients, including those critically ill, and this research has highlighted that delirium needs to be better understood mechanistically to help foster research that will ultimately lead to its prevention and treatment. In this invited, evidence-based paper, a multinational and interprofessional group of clinicians and researchers from within the fields of critical care medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, anesthesiology, geriatrics, surgery, neurology, nursing, pharmacy, and the neurosciences sought to address five questions: (1) What is the current standard of care in managing ICU delirium? (2) What have been the major recent advances in delirium research and care? (3) What are the common delirium beliefs that have been challenged by recent trials? (4) What are the remaining areas of uncertainty in delirium research? (5) What are some of the top study areas/ trials to be done in the next 10 years? Herein, we briefly review the epidemiology of delirium, the current best practices for management of critically ill patients at risk for delirium or experiencing delirium, identify recent advances in our understanding of delirium as well as gaps in knowledge, and discuss research opportunities and barriers to implementation, with the goal of promoting an integrated research agenda.",0
506,"Background: Sedation practice has evolved from deep to lighter or no sedation in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The care of conscious intubated patients constitutes a change in the nurse-patient interaction. Objective: We aimed to compare the perspectives of expert and competent nurses regarding their interaction with non-sedated mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Method: The study had a qualitative comparative design applying semi-structured dyadic interviews. We interviewed five pairs of expert and competent ICU nurses with respectively >8 and 2-3 years of ICU experience and performed qualitative content analysis to explore the two perspectives. Findings: We identified four main categories illustrating complexities of nurse-patient interaction: Managing frustration, Attempting dialogue, Negotiating reality and Alleviating discomfort. Expert nurses expressed more frustration and ambivalence towards light sedation than competent nurses, who took awake patients for granted. All nurses experienced communication issues, demanding patients, and inability to provide adequate patient comfort. Conclusion: Our study added to the knowledge of nurse-patient interaction by describing issues of frustration, ambivalence and insecurity in a contemporary context of minimal sedation. Expert nurses were mere concerned by awake patients than competent nurses. Lighter sedation in ICU requires better staffing and improved communication tools. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0
507,"Introduction: Health care workers faced new challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic when physical contact with relatives more or less disappeared. Objectives: The aim of this study is to describe the experiences of critical care nurses (CCNs) working in intensive care units (ICUs) under the visiting restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19. Method: This study followed a qualitative design. The purposive sample included CCNs with at least I year of experience working in an ICU with a visiting policy affected by the pandemic. Data collection was carried out via semi-structured interviews and analyzed through a qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach. Results: The study results are presented in three categories with 10 subcategories. CCNs value the presence of patients' relatives at the bedside and described many challenges when relatives could not be present with the patient during the pandemic. Conclusion: Close relatives are able to share essential information about the patients and provide much-needed emotional support to them, the relatives' role is of central importance and CCNs value their presence in ICUs more than any positive consequences of them not being there.",0
508,"Background: Studies addressing critical care nurses' practices regarding physical restraints have focused on individual nurses' knowledge and attitudes but lack the understanding of other social influences that could affect nurses' intentions to use them. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine critical care nurses' attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, and intentions to use physical restraints in intubated patients and the relationship between them and sociodemographic, professional, and contextual factors using a survey approach. Methods: A cross-sectional, multicentre study was conducted in a convenience sample of 12 intensive care units from eight hospitals in Spain (n = 354). The Physical Restraint-Theory of Planned Behaviour questionnaire and a researcher-developed survey were used to collect structural and clinical data from each unit. Multilevel model analysis was used. Results: Critical care nurses showed a moderate level of intention to use physical restraints 12.52 (standard deviation = 3.81) [3-21]. More than a half (52%) agreed restraints were safe. The highest perceived barrier against physical restraint use was patient cooperation. Although nurses did not feel that others expected them to use restraints, they did not perceive high levels of disapproval of such practice. Nurses who had received previous training on restraints and who worked in units with a flexible family visitation policy, an informed consent form for restraint use, analgosedation and restraint protocols, and nurse-driven analgosedation management reported lower levels of intention to use re-straints. Working in smaller units (beta-1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI]:-0.18,-3.44) and working in units with a consent form for restraint use (beta-4.82; 95% CI:-2.80,-6.85) were the variables with the highest impact on nurses' intentions to use restraints. Conclusions: Critical care nurses' intentions to use physical restraints are moderate and are influenced by intrapersonal, patient, and contextual factors. Nurses who work in units with organisational policies and alternatives to restraints demonstrated lower levels of intention to use them. (c) 2019 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.

509,"The purpose of this project was to determine if bedside intensive care unit (ICU) nurse buy-in to the Family Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) protocol was sufficient to make implementation feasible at one county hospital in West Texas. Surveys were anonymous with ballot box collection being available to the bedside ICU nurses for one week each. Questions were based on literature findings of expected outcomes, identified barriers and facilitators, Calgary Family Intervention Method framework domains, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Framework for program evaluation. Outcome measures were taken from the stated aims of the project and evaluated from paired baseline and summative survey questions. Survey participation was approximately half of nurses employed in the studied ICU. Analysis of the surveys showed a positive perception of family presence decreasing patient delirium symptoms, and a positive perception of the Family HELP protocol. The results described a high perception of family members as partners in care and high intention to implement the Family HELP protocol, indicating strong support of a full implementation of the protocol. The high level of bedside nurse buy-in present in this study has large implications for successful implementation of the Family HELP protocol in the near future, with sustainability and continued use supported by potential inclusion of the task in the electronic health record charting.",0
510,"Background: Rehabilitative exercise for critically ill patients may have many benefits; however, it is unknown what intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians perceive to be important rationale for the implementation of rehabilitative exercise in critical care settings. Objective: To identify which rationales for rehabilitative exercise interventions were perceived by ICU clinicians to be important and determine whether perceptions were consistent across nursing, medical and physiotherapy clinicians. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken among clinicians (nursing, medical, physiotherapy) working in a mixed medical surgical ICU in an Australian metropolitan tertiary hospital. Participants completed a customised web-based questionnaire developed by a clinician working-group. The questionnaire consisted of 11 plausible rationales for commencing rehabilitative exercise in ICUs based on prior literature and their own clinical experiences grouped into 4 over-arching categories (musculoskeletal, respiratory, psychological and facilitation of discharge). Participants rated their perceived importance for each potential rationale on a 5-point Likert scale. Results: Participants (n = 76) with a median (interquartile range) 4.8 (1.5, 15.5) years of experience working in ICUs completed the questionnaire. Responses were consistent across professional disciplines. Clinicians rated rehabilitative exercise as either 'very much' or 'somewhat' important for facilitating discharge (n = 76, 100%), reducing muscle atrophy (n = 76, 100%), increasing muscle strength (n = 76, 100%), prevention of contractures (n = 73, 96%), reducing the incidence of ICU acquired weakness (n = 62, 82%), increasing oxygenation (n = 71, 93%), facilitating weaning (n = 72, 97%), reducing anxiety (n = 60, 80%), reducing depression (n = 64, 84%), reducing delirium (n = 53, 70%), and increasing mental alertness (n = 65, 87%). Conclusions: Any shortcoming in implementation of rehabilitation exercise is unlikely attributable to a lack of perceived importance by nursing, medical or physiotherapy clinicians who are the most likely clinicians to influence rehabilitation practices in ICUs. It is noteworthy that this study examined self-reported perceptions, not physiological or scientific legitimacy of rationales, or clinician behaviours in practice.

511,"Background: Early mobilization (EM) of critically ill adult patients in intensive care units (ICUs) is a newer concept. It is known to improve overall outcomes, but little is known regarding the attitude and knowledge of healthcare providers (HCPs) and multidisciplinary barriers to its use in the Indian scenario. Objectives: To study the knowledge and attitude of HCPs in ICU about the EM of adult patients who are critically ill and identify perceived barriers to the application of EM. Methods: In a cross-sectional survey conducted in a tertiary care academic institute, the HCPs, namely, physicians, anesthetists, surgeons, nursing staff, and physiotherapists working in ICU were interviewed using a self-structured questionnaire. The data were presented as descriptive statistics. Results: There was 80% response rate. The benefits of EM as shortened length of mechanical ventilation (MV) were acknowledged by 78% respondents and 54% believed that it maintains muscle strength. It was considered crucial by 44% respondents, who opined that it should be started as the patient's cardiorespiratory status stabilizes. The favorable attitudes observed were recognition of benefits for patients under MV exceeded the risks and readiness by physicians to reduce sedation levels and change the parameters of MV. The main barriers identified were the absence of written guidelines or protocols for EM, limited staff to mobilize patients, inadequate training of HCP to facilitate EM, excessive sedation, and medical instability. Conclusion: There exists an awareness of the benefits of EM and favorable attitudes to its application. However, the actual performance of EM was perceived as a challenge due to barriers identified in the study.",0
512,"Managing acute alcohol withdrawal in critical care presents a unique challenge to the critical care nurse. The prominence of alcohol use within the Australian community means that many critical care admissions involve acute alcohol withdrawal, an alcohol induced illness, or indeed an unrelated admission with underlying heavy alcohol intake. Current statistics suggest 1 in 5 Australians drink to 'risky' levels each month. This suggests that most critical care nurses will encounter a patient who is experiencing active withdrawal from alcohol, often without clear physiological symptomatology. Acute alcohol withdrawal delirium can be difficult to distinguish from other forms of delirium and in the absence of a comprehensive history, alcohol withdrawal and its sequelae may go untreated. Contemporary management guidelines for alcohol withdrawal suggest a common framework of first line benzodiazepine usage, with emerging research focusing on adjunctive therapy aimed at reducing benzodiazepine doses, and therefore reducing length of stay in the critical care unit. The controversial therapy of ethanol infusion and common assessment and withdrawal scales are examined in relation to their usefulness in critical care. Alcohol withdrawal management in critical care necessitates careful nursing assessment, including alcohol usage history, delirium management, withdrawal assessment and symptomatic relief using an evidence-based protocol. 2010 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.

513,"Background: There is scant literature on the barriers to rehabilitation for patients discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) to acute care wards. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess ward-based rehabilitation practices and barriers and assess knowledge and perceptions of ward clinicians regarding health concerns of ICU survivors. Methods, design, setting, and participants: This was a single-centre survey of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals caring for ICU survivors in an Australian tertiary teaching hospital. Main outcome measures: The main outcome measures were knowledge of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) amongst ward clinicians, perceptions of ongoing health concerns with current rehabilitation practices, and barriers to inpatient rehabilitation for ICU survivors. Results: The overall survey response rate was 35% (198/573 potential staff). Most respondents (66%,126/190) were unfamiliar with the term PICS. A majority of the respondents perceived new-onset physical weakness, sleep disturbances, and delirium as common health concerns amongst ICU survivors on acute care wards. There were multifaceted barriers to patient mobilisation, with inadequate multidisciplinary staffing, lack of medical order for mobilisation, and inadequate physical space near the bed as common institutional barriers and patient frailty and cardiovascular instability as the commonly perceived patient-related barriers. A majority of the surveyed ward clinicians (66%,115/173) would value education on health concerns of ICU survivors to provide better patient care. Conclusion: There are multiple potentially modifiable barriers to the ongoing rehabilitation of ICU survivors in an acute care hospital. Addressing these barriers may have benefits for the ongoing care of ICU survivors. (C) 2019 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
514,"Despite current advances in critical care medicine, delirium remains a frequent complication of an intensive care unit stay. The consequences can be severe and far reaching, including an increase in mortality, length of stay, and long-term cognitive sequelae. Frequently, delirium can be missed by clinicians who fail to complete a standardized delirium screening tool and, therefore, many cases go unrecognized and untreated. A multidimensional education program is one of the most effective methods to increase awareness of the condition and increase compliance in utilizing standardized delirium screening tools at the bedside.",0
515,"BackgroundSedation management is an integral component of critical care practice. It requires the greatest attention of critical care practitioners because it carries significant risks to patients. Therefore, it is imperative that nurses are aware of potential adverse consequences of sedation therapy and current sedation practice recommendations. Aims and objectivesTo evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on nurses' knowledge of sedation assessment and management. Designs and methodsA quasi-experimental design with a pre- and post-test method was used. The educational intervention included theoretical sessions on assessing and managing sedation and hands-on sedation assessment practice using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale. Its effect was measured using self-administered questionnaire, completed at the baseline level and 3 months following the intervention. ResultsParticipants were 68 registered nurses from an intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Malaysia. Significant increases in overall mean knowledge scores were observed from pre- to post-intervention phases (mean of 7900 versus 10200, p < 0001). Nurses with fewer than 5 years of work experience, less than 26 years old, and with a only basic nursing education had significantly greater level of knowledge improvement at the post-intervention phase compared to other colleagues, with mean differences of 2464 (p = 0001), 2381 (p = 0027) and 2725 (p = 00001), respectively. A repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant effect of educational intervention on knowledge score after controlling for age, years of work and level of nursing education (p = 00001, (2)(p) = 0431). ConclusionAn educational intervention consisting of theoretical sessions and hands-on sedation assessment practice was found effective in improving nurses' knowledge and understanding of sedation management. Relevance to clinical practiceThis study highlighted the importance of continuing education to increase nurses' understanding of intensive care practices, which is vital for improving the quality of patient care.",0
516,"Introduction Physical restraint is widely used in intensive care units. Critical care nurses are the primary decision makers and practitioners of physical restraint. However, little is known about the qualitative evidence of their experience of physical restraint. Aims To aggregate, synthesise and interpret the qualitative evidence of studies that explored critical care nurses' experiences of physical restraint in intensive care units. Methods A qualitative systematic review and meta-synthesis was conducted following Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and reported following the ENTREQ statement. Qualitative studies published in the English and Chinese were systematically searched in eight databases. PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database from inception to November 2021. Two reviewers independently assessed the study eligibility and performed the data extraction and the quality appraisal. A meta-aggregative approach was used to synthesise findings. The review protocol was registered prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42021278671). Results Thirteen studies were included. A total of 48 intact and definite codes were extracted and classified into ten sub-categories. Four themes were finally identified: intention, alternatives, determinants, and reflection. Conclusion The intention of critical care nurses to use physical restraint is primarily driven by patient safety. Nurses will consider alternatives; however, many determinants urge nurses to implement physical restraint. Nurses prefer to sacrifice patients' comfort to ensure their safety. When nurses reflect on what they have done, some experience moral distress, but most rationalise their decision making. Further studies should explore the safety of alternatives, reduce the use of physical restraint, and pay more attention to nurses' moral distress through these insights. Relevance to clinical practice Developing alternatives, providing relevant training for nurses, physicians, patients, and families to facilitate a restraint-free culture, and developing high-quality guidelines and regulations are essential strategies to reduce the use of physical restraint in ICUs.",0
517,"Aims and objectives To explore in depth discomfort in intensive care as experienced by patients and attended to by critical care nurses. Background Discomfort in illness is complex and persistent, and its alleviation is a challenge for nurses working in intensive care units (ICU). In previous studies, we showed that ICU patients described little actual pain but suffer from much discomfort. Critical care nurses had a systematic approach to the treatment of pain, but were more haphazard in dealing with other types of discomfort. Design Secondary qualitative analysis of data from two previous exploratory studies. Methods Content analysis was used on existing data from 28 interviews with ICU patients, and 16 field notes and interviews with critical care nurses. Kolcaba's Comfort Theory was applied for further analysis. The COREQ checklist was used. Results Three themes, ""Being deprived of a functioning body"", ""Being deprived of a functioning mind"" and ""Being deprived of integrity"" characterised the discomfort experienced by ICU patients. The nurses appeared to attend to all areas of discomfort expressed by patients. In need of, and providing acknowledgment and alleviation became a common overarching theme. We identified a comfort gap caused by the discrepancy between the patients' needs and the nurses' achievements in fulfilling these needs. Conclusions A gap exists between ICU patients' comfort needs and nurses' achievements in fulfilling these, indicating that discomfort currently is an inevitable part of the critical illness trajectory. Increased knowledge about how the brain is affected in ICU patients and more systematic approaches to assessing comfort needs and enhancing comfort may support nurses in fulfilling patient needs and possibly diminish the existing comfort gap. Relevance for clinical practice An increased understanding of the complex experience of discomfort in ICU patients may bring about more systematic approaches to enhance comfort and direct for education and further research.",0
518,"P>Aim. This paper is a report of a Neuman systems model-guided study of the effects of nurse-facilitated family participation in psychological care on the extent of patient delirium and psychological recovery following critical illness. Background. Psychological disturbances resulting from critical illness have been well documented in international literature. Few studies have tested interventions designed to alleviate such disturbances. Methods. A comparative time series design was used. A total of 170 critically ill patients and families participated in the study - 83 in the control group and 87 in the intervention group. Data were collected during critical illness and subsequent recovery using the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System-28, Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist and the Sickness Impact Profile. The study was carried out in Northern Ireland, data collection taking place from January 2004 to December 2005. Results/findings. Nurse-facilitated family participation in psychological care did not significantly reduce the incidence of delirium among patients in critical care, but patients receiving intervention demonstrated better psychological recovery and wellbeing than the control group at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after admission to critical care. Conclusion. Nurse-facilitated family participation in the psychological care may strengthen the lines of defence and resistance against the stressors experienced by the patient during critical illness and improve psychological recovery.",0
519,"Background As survivorship following critical illness improves, there is greater focus on maximizing recovery. As well as physical effects, critical illness often results in cognitive impairments such as delirium, anxiety, or disorientation. In other populations, such as delirium, non-pharmacological approaches to manage these conditions are preferred, including re-orientation and ensuring personal care needs are met. Cognitive rehabilitation is also well documented for patients with neuropsychological deficits. Treatments include memory aids, compensation strategies, and functional execution. In other hospital populations, games and activities have been utilized to optimize patient engagement, stimulation, and aid recovery, but it is considered an emerging therapy in intensive care. Aims This service evaluation aimed to gather multidisciplinary team members' perceptions of the use of games based therapy (GBT) in critical care, including patient engagement and acceptability in clinical practice. Study design A UK-based single-centre qualitative service evaluation. Methods Purposive sampling was used to identify interviewees within an adult intensive care who had experience of using a recently implemented GBT intervention. Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews, which were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Eight staff members across the multidisciplinary team were interviewed. One overarching theme of humanizing health care was identified, with three sub-themes of enhancing recovery, non-physical components of care, and bespoke tailoring. In addition, further recommendations for development of the service were summarized. Conclusion GBT was well received by staff in clinical practice. It was described as a supportive adjunct to traditional care and rehabilitation, enhancing staff-patient relationships. While it was recognized it may not suit all patients, GBT has the potential to enhance cognitive and physical recovery.",0
520,"Background: The purpose was to investigate nurses' experiences in identifying, preventing and treating delirium among elderly patients hospitalized for orthopedic surgery within different phases of the hospitalization. Data from a previous study of nurses' experiences with delirium among elderly was reanalyzed. Delirium is associated with serious complications, prolonged hospitalization and delayed rehabilitation. Methods: Data from focus group interviews with fifteen nurses from orthopedic departments were reanalyzed. Qualitative content analysis was used. Findings: Limited attention and inadequate procedures in the different phases provided different challenges. The preoperative phase was particularly critical for developing delirium, while nurses described lack of possibilities to prevent it. Conclusion: Increased skills and implementation of evidence-based procedures in nursing practice to meet the elderlies' need for security and to reduce the risk of delirium seem necessary. Inadequate procedures in each phase of a hospitalization in connection with orthopedic surgery can cause important prevention and treatment to not be initiated. Distinct initiative and better treatment of delirium seem required.",0
521,"BackgroundIn the 21st century, we are starting to discover and understand the longer term sequelae of critical illness from both patient's and family members' perspectives. The consequential effects on physical and psychological function and the social landscape are being slowing realized. We are beginning to understand the long-term legacy of critical care, with survivorship possibly the greatest challenge within the critical care setting. AimTo draw together research that has appraised the experience of surviving critical illness from the holistic, triadic perspectives of survivor, relative and critical care nurse. In doing so, knowledge of the complexities of the critical care trajectory is enhanced. Search Strategy: Using Medline; Assia; CINAHL Plus; SCOPUS; Web of knowledge searches from 2000 to 2015 were conducted utilizing the terms critical care'; intensive care', ITU; patient*; relative*; family member*; experience*; nurse*, and trajectory. Relevant exclusion criteria were applied to provide a generalist adult critical care perspective. ResultsFollowing a process of constant comparative analysis of the literature and thematic synthesis, seven themes were highlighted. Facing mortality, critical junctures, physiological sequelae, psychological sequelae, family presence, beyond meeting the needs of family members and technology versus humanity were all emergent themes. ConclusionAs humans, we do not live an isolated life; we are interdependent upon each other. This inclusive review of literature has highlighted the lacunae and areas of dissonance both in the literature and in clinical practice in relation to the critical care trajectory as experienced by survivors of critical illness and their families. Relevance to clinical practiceCritical care nurses can and should play a role in preparing and supporting patients and families beyond the critical care unit. In turn, Registered Nurses needed to be supported to fulfil this important role in enabling the process of moving patients and their families from surviving to thriving (survivorship).",0
522,"Background: Early mobility is underutilized in critical care. Objective: Describe multidisciplinary intensive care unit (ICU) providers beliefs about the conduct of early mobility during critical illness. Methods: A 7-item elicitation survey was administered to a multidisciplinary sample of ICU team members. We conducted independent thematic analysis of n = 95 surveys. Results: Analysis resulted in three themes: immediate risk vs. long-term reward conflict, nurse is the initiator and coordinator of early mobilization, and situational factors. Staffing was the primary facilitator and barrier to early mobility. Enablers included protection from complications of hospitalization, reduced hospital length of stay, and improved patient morale. Barriers strongly revolved around team member risk aversion (e.g., falls, hemodynamic instability, line dislodgment). Nurses were equally identified as positive and negative referents for early mobility. Conclusions: Strong positive and negative attitudinal beliefs were elicited. Early mobility is a protective behavior that requires sufficient numbers of trained staff and equipment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
523,"Aim To explore the patients ' experiences of pain when being cared for in the intensive care. Design An exploratory, qualitative design was chosen. Method Interviews were performed with patients (October 2015-March 2017) within a week of post-intensive care (N = 16). Thematic analysis was used as method for analysis. Results The findings generated two themes - a lack of control and to struggle for control. Pain was described as overwhelming, both in body and mind and generating the experience of a lack of control, with feelings of incapacitation, isolation, and having their needs unmet. Feeling in control of the pain and thus in control of the situation was experienced as a constant struggle. Well-planned care, finding ways to handle the pain and good communication were all helpful in this struggle. Conclusion The participants recalled their experience of pain in the ICU and control seems to be crucial for how pain is experienced. They experienced a lack of control due to not only the pain but also the treatment, which can be avoided by the nurse continuously evaluating and individualising the care. Balanced care, meeting the patients' needs and good communication helps the patient feel more in control when experiencing pain. Impact The experience of pain is dependent on control for the intensive care patient. The nurse may help them gain control and thereby handle the experience of pain through including the patient, striving for better communication and implementing individualised care that continuously assesses and treats pain.",0
524,"Background: Early mobilisation (EM) of critically ill patients is an evidence-based intervention designed to improve treatment outcomes and enhance the quality of life after intensive care. However, several barriers exist to its establishment in clinical practice. Thus, the objective of the present study was to identify barriers perceived by critical care nurses, corresponding educational needs, and provide useful information for program implementation in Korea. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2017 using a structured, self-administered questionnaire that was completed by 151 critical care nurses from three tertiary hospitals and four secondary hospitals located in Seoul. The survey was designed to rate experiences with EM, identify educational experiences, and measure perceived barriers regarding attitudes, knowledge, behaviours, and educational needs. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and analyses of variance. Results: The mean number of perceived barriers was 3.13 +/- 0.38 out of 5 on a Likert scale. Attitude-related barriers (3.25 +/- 0.49) were higher than behaviour-related (3.21 +/- 0.44) and knowledge-related (2.94 +/- 0.59) barriers. The top five barrier items were high workload, patients' inability to exercise, lack of time, inappropriate nurse/patient ratio, and absence of relevant education. Educational needs for early mobilisation were rated 3.74 +/- 0.78 out of 5. Educational items were prioritised as identifying potential problems in EM and possible solutions, related protocols and guidelines, and procedures for special conditions. Conclusions: The present study revealed that critical care nurses in Korea perceive various barriers to successfully implementing evidence-based EM interventions for critically ill patients, as well as the educational needs necessary to overcome such challenges. Accordingly, an educational program should be developed based on the educational needs revealed in the present study. In parallel, organisational efforts should also be made to meet environmental conditions. (C) 2018 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
525,"Objective: Evidence-based guidelines recommend promoting sleep in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), yet many patients experience poor sleep quality. We sought to engage allied health staff and patient families to determine barriers to sleep promotion, to measure sleep quality for ICU patients, and to evaluate the improvement in sleep quality after implementation of nursing morning report protocol and a doorway poster. Design: The study followed an interrupted time-series framework of quality improvement. Qualitative diagnostics included focus groups and interviews with patients, families, and allied health care workers, analyzed by qualitative descriptive analysis. Quantitative diagnostics included direct observation of nurses and patients overnight. Analysis of primary outcome data used statistical process control methodology. Patients: Patients included were >18 years old, admitted overnight to a Canadian tertiary academic ICU, with a Richards Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) >=-2. Interventions: Sleep quality was measured using the Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ). Two interventions were developed: sleep quality in morning nursing report, and a doorway poster. Main results: A total of 2332 patient nights across 7 consecutive months were included for analysis. Baseline sleep in the ICU was poor (mean RCSQ 53.7/100). Root cause-analysis identified the most prominent sleep barriers as nurse stigma associated with less active management of patients and lack of physician engagement. No significant improvement occurred over the sleep quality improvement initiative (mean RCSQ 59.5/100). Sleep quality was better among non-delirious patients compared with delirious patients (mean RCSQ 62.7 vs 53.3). Conclusion: The intervention of a nursing morning report protocol and sleep posters did not improve the quality of ICU patient sleep in this study. Structured interviews revealed potential sleep barriers to be addressed such as nursing stigma and inappropriate awakenings. Nursing stigma has not been previously linked to sleep quality.",0
526,"Delirium is defined as an abrupt or rapid change in mental status or mood, having difficulties with concentration and general disorder in ability to think, as well as experiencing confusion and altered consciousness. The incidence of delirium in intensive care units varies from about 4 to 83%. This difference can be attributed to reasons linked with various levels of training of the health professionals establishing the scores, the depth of sedation, and the differences in samples studied. Its etiology is clearly multifactorial. It has been shown that the occurrence of delirium has a strong impact on the vital and functional prognosis of patients in resuscitation, associated with an increase in early and late hospital mortality as well as a cognitive decline which may persist beyond the stay in the intensive care unit. It is important to note that the critical care serviced to patients experiencing delirium is extremely heterogeneous. However, new data from literature provides concrete ways to manage this syndrome and proposes a guide to paramedical practice for the prevention and screening of this cognitive disorder. The objective of this work is, therefore, to synthesize the literature available in this field, highlighting the key role of the paramedical profession in this context in identifying the diagnostic and therapeutic elements to put in practice, and so to modify care practices.",0
527,"Background: Delirium is prevalent in hospitalized older adults. Little is known about delirium among older adults admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence of delirium, length of stay, 30-day readmission and mortality rates experienced by older adults in the SICU before and after a nurse-driven protocol for delirium-informed care. Methods: This study employed a retrospective observational cohort design. Consecutive patients 65 years or older admitted to the SICU over six-month periods were compared before (n = 101) and following (n = 172) a nurse-driven protocol for delirium-informed care. Patient-level outcomes included incidence delirium, SICU and hospital length of stay, 30-day readmission and mortality rates. All measures were collected using medical record review. Results: In the pre- and post-intervention cohorts, 37% (37/101) and 33% (56/172) of patients screened positive for delirium, respectively. Following implementation of the delirium-informed care intervention, the number of days where no CAM-ICU assessment was performed significantly decreased (Pre 1.1 +/- 1.4; Post 0.45 +/- 0.65; p <0.001) and the number of negative assessments significantly increased (Pre 2.45 +/- 1.66; Post 2.94 +/- 1.69; p < 0.0178), indicating that nurses post-intervention were more consistently assessing for delirium. Conclusions: This study failed to show improvements in patient outcomes (SICU and hospital length of stay, 30-day readmission and mortality rates), before and following a delirium-informed care intervention. However, positive trends in the data suggest that delirium-informed care has the potential to increase rates of assessment and delirium identification, thereby providing the foundation for reducing the consequences of delirium and improve patient-level outcomes. Further better controlled prospective work is needed to validate this intervention. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
528,"Background: Delirium affects up to 80% of critically ill patients; however, many cases of delirium go unrecognized because of inaccurate assessments. The effectiveness of interventions to improve assessment accuracy among the general population has been established, but assessments among neuroscience patients are uniquely complicated due to the presence of structural neurologic changes. Objectives: The purposes of this quality improvement project were to improve the accuracy of nurse's delirium assessments among neuroscience patients and to determine the comparative effectiveness of the intervention between medical and neuroscience patients. Methods: A multifaceted nurse-led intervention was implemented, and a retrospective analysis of preintervention and postintervention data on assessment accuracy was completed. Results were stratified by population, level of sedation, and level of care. Differences were analyzed using Fisher exact test. Results: Data from 1052 delirium assessments were analyzed and demonstrated improvement in assessment accuracy from 56.82% to 95.07% among all patients and from 29.79% to 92.98% among sedate or agitated patients. Although baseline accuracy was significantly lower among neuroscience patients versus medical intensive care unit patients, no significant differences in postintervention accuracy were noted between groups. Conclusion: Results from this project demonstrate the effectiveness of the nurse-led intervention among neuroscience patients. Future research is needed to explore the effectiveness of this nurse-led intervention across other institutions and to describe the effectiveness of new interventions to improve outcomes at the patient and organizational levels.",0
529,"Background: The appropriate use of analgesia, sedation, neuromuscular blockade and the diagnosis and prevention of delirium (ASBD) are associated with better outcomes in critically ill patients at Intensive Care Unit (ICUs). Aim: To know the practices about analgesia, sedation, delirium, and neuromuscular blockade use among healthcare professionals working in adult ICUs in Chile. Material and Method: An electronic survey was sent to 812 professionals working in ICUs using a previously published instrument, which was adapted and authorized by the author. Results: We received 278 surveys. Fifty two percent of respondents were physicians, 34% nurses and 11% physical therapists. Their age ranged between 30 and 39 years in 43% and was over 50 years in 9%. Eighty four percent evaluated pain routinely, but only 26% use a validated scale. Sedation was routinely evaluated with a validated scale and 73% referred to have a protocol. Neuromuscular block is seldom used, and little monitoring occurs (43%). Delirium is routinely evaluated by 48% of respondents, usually using the CAM-ICU scale. Conclusions: There is a heterogeneous adherence to the ASBD recommended practices. The main gaps are in the assessment of pain, monitoring of neuromuscular blockade and diagnosis of delirium through validated instruments.",0
530,"Background The architectural design of the pediatric intensive care unit may play a major role in optimizing the environment to promote patients' sleep while improving stress levels and the work experience of critical care nurses. Objectives To examine changes in nurses' perceptions of the environment of a pediatric critical care unit for promotion of patients' sleep and the nurses' work experience after a transition from multipatient rooms to single-patient rooms. Methods A cross-sectional survey of nurses was conducted before and after the move to a new hospital building in which all rooms in the pediatric critical care unit were single-patient rooms. Results Nurses reported that compared with multipatient rooms, single-patient private rooms were more conducive to patients sleeping well at night and promoted a more normal sleep-wake cycle (P < .001). Monitors/alarms and staff conversations were the biggest factors that adversely influenced the environment for sleep promotion in both settings. Nurses were less annoyed by noise in single-patient rooms (33%) than in multipatient rooms (79%; P < .001) and reported improved exposure to sunlight. Conclusions Use of single-patient rooms rather than multipatient rooms improved nurses' perceptions of the pediatric intensive care unit environment for promoting patients' sleep and the nurses' own work experience.",0
531,"Introduction: Delirium is an acute disturbance of consciousness and cognition. It is a common disorder in the intensive care unit (ICU) and associated with impaired long-term outcome. Despite its frequency and impact, delirium is poorly recognized by ICU-physicians and - nurses using delirium screening tools. A completely new approach to detect delirium is to use monitoring of physiological alterations. Temperature variability, a measure for temperature regulation, could be an interesting component to monitor delirium, but whether temperature regulation is different during ICU delirium has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether ICU delirium is related to temperature variability. Furthermore, we investigated whether ICU delirium is related to absolute body temperature. Methods: We included patients who experienced both delirium and delirium free days during ICU stay, based on the Confusion Assessment method for the ICU conducted by a research- physician or - nurse, in combination with inspection of medical records. We excluded patients with conditions affecting thermal regulation or therapies affecting body temperature. Daily temperature variability was determined by computing the mean absolute second derivative of the temperature signal. Temperature variability (primary outcome) and absolute body temperature (secondary outcome) were compared between delirium-and non-delirium days with a linear mixed model and adjusted for daily mean Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale scores and daily maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. Results: Temperature variability was increased during delirium-days compared to days without delirium (beta(unadjusted)=0.007, 95% confidence interval (CI)= 0.004 to 0.011, p<0.001). Adjustment for confounders did not alter this result (beta(adjusted)=0.005, 95% CI=0.002 to 0.008, p<0.001). Delirium was not associated with absolute body temperature (beta(unadjusted)=-0.03, 95% CI=-0.17 to 0.10, p=0.61). This did not change after adjusting for confounders (beta(adjusted)=-0.03, 95% CI=-0.17 to 0.10, p=0.63). Conclusions: Our study suggests that temperature variability is increased during ICU delirium.",0
532,"Delirium is a common complication among patients in ICU settings. The accuracy of using the assessment tool CAM-ICU to detect delirium is relatively low during routine practice among bedside nurses. The aim of this study is to develop a mobile application (app) to detect delirium in early stage and to test its usability among ICU nurses. The app was developed with Java and installed on a mobile device. A questionnaire was created based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) measuring their response to the four domains of TAM: perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), attitudes towards usage (ATU) and behavioral intention to use (BIU). One hundred and two ICU nurses completed the survey. The result indicated that the app we developed has easy to use interfaces and is easier to use compared to the regular CAM-ICU",0
533,"Background: Chronic critical illness (CCI) patients have poor functional outcomes, high risk of mortality, and significant sequelae, including delirium and cognitive dysfunction. The prognostic significance of persistent delirium in patients with CCI has not been well described. Objective: We report a case of a patient with CCI following major cardiac surgery who was hemodynamically stable following a long course in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU), but had persistent and unremitting delirium. Despite both pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to improve his delirium, the patient ultimately continued to have symptoms of delirium and subsequently died in the CTICU. Efforts to reconsider the goals of care, given his family's understanding of his values, were met with resistance as his cardiothoracic surgeon believed that he had a reasonable chance of recovery since his organs were not in failure. This case description raises the question of whether we should consider persistent delirium as a prodrome syndrome before death in patients with CCI. Design: Study and analysis of a case of a patient with CCI following major cardiothoracic surgery who was hemodynamically stable with persistent delirium. Conclusions: Further studies of the prevalence and outcomes of prolonged or persistent agitated delirium in patients with chronic critical illness are needed to provide prognostic information that can assist patients and families in receiving care that accords with their goals and values.",0
534,"The number of people with dementia is increasing rapidly worldwide. Commensurate with population ageing, the use of nursing homes in Australia (known as residential aged care facilities) for individuals with dementia is growing. As a terminal condition, dementia is best managed by instituting a palliative approach to care. A good knowledge of dementia, including its progression and management, among staff and families of people living with dementia is essential for clear decision making and the provision of appropriate care. Yet there is limited information regarding relative levels of dementia knowledge. This paper reports the results of a study that assessed dementia knowledge among these two cohorts using the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Tool; the study surveyed 279 staff members and 164 family members of residents with dementia. Dementia knowledge deficits were evident in both cohorts across a range of areas. It is critical that dementia knowledge deficits are identified and addressed in order to support evidence-based dementia care.",0
535,"Purpose: To investigate physicians' perception of patients' tolerance levels regarding sedation, which could affect sedation practice for mechanically ventilated (MV) patients. Methods: This is a questionnaire survey combined with a 24 h cross-sectional study. The physician's propensity score for light sedation (PS-(LS)) was estimated by his/her response to the given answers for each item of the questionnaire, which tested the levels of interviewee's desire to manage MV patient with light sedation. Thereby, the mean physicians' PS-(LS) of each participating ICU (ICU-meanPS-(LS)) was calculated. The practical measurements of all variables listed on the questionnaire were used to semi-quantitatively assess stimulus intensity of what the recruited patients suffered (i.e., semi-quantitative stimulus intensity, SSI). Sedation depth was assessed by Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS). Results: 555 of 558 (99.5%) physicians from 102 ICUs were concerned with patients' tolerance levels regarding sedation while titrating sedation depth. The physician's PS-(LS) was non-normally distributed with median (IQR) of 3 (0-5). ICU-meanPS-(LS) was calculated in 92 out of 102 ICUs participating in the cross-sectional study, which was ranged from -5 to 7 with a median (IQR) of 2.37 (0.16-4.33). A significant increasing trend in prevalence of light sedation was observed over increasing ICU-meanPS-(LS) quartiles (from Q1 to Q4, chi(2)-test for trend, p = 0.002). Moreover, odds ratio for probability of light sedation remained significant in MV patients from Q4 ICUs vs. Q1 ICUs, adjusted by APACHE II score (OR, 2.332; 95% CI: 1.463-3.717; p < 0.001) or SSI score (OR, 2.445; 95% CI: 1.468-4.074; p = 0.001). Notably, adjusted OR for mortality was significant in deeply sedated MV patients (OR, 2.034; 95% CI: 1.435-2.884; p < 0.001). Conclusions: ICU physician's individualized perception for patients' tolerance levels regarding sedation, in light sedation affected sedation practice for MV patients.",0
536,"Aims and objectives. To establish patients' experiences after discharge from critical care and to evaluate implementation of a follow-up service. Background. Government recommendations advise critical care follow-up to prevent readmission and address problems after discharge. Admission to critical care results in significant psychological and physiological sequelae. Design. A prospective, longitudinal and exploratory study of surgical cancer patients requiring > 48 hours in critical care. Qualitative interviews were conducted and short questionnaires were used. Methods. Patient Expert Advisory Groups were invited to participate in research design. Patients were visited in the ward at days 1 and 5 after discharge, invited to nurse-led follow-up clinic and interviewed at three and six months. Short questionnaires were administered at six and 12 months. Findings. Twenty-seven patients participated in the study. All patients experienced benefit from the service. Emergent themes included: rehabilitation from critical care: physiological issues and needs, memories: real and unreal, uncertainty and fear and empathy. A core theme of reassurance was underlying through the research. Issues while in critical care included: the need for nursing presence, nightmares, delusions, confusion, fear of ward transfer, inability to remember, disorientation and being prepared for the experience. After discharge, issues shifted to longer term needs. Psychological support, in the form of the follow-up clinic, proved useful. The ability to move on with life after discharge varied and uncertainty about the future and their cancer had an impact upon this. Recovery was made easier through the follow-up clinic. Patients required reassurances that their experiences were valid and also wanted reassurances about their cancer. Conclusion. Critical care causes various difficulties for patients that may impinge on recovery. Incorporating patients into the design process helps identify needs more closely. Follow-up proved beneficial and highlighted the role nurses have in improving patient experiences after discharge from critical care. Nurses should be vigilant for both immediate and longer-term needs. Relevance to clinical practice. This research into nurse-led follow-up clinics after critical care highlights an important, and often neglected, part of the critical illness continuum. Attending such clinics may help reassure patients after discharge from critical care.",0
537,"Background: The intensive care environment and experiences during admission can negatively impact patient and family outcomes and can complicate recovery both in hospital and after discharge. While their perspectives based on intimate experiences of the environment could help inform design improvements, patients and their families are typically not involved in design processes. Rather than designing the environment around the needs of the patients, emphasis has traditionally been placed on clinical and economic efficiencies. Objective: The main objective was to inform design of an optimised intensive care bedspace by developing an understanding of how patients and their families experience the intensive care environment and its impact on recovery. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted with data collected in interviews with 17 intensive care patients and seven family members at a large cardiothoracic specialist hospital, analysed using a framework approach. Results: Participants described the intensive care as a noisy, bright, confronting and scary environment that prevented sleep and was suboptimal for recovery. Bedspaces were described as small and cluttered, with limited access to natural light or cognitive stimulation. The limited ability to personalise the environment and maintain connections with family and the outside world was considered especially problematic. Conclusions: Intensive care patients described features of the current environment they considered problematic and potentially hindering their recovery. The perspective of patients and their families can be utilised by researchers and developers to improve the design and function of the intensive care environment. This can potentially improve patient outcomes and help deliver more personalised and effective care to this vulnerable patient population and their families.

538,"The management of ventilated patients on intensive care has, at its core, a care bundle; an evidence based group of actions designed to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. One of these is the daily cessation of sedation medication to expedite weaning from ventilatory support. A reflection-on-action exercise was carried out when a spinally injured patient became physically active during a sedation hold. This was attributed to hyperactive delirium. The concern was the conflict between providing evidence based Intensive Care Unit (ICU) therapy care and maintaining spinal immobility. Reflection on this incident led to a literature search for guidance on the likelihood of delirium causing secondary spinal injury in patients with unstable fractures. There was plentiful research on delirium and its consequences but very little examining the link between spinal injury and delirium. In order to be able to provide evidence-based care to future trauma patients the research supporting spinal immobilisation was also examined. The research showed that compliance with ventilator care bundles reduced the risks of acquiring ventilator-associated pneumonia. Research surrounding spinal immobilisation was conflicting and there were no studies linking the consequences of immobilised patients experiencing hyperactive delirium. Through a case study approach the research was reviewed in relation to a particular patient and although literature was lacking some implications for practice could be identified to promote the best possible outcomes. Sedation cessation episodes are an essential part of patient care on intensive care. For spinally injured patients' these may need to be modified to sedation reductions to prevent sudden wakening and uncontrolled movement should the patient be experiencing hyperactive delirium. This case study clearly highlights the need for further research in this area as the consequences of both ventilator associated pneumonia and extending spinal injuries is costly for both patients and hospitals.

539,"Aims. To investigate patients' experiences of technology in an adult intensive care unit. Background. Technology is fundamental to support physical recovery from critical illness in Intensive Care Units. As well as physical corollaries, psychological disturbances are reported in critically ill patients at all stages of their illness and recovery. Nurses play a key role in the physical and psychological care of patients;, however, there is a suggestion in the literature that the presence of technology may dehumanise patient care and distract the nurse from attending to patients psychosocial needs. Little attention has been paid to patients' perceptions of receiving care in a technological environment. Design. This study was informed by Heideggerian phenomenology. Methods. The research took place in 2009-2011 in a university hospital in England. Nineteen participants who had been patients in ICU were interviewed guided by an interview topic prompt list. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Van Manen's framework. Findings. Participants described technology and care as inseparable and presented their experiences as a unified encounter. The theme 'Getting on with it' described how participants endured technology by 'Being Good' and 'Being Invisible'. 'Getting over it' described why participants endured technology by 'Bowing to Authority' and viewing invasive technologies as a 'Necessary Evil'. Conclusion. Patients experienced technology and care as a series of paradoxical relationships: alienating yet reassuring, uncomfortable yet comforting, impersonal yet personal. By maintaining a close and supportive presence and providing personal comfort and care nurses may minimize the invasive and isolating potential of technology.",0
540,"Purpose: The study aimed to understand the delirium experience of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods: We performed a qualitative study using Colaizzi's phenomenological method. Eleven patients, who experienced delirium according to the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU, participated after transferring to general wards from the ICU. Individual in-depth semi-structured interviews ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours in length were conducted between November 2018 and August 2019. Results: Nine themes and four theme clusters emerged. The four theme clusters were: 1) ""Overwhelmed by fear,"" which describes the experience of a patient close to death and the feeling of difficulty in understanding disorganized thinking; 2) ""Anxious about not understanding the situation,"" which means that patients' sense of time and space were disordered in the ICU; 3) ""Being deserted,"" which indicates the feeling of being separated from others and yourself; and 4) ""Resistance to protect my dignity,"" which indicates that the dignity and autonomy of an individual in the patient's position at the ICU, are ignored. Conclusion: Nursing interventions are needed that would enable patients to maintain orientation and self-esteem in the ICU. In addition, healthcare providers need to provide information about the unfamiliar environment in the ICU in advance.",0
541,"Purpose: Postoperative delirium is the most well-known form of postoperative cognitive impairment in all patient groups, especially in the elderly. Delirium is a syndrome that causes serious consequences, increasing mortality and morbidity rates and extending the length of hospital stay. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC). Method: One hundred twelve patients who were hospitalized for a surgical operation in the orthopedics, neurosurgery, and general surgery clinic of a state hospital for 3 months were evaluated concurrently (and independently for delirium). Patients were observed by clinical nurses 3 times over a 24-h period. The presence of delirium was diagnosed by 2 neurologists according to DSM-IV criteria. Student's t test, the chi(2) test, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used, and construct validity, intrascale factor analysis, interrater reliability, and specificity and sensitivity (ROC) analyses were performed for descriptive analysis. SPSS 25.0 and MedCalc18.6 were used for statistical analysis. Results: Delirium was detected in 28 patients according to the Nu-DESC. The ICC (intraclass correlation) is 0.97 in the 95% confidence interval from 0.96 to 0.98 for agreement between nurses and neurologists for the total Nu-DESC score. Weighted kappa rates were between 0.78 and 0.92. In the ROC analysis of the Nu-DESC scale, the optimum cutoff value calculated for the 1,344 observations and 112 patients was determined as >1 according to the maximum sensitivity and the specific situation. Sensitivity at the cut-off point was 92.27; specificity was determined as 92.72. The Youden index was found to be J = 0.845 (0 < J = 0.845 < 1). Conclusion: We believe that Turkish translation of Nu-DESC is valid and reliable for clinicians, nurses, and researchers and will contribute to delirium studies.",0
542,"Delirium is an acute disorder affecting up to 80% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. It is associated with a 10-fold increase in cognitive impairment, triples the rate of in-hospital mortality, and costs $164 billion annually. Delirium acutely affects attention and global cognitive function with fluctuating symptoms caused by underlying organic etiologies. Early detection is crucial because the longer a patient experiences delirium the worse it becomes and the harder it is to treat. Currently, identification is through intermittent clinical assessment using standardized tools, like the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU. Such tools work well in clinical research but do not translate well into clinical practice because they are subjective, intermittent and have low sensitivity. As such, healthcare providers using these tools fail to recognize delirium symptoms as much as 80% of the time. Delirium-related biochemical derangement leads to electrical changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns followed by behavioral signs and symptoms. However, continuous EEG monitoring is not feasible due to cost and need for skilled interpretation. Studies using limited-lead EEG show large differences between patients with and without delirium while discriminating delirium from other causes. The Ceribell is a limited-lead device that analyzes EEG. If it is capable of detecting delirium, it would provide an objective physiological monitor to identify delirium before symptom onset. This pilot study was designed to explore relationships between Ceribell and delirium status. Completion of this study will provide a foundation for further research regarding delirium status using the Ceribell data.",0
543,"Restraint has been used within health care settings for many centuries. Initially physical restraint (PR) was the method of choice, in present times. Within critical care units PR and chemical restraint are used, frequently in tandem. Restraint is not a benign intervention and PR specifically is associated with physical and psychological trauma towards those receiving it. Healthcare staff also suffer psychological consequences. This paper has reviewed the literature (using the terms 'physical restraint'; 'hospital'; 'care home critical care'; 'intensive care' attitudes'; 'knowledge' use of'; 'healthcare') to investigate the reasons for the use of restraints, its consequences and the attitudes of healthcare professionals' attitudes towards physical restraint currently present in critical care. Restraint use remains common practice in Critical Care Units (for 'patient safety'), initiated outside of institutional protocols, despite evidence questioning its effectiveness and the resulting harm to patients and staff.",0
544,"Aims and objectivesTo explore the incidence of delirium in cerebrovascular patients admitted in our Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit and analyse the risk factors leading to delirium. BackgroundDelirium is one of the most common mental disorders in general hospitals, but the incidence of different kinds of diseases and studies varies. Cerebrovascular patients in our Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit are high-risk groups for delirium; identifying risk factors for delirium and taking early interventions are crucial for patient prognosis. DesignA prospective study. MethodsA convenience sampling method was used to collect data from 128 patients in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China, between May 2016-January 2017. Researchers used Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (Chinese version) to assess each patient's delirium statement twice a day at regular times. We also collected other independent data variables and followed up the short-term clinical outcomes daily. ResultsOn the basis of Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit evaluation, patients were divided into a delirium group and a nondelirium group. The prevalence of delirium among the 128 patients was 42.2%. Multivariate analysis showed that severity of illness, fever, the use of physical restraints and sleep deprivation were independent predictors of delirium in cerebrovascular patients in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit. ConclusionsCerebrovascular patients in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit with a critical condition, fever or use of physical restraints or experiencing sleep deprivation were more prone to delirium. Relevance to clinical practiceCerebrovascular patients in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit showed a high incidence of delirium. There are many risk factors leading to delirium, some of which are independent predictors of intensive care delirium. Patients with delirium will suffer various adverse effects upon their short-term clinical outcomes. Therefore, nurses should pay close attention to changes in a patient's mental state and learn about the risk factors associated with delirium, in order to be able to take early measures to prevent delirium.",0
545,"Aim (a) To understand patients' lived experience at intensive care unit (ICU) discharge and (b) to evaluate the impact of a nursing empowerment intervention (NEI) on patients' anxiety and depression levels at ICU discharge.

Participants will be patients from three university hospitals who will be selected by purposive sampling. Data will be gathered through in-depth interviews and analysed using content analysis. The qualitative data obtained will be employed to develop the nursing intervention. Subsequently, a multicenter, parallel-group, experimental pre-test/post-test design with a control group will be used to measure the effectiveness of the nursing empowerment intervention in the quantitative phase by means of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Simple random probabilistic sampling will include 172 patients in this phase.",0
547,"Objectives: The Society of Critical Care Medicine recommends routine delirium monitoring, based on data in critically ill patients without primary neurologic injury. We sought to answer whether there are valid and reliable tools to monitor delirium in neurocritically ill patients and whether delirium is associated with relevant clinical outcomes (e.g., survival, length of stay, functional independence, cognition) in this population. Data Sources: We systematically reviewed Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, and PubMed. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Inclusion criteria allowed any study design investigating delirium monitoring in neurocritically ill patients (e.g., neurotrauma, ischemic, and/or hemorrhagic stroke) of any age. We extracted data relevant to delirium tool sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, interrater reliability, and associated clinical outcomes. Data Synthesis: Among seven prospective cohort studies and a total of 1,173 patients, delirium was assessed in neurocritically patients using validated delirium tools after considering primary neurologic diagnoses and associated complications, finding a pooled prevalence rate of 12-43%. When able to compare against a common reference standard, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, the test characteristics showed a sensitivity of 62-76%, specificity of 74-98%, positive predictive value of 63-91%, negative predictive value of 70-94%, and reliability kappa of 0.64-0.94. Among four studies reporting multivariable analyses, delirium in neurocritically patients was associated with increased hospital length of stay (n = 3) and ICU length of stay (n = 1), as well as worse functional independence (n = 1) and cognition (n = 2), but not survival. Conclusions: These data from studies of neurocritically ill patients demonstrate that patients with primary neurologic diagnoses can meet diagnostic criteria for delirium and that delirious features may predict relevant untoward clinical outcomes. There is a need for ongoing investigations regarding delirium in these complicated neurocritically ill patients.",0
548,"Objective: To identify, in the scientific literature, real and illusory perceptions of adult patients in induced coma. Methods: This is an integrative review of 15 primary studies from the Medline, Web of Science, LILACS, CINAHL and SCOPUS databases. Results: The main memories reported after induced coma were thirst, cold, and pain. In some studies, patients reported they were unable to tell whether they were awake or dreaming, whether it was real or unreal. Satisfactory memories were reported by patients related to the care received and the use of bedside journals. Conclusion: Evidence showed a number of studies aiming to identify delirium, but without a focus on analyzing real or illusory perceptions of patients after induced coma. Thus, this integrative review identified scientific evidence of memories related to perceptions of sedated patients in the intensive care unit.",0
549,"Background: High prevalence rates of delirium have been found in intensive care units (ICUs), ranging from 20% to 80%. The development of delirium may prolong length of stay, impair cognition, and result in placement in a nursing home for thepatient. Purpose: There is a lack of research focused on the aging population, so the purpose of this study was to establish the incidence rate of delirium among ICU elderly patients and to identify its risk factors. Methods: An observational design with repeated measures was used. Subjects older than 65 years who had been admitted to the ICU within 24 hours were recruited. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale were used twice a day to identify subjects experiencing delirium by RA. The demographic data, history of illness, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, and laboratory data of the participants were recorded. Results: Ninety participants were included from a medical ICU. The incidence rate of delirium was 75.6% (n = 68). Average age was 78.28 7.6 years; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores ranged from 7 to 35. Most participants were diagnosed with respiratory failure (73.3%), and 86.76% of participantsdeveloped delirium within 24 hours. The most frequently experienced type of delirium was the mixed subtype (47.05%); the second most frequently experienced was hypoactive next. The risk factors were analyzed using logistic regression. The numberof anesthetic analgesics used, total number of medications prescribed, duration of dehydration, use of corticosteroids before admissions, and shock were identified and explained 31.3% of variance. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Delirium is a severe problem among elderly patients in the ICU. Healthcare professionals should pay more attention to elderly patients at greater risk for experiencing delirium.",0
550,"Objectives: Delirium is a common acute cognitive impairment syndrome among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. This study was aimed to investigate the incidence, risk factors, and cumulative risk of delirium among ICU patients. Methods: A case-control study including clinical records of 452 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU and Richmond Agitation -Sedation Scale. Results: We found that 163 out of the 452 patients (36.1%) had delirium. Multivariate analysis showed that use of sedatives, length of ICU hospitalization, and physical restraint were independent risk factors for delirium. The additive effect of all three factors resulted to an odds ratio of 30.950. Conclusion: The incidence of delirium remained high. Thus, nurses shall strengthen the monitoring of delirium, regularly access the patient's level of calmness, and limit the use of physical restraint. (C) 2019 Chinese Nursing Association.

551,"BackgroundDespite the fact that a lot of patients consider their discharge from hospitals as a positive sign of progress towards regained health, many of them start suffering from physical, psychological and social problems after discharge from intensive care units. AimThis study aims to describe the experiences of Jordanian survivors of critical illnesses 3 months after discharge from a hospital intensive care unit. MethodsA descriptive qualitative approach was used to involve 18 Jordanian patients from two hospitals in a major Jordanian city using open-ended interviews. Interview transcripts were analysed using content analysis method. ResultsThree main themes have emerged from the data: (1) new meaning of life; (2) different perspectives on the meaning of life, and (3) struggle for role identity. LimitationThe sample was chosen from one city in Jordan; longitudinal study might help identify the change in patients' experiences over time. ConclusionPatients described the discharge from the intensive care unit as a means of rescue from death; they began to value their spiritual and religious rituals. Negative traumatic experiences hindered the patients' recovery process. During recovery, patients struggled to resume their power and role in family. Implications for Nurses and Health PolicyThis study emphasizes the importance of providing care according to the patient's individual needs, related to their cultural and spiritual milieu; there is a need to develop follow-up services for ICU survivors within a national health policy. Further educational and training programmes in the patient's issues after discharge from hospital are needed. This will definitely help nurses care after this patient group.",0
552,"BackgroundEarly mobilization in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a hotspot. This study aims to provide a bibliometric perspective of the progress in this field. MethodsWe extracted publications on ICU early mobilization published in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2000 to 2021. VOSviewer was used to construct co-occurrence and co-citation relationships for authors, references, and keywords; Citespace was used to visualize knowledge mapping of subject categories, countries, and keywords with the strongest citation bursts. ResultsA total of 4,570 publications were analyzed, with a steady increase in publications in the field of ICU early mobilization. From a macro perspective, research on ICU early mobilization involves multidisciplinary involvement, including critical care medicine, neurology, and nursing; as for the meso perspective, the United States is the major contributor. Needham DM and Schweickert WD are the key researchers in this field. Moreover, the core journal is Critical Care Medicine, with the most publications and citations. The microscopic level, dominated by references and keywords, illustrates that the hotspot and frontier of research on ICU early mobilization focus on ICU-acquired weakness, delirium, the prognosis of critical illness, and severe COVID-19. ConclusionThis study presents a research landscape of ICU early mobilization from different perspectives. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the current state of research in critical care medicine and provide the available information for future research ideas.",0
553,"BACKGROUND Patient- and family-centered care permeates critical care where there are often multiple teams involved in management. A method of facilitating information sharing to support shared decision making is essential in appropriately rendering care. This study sought to determine whether incorporating family members on rounds in the intensive care unit (ICU) improves patient and family knowledge and whether doing so improves team time management and satisfaction with the process. METHODS A nonrandomized comparative before-and-after trial of incorporating family members on rounds (July to December 2009 vs January to July 2010) in a single quarternary center's surgical ICU assessed (1) family members' knowledge, (2) nurse's and physician's satisfaction with the intervention, (3) frequency and timing of family meetings, and (4) physician's workflow. RESULTS Intensive care unit demographics and use were similar between time frames. Presurvey (n = 412 family members; 49 nurses) and postsurvey (n = 427 family members; 47 nurses) were coupled with presurvey (n = 5) and postsurvey (n = 6) physicians' informal feedback. Family knowledge of the clinical course and plans increased from 146 (35.4%) of 412 to 374 (87.6%) of 427 (p < 0.0001). Nurses were nearly uniformly satisfied with planned family interaction on rounds (presurvey: 9/49 [18.4%] vs postsurvey: 46/47 [97.9%]; p < 0.0001). Family meetings per week outside of rounds substantially decreased from a mean of 5.3 2.7 to 0.3 0.9; p < 0.001). Goals of therapy including end-of-life care became an element frequently discussed on rounds with families (presurvey: 9.4% +/- 4.7% vs postsurvey: 82.5% +/- 14.8%; p < 0.0001). One intensivist was dissatisfied with the process. CONCLUSION Incorporating family members on rounds in the ICU improves communication and satisfaction and shifts the team's time away from family communication events outside of rounds, condensing most of those activities within the rounding structure. Critical care nurses and intensivists were principally satisfied with the process. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic, level III.",0
554,"Background: Sleep disruption is common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, with reports indicating reduced quality and quantity of sleep in many patients. There is growing evidence that sleep in this setting may be improved. Aim: To describe ICU patients' self-report assessment of sleep, examine the relationship between patients' self-reported sleep and their reported sleep by the bedside nurse, and describe the strategies suggested by patients to promote sleep. Methods: An exploratory descriptive study was undertaken with communicative adult patients consecutively recruited in 2014-2015. Patients reported sleep using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (score range 0-100mm; higher score indicates better sleep quality), with nursing assessment of sleep documented across a five level ordinal variable. Patients were asked daily to describe strategies that helped or hindered their sleep. Ethical approval for the study was gained. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed [median (interquartile range)]; relationships were tested using Spearman's rank correlation and differences assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test; p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Participants (n = 151) were recruited [age: 60 (46-71) years; ICU length of stay 4 (2-9) days] with 356 self-reports of sleep. Median perceived sleep quality was 46 (26-65) mm. A moderate relationship existed between patients' self-assessment and nurses' assessment of sleep (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0.39-0.50; p < 0.001). Strategies identified by patients to improve sleep included adequate pain relief and sedative medication, a peaceful and comfortable environment and physical interventions, e.g. clustering care, ear plugs.",0
555,"Introduction Agitation and violent behaviours are common conditions developed by patients with acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) in intensive care units (ICUs). Healthcare professionals caring for these patients have various tools to manage these behaviours, but lack of a formal protocol to assess and manage them makes caring for these patients a challenge. Moreover, safety may often be compromised for both ICU professionals and patients encountering such situations. The EXperienceS and aTtitudes towards Agitated behaviours in Traumatic brain injury in the Intensive Care unit patients (EXSTATIC) study aims to explore the experiences and attitudes of ICU nurses and other ICU healthcare professionals on the management of agitated behaviours in patients with acute TBI. Methods and analysis EXSTATIC is a multicenter mixed methods convergent study exploring experiences and attitudes of ICU healthcare professionals caring of agitated patients with TBI. The study includes three qualitative methods (observation, semistructured interviews and focus groups) and one quantitative method (retrospective cohort). The integration of the different methods will be done using sequential steps of the research and by the integration of results for each step. Qualitative data will be evaluated following a thematic analysis derived from a grounded theory approach. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative and quantitative results will be combined in a convergent interactive interpretative design. Gender and race perspective will be integrated in collection, analysis and interpretation of data. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Centre integre universitaire de sante et de services sociaux du nord de l'ile de Montreal (CIUSSS-NIM) Research Ethics Board. The findings will be disseminated locally with ICU staff and health managers, international peer-reviewed journals, a PhD dissertation, and national and international conferences. The knowledge derived from this study is key in the development of clinical protocols to manage agitation and related behaviours in patients with TBI and designing further interventional studies targeting this specific problematic.",0
556,"OBJECTIVES: Patients in the pediatric cardiac ICU are frequently exposed to pharmacologic and environmental factors that predispose them to sleep disturbances and may increase the risk of delirium. In this pilot study, we sought to demonstrate the feasibility of actigraphy monitoring in pediatric cardiac ICU patients to investigate the association between sleep characteristics and delirium development. DESIGN: Prospective observational pilot study. SETTING: Pediatric cardiac ICU in an academic children's hospital in the United States. PATIENTS: Children admitted to the pediatric cardiac ICU after cardiac surgery. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen enrolled patients wore actigraphy watches that provided data for a total of 63 pediatric cardiac ICU days. The median pediatric cardiac ICU length of stay was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-3 d). The median sleep episode among all patients was 37 minutes in duration (interquartile range, 18-46 min), and the longest sleep episode was a median of 117 minutes (interquartile range, 69-144 min). Sixty-one percent of patients (95% CI, 36-83%) screened positive for delirium at least once during admission, and the median number of delirious days among those who were positive was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-3 d). The median percent sleep time was 43% for delirious patients and 49% for those with no delirium, with similar median sleep and longest sleep episodes. The median ratio of daytime activity/24-hr activity was 54% (interquartile range, 49-59%) in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Actigraphy monitoring in conjunction with delirium screening is feasible in infants and children admitted to the pediatric cardiac ICU after cardiac surgery. Our data suggest that most children in the pediatric cardiac ICU experience severe sleep disruption and delirium is common. These pilot data provide important insights for the design of a large-scale observational study to investigate potential causal relationships between sleep disruption and delirium in the pediatric cardiac ICU.",0

558,"Purpose: To characterize the pharmacogenomic response of low-dose haloperidol for delirium treatment in critically ill adults. Materials and methods: Single-center, pilot study of a convenience sample of ICU adults with delirium treated with low-dose IV haloperidol. Patients were evaluated for delirium with the ICDSC every 8 h. Serum haloperidol concentrations were collected on ICU days 2-6, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genotypeswere characterized and patients were categorized as extensive (EM), intermediate (IM) or poor metabolizers (PM). Results: The 22 patients (median age 67 [IQR 48,77] years; median APACHE III 81[IQR 54,181]; CYP2D6 [EM= 12, IM= 7, PM= 3], CYP3A [EM= 18, IM= 4]) received a median [IQR] daily haloperidol dose of 3.0 [2.4, 4.5] mg. After adjusting for age, SOFA, and ICU day, neither an association between CYP2D6 (IM p =.67/PM p =.25) or CYP3A4 (IMp=.44) metabolizer status and serumhaloperidol concentrationswas found. After adjusting for age, SOFA, and ICU day, neither an association between daily haloperidol dose (p=.77) or ICDSC score (p =.13) and serum haloperidol concentrations was found. No patient experienced QTc interval prolongation (=500 ms). Conclusions: This pilot study, the first to evaluate the pharmacogenomic response of low-dose haloperidol when used to treat deliriumin the ICU, suggests CYP2D6/CYP3A4metabolizer status does not affect the serumhaloperidol concentrations.

559,"Objectives To understand why critical care clinicians still implement physical restraints, to prevent unplanned extubation and to explore the driving factors influencing the decision-making of physical restraints use. Design A qualitative descriptive design was used. The data were collected through one-to-one, semistructured interviews and analysed through the framework of thematic analysis. Participants and setting The study was conducted from December 2019 to May 2020 at one general intensive care unit (ICU) and one emergency ICU in a general tertiary hospital with 3200 beds in Hangzhou, China. The sampling strategy was combined maximum variation sampling and criterion sampling. Results A total of 14 clinicians participated in the study. The reason why critical care clinicians implemented physical restraints to prevent unplanned extubation was that the tense healthcare climate was caused by family members' rejection of mismatched expectations. As unplanned extubation was highly likely to create medical disputes, hospitals placed excessive emphasis on unplanned extubation, which resulted in a lack of analysis of the cause of unplanned extubation and strict measures for dealing with unplanned extubation. The shortage of nursing human resources, unsuitable ward environments, intensivists' attitudes, timely extubation for intensivists, nurse experiences and the patient's possibility of unplanned extubation all contributed to the decision-making resulting in the use of physical restraints. Conclusions Although nurses played a crucial role in the decision-making process of using physical restraints, changing the healthcare climate and the hospital management mode for unplanned extubation are fundamental measures to reduce physical restraints use.",0
560,"Rationale: Studies suggest that reduced cerebral perfusion may contribute to delirium development in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, evidence is limited because of factors including small sample size and limited inclusion of covariates. Objectives: To assess the feasibility of a multicenter prospective observational study using a multimodal data collection platform. Feasibility was assessed by enrollment, data-capture, and follow-up rates. The full study will aim to assess the association between noninvasively derived surrogate markers of cerebral perfusion, delirium development, and long-term cognitive outcomes in critically ill patients. Methods: Adult patients in the ICU were enrolled if they had shock and/or respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for >24 hours. For the first 72 hours, a near-infrared spectroscopic sensor was placed on the forehead to continuously monitor regional cerebral oxygenation (rSo(2)) and high-frequency (1 Hz) vital signs were concurrently captured via an arterial line. Cerebral perfusion was estimated using three variables, including mean rSo(2), duration of disturbed autoregulation, and time/magnitude away from optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP). Patients were screened for delirium in the ICU and ward daily for up to 30 days. Cognitive function was assessed 3 and 12 months after ICU admission to identify cognitive impairment. Results: Fifty-nine patients were enrolled across four sites in 1 year. Data-capture rates varied across modalities but exceeded 80% for rSo(2), blood gas, and delirium data capture. Vital-sign capture and 3-month follow-up rates were lower at 53% and 55%, respectively. Eighty-three percent (49 of 59) of patients experienced delirium, with a median severity of 0.56 in the ICU. Mean physiological (+/- standard deviation) values were: rSo(2) (70.4%+/- 7.0%), heart rate (83.9 +/- 16.45 beats/min), MAP (76.4 +/- 12.8 mm Hg), peripheral oxygenation saturation (96.5%+/- 2.1%), proportion of recording time spent with disturbed autoregulation (10.1%+/- 7.3%) and proportion of area under the curve outside optimal MAP (39.6%+/- 22.4%). Thirty-two (54%) individuals had cerebral autoregulation curves where a targeted optimal MAP was identified. Barriers to data collection included missing vital-sign data and low follow-up rates. Conclusions: Given our current protocol, a multicenter study examining the association between cerebral oxygenation, delirium, and long-term cognitive impairment is not feasible. However, by performing an early assessment of feasibility, we identified strategies to increase capture rates to ensure success as the study begins the next phase of study recruitment.",0
561,"Objectives: To determine if a quality improvement intervention improves sleep and delirium/cognition. Design: Observational, pre-post design. Setting: A tertiary academic hospital in the United States. Patients: 300 medical ICU patients. Interventions: This medical ICU-wide project involved a ""usual care"" baseline stage, followed by a quality improvement stage incorporating multifaceted sleep-promoting interventions implemented with the aid of daily reminder checklists for ICU staff. Measurements and Main Results: Primary ICU outcomes were perceived sleep quality and noise ratings (measured on a 0-100 scale using the valid and reliable Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire) and delirium/coma-free days. Secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay and mortality. Post-ICU measures of cognition and perceived sleep quality were evaluated in an ICU patient subset. During the baseline and sleep quality improvement stages, there were 122 and 178 patients, respectively, with more than one night in the ICU, accounting for 634 and 826 patient-days. Within the groups, 78 (63.9%) and 83 (46.6%) patients received mechanical ventilation. Over the 826 patient-day quality improvement period, checklist item completion rates ranged from 86% to 94%. In multivariable regression analysis of the quality improvement vs. baseline stages, improvements in overall Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire sleep quality ratings did not reach statistical significance, but there were significant improvements in daily noise ratings (mean +/- SD: 65.9 +/- 26.6 vs. 60.5 +/- 26.3, p = 0.001), incidence of delirium/coma (odds ratio: 0.46; 95% confidence interval,.0.23-0.89; p = 0.02), and daily delirium/coma-free status (odds ratio: 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.58; p = 0.03). Improvements in secondary ICU outcomes and post-ICU outcomes did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: An ICU-wide quality improvement intervention to improve sleep and delirium is feasible and associated with significant improvements in perceived nighttime noise, incidence of delirium/coma, and daily delirium/coma-free status. Improvement in perceived sleep quality did not reach statistical significance. (Crit Care Med 2013; 41:800-809)",0
563,"Background: Delirium research is poorly studied in postacute care, a growing setting due to aging populations, as well as in dementia, a critical risk factor for delirium and particularly prevalent in postacute care. We investigated risk factors for delirium and its outcomes in older adults with and without dementia admitted to a subacute care unit (SCU) after exacerbated chronic conditions. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study including patients >= 65 years old admitted to an SCU for 12 months. We collected demographics, comprehensive geriatric assessments, and presence of dementia and delirium at admission. Outcomes included discharge to previous living situation, mortality, and functional evolution. Due to the high prevalence of dementia, a subgroup analysis was performed to investigate specific risk factors for delirium and related outcomes. Results: Of 909 patients (mean age [+/- SD] 85.8 +/- 6.7; 60% women, 47.5% with dementia), 352 (38.7%) developed delirium. The main risk factor for delirium was dementia (HR [95% CI] 5.2 [3.5-7.7]); age, functional status, and urinary tract infections were also independently associated with delirium. In dementia patients, only age (HR [95% CI] 1.0 [1.004-1.1]) and being male (HR [95% CI] 1.7 [1.04-2.6]) were associated with delirium. Delirium was associated with greater mortality (10.8 vs. 3.9%; p < 0.001) and greater functional decline in the entire sample (-12.3 vs. -6.4 Barthel index points; p < 0.001). In the dementia subgroup, patients with delirium experienced greaterfunctional loss (p = 0.013) and less functional recovery (p = 0.025). Conclusions: In older patients admitted to postacute care, dementia is the main risk factor for delirium, and delirium carries worse clinical and functional outcomes. In patients with dementia, delirium is also relevant, since it entails a functional loss at admission and lower functional recovery. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel",0

565,"Introduction: Appropriate management of analgo-sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with improved patient outcomes. Our objectives were: a) to describe utilization of analgo-sedation regimens and strategies (assessment using scales, protocolized analgo-sedation and daily sedation interruption (DSI)) and b) to describe and compare perceptions challenging utilization of these strategies, amongst physicians and nurses. Methods: In the 101 adult ICUs in Belgium, we surveyed all physicians and a sample of seven nurses per ICU. A multidisciplinary team designed a survey tool based on a previous qualitative study and a literature review. The latter was available in paper (for nurses essentially) and web based (for physicians). Topics addressed included: practices, perceptions regarding recommended strategies and demographics. Pre-testing involved respondents' debriefings and test re-test reliability. Four reminders were sent. Results: Response rate was 60% (898/1,491 participants) representing 94% (95/101) of all hospitals. Protocols were available to 31% of respondents. Validated scales to monitor pain in patients unable to self-report and to monitor sedation were available to 11% and 75% of respondents, respectively. Frequency of use of sedation scales varied (never to hourly). More physicians than nurses agreed with statements reporting benefits of sedation scales, including: increased autonomy for nurses (82% versus 68%, P < 0.001), enhancement of their role (84% versus 66%, P < 0.001), aid in monitoring administration of sedatives (83% versus 68%, P < 0.001), and cost control (54% versus 29%, P < 0.001). DSI was used in less than 25% of patients for 75% of respondents. More nurses than physicians indicated DSI is contra-indicated in hemodynamic instability (66% versus 53%, P < 0.001) and complicated weaning from mechanical ventilation (47% versus 29%, P < 0.001). Conversely, more physicians than nurses indicated contra-indications including: seizures (56% versus 40%, P < 0.001) and refractory intracranial hypertension (90% versus 83%, P < 0.001). More nurses than physicians agreed with statements reporting DSI impairs patient comfort (60% versus 37%, P < 0.001) and increases complications such as self-extubation (82% versus 69%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Current analgo-sedation practices leave room for improvement. Physicians and nurses meet different challenges in using appropriate analgo-sedation strategies. Implementational interventions must be tailored according to profession.",0
566,"BACKGROUND: Delirium has been the most frequent neuropsychiatric complication in patients with advanced cancer. This exploratory study aimed to determine the proportion of patients who were able to recall their experience of delirium and the level of distress experienced by patients, family caregivers, and healthcare professionals. METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer who had completely recovered from an acute delirium episode, had Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale score <13, and had a family caregiver present during the delirium were studied. Patients were given the Delirium Experience Questionnaire. Patients' and family caregivers' demographics, and the frequency and distress associated with different delirium symptoms were also collected. Bedside nurses and palliative care specialists reported the frequency of recalled delirium symptoms and their distress score. RESULTS: A total of 99 patient/family caregiver dyads participated in the study. The main identified causes for delirium were opioids, infection, brain metastases, hypercalcemia, and dehydration. There were 73 patients (74%) who remembered the episode of being delirious, with 59 of 73 patients (81%) reporting the experience as distressing (median distress level of 3). The median overall delirium distress score was higher in family caregivers (median, 3; 25%-75% quartile, 2-4) than in patients (median, 2; 25%-75% quartile, 0-3) (P = .0004). Bedside nurses and palliative care specialists expressed low median overall delirium distress scores (median, 0; 25%-75% quartile 0-1). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with advanced cancer recalled their experience of delirium, causing moderate to severe distress in both patients and family caregivers. Appropriate interventions to reduce this distress are needed. Cancer 2009;115:2004-12. (C) 2009 American Cancer Society.",0
567,"Background: There is a growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions to prevent or treat delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). Efforts to improve the conduct of delirium RCTs are underway, but none address issues related to statistical analysis. The purpose of this review is to evaluate heterogeneity in the design and analysis of delirium outcomes and advance methodological recommendations for delirium RCTs in the ICU. Methods: Relevant databases, including PubMed and Embase, were searched with no restrictions on language or publication date; the search was conducted on July 8, 2019. RCTs conducted on adult ICU patients with delirium as the primary outcome were included where trial results were available. Data on frequency and duration of delirium assessments, delirium outcome definitions, and statistical methods were independently extracted in duplicate. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020141204). Results: Among 65 eligible RCTs, 44 (68%) targeted the prevention of delirium. The duration of follow-up varied, with 31 (48%) RCTs having <= 7 days of follow-up, and only 24 (37%) conducting delirium assessments after ICU discharge. The incidence of delirium was the most common outcome (50 RCTs, 77%) for which 8 unique statistical methods were applied. The most common method, applied to 51 of 56 (91%) delirium incidence outcomes, was the two-sample test comparing the proportion of patients who ever experienced delirium. In the presence of censoring of patients at ICU discharge or death, this test may be misleading. The impact of censoring was also not considered in most analyses of the duration of delirium, as evaluated in 24 RCTs, with 21 (88%) delirium duration outcomes analyzed using a non-parametric test or two-sample t test. Composite outcomes (e.g., rank-based delirium- and coma-free days), used in 11 (17%) RCTs, seldom explicitly defined how ICU discharge, and death were incorporated into the definition and were analyzed using non-parametric tests (11 of 13 (85%) composite outcomes). Conclusions: To improve delirium RCTs, outcomes should be explicitly defined. To account for censoring due to ICU discharge or death, survival analysis methods should be considered for delirium incidence and duration outcomes; non-parametric tests are recommended for rank-based delirium composite outcomes.",0
568,"The ""very old intensive care patients"" (abbreviated to VOPs; greater than 80 years old) are probably the fastest expanding subgroup of all intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Up until recently most ICU physicians have been reluctant to admit these VOPs. The general consensus was that there was little survival to gain and the incremental life expectancy of ICU admission was considered too small. Several publications have questioned this belief, but others have confirmed the poor long-term mortality rates in VOPs. More appropriate triage (resource limitation enforced decisions), admission decisions based on shared decision-making and improved prediction models are also needed for this particular patient group. Here, an expert panel proposes a research agenda for VOPs for the coming years.",0
569,"Background: Agitation and delirium are common in mechanically ventilated adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients and may contribute to delayed extubation times. Difficult-to-wean ICU patients have been associated with an increased risk of longer ICU length of stays and mortality. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the evidence of dexmedetomidine facilitating successful mechanical ventilation extubation in difficult-to-wean ICU patients and clinical outcomes. Methods: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Global Health, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Clinical Trial Registries, and the Health Technology Assessment Database from inception to December 5, 2019. Randomized controlled trials evaluating dexmedetomidine with the intended purpose to facilitate mechanical ventilation liberation in adult ICU patients (>= 18 years) experiencing extubation failure were included. The primary outcome of time to extubation was evaluated using the weighted mean difference (WMD), with a random effects model. Secondary analyses included hospital and ICU length of stay, in-hospital mortality, hypotension, and bradycardia. Results: A total of 6 trials (n = 306 patients) were included. Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the time to extubation (WMD: -11.61 hours, 95% CI: -16.5 to -6.7,P= .005) and ICU length of stay (WMD: -3.04 days; 95% CI: -4.66 to -1.43). Hypotension risk was increased with dexmedetomidine (risk ratio [RR]: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.05-2.51), but there was no difference in bradycardia risk (RR: 3.98, 95% CI: 0.70-22.78). No differences were observed in mortality rates (RR: 1.30, 95% CI: 0.45-3.75) or hospital length of stay (WMD: -2.67 days; 95% CI: -7.73 to 2.39). Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine was associated with a significant reduction in the time to extubation and shorter ICU stay in difficult-to-wean ICU patients. Although hypotension risk was increased with dexmedetomidine, no differences in other clinical outcomes were observed.",0
570,"Background:The workload is the impinged stress due to several inter-related factors, including the competence of the intensive care unit nurse.

Data were collected through in-depth personal interviews and with other instruments. The obtained data were analyzed with SPSS 18.0 and MAXQDA plus10. Results:The workload of intensive care nurses was 315.8 per minute and the mean TISS 28 score was as high as 65.00. The in-depth interviews with intensive care nurses revealed that participants experienced professional stress due to high workload and went through psychological changes. Conclusion:The study findings demonstrate that psychological symptoms seen in intensive care nurses relate to a high workload.

571,"Objectives: Patients' experience of psychological distress in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with adverse effects, reduced satisfaction, and delayed physical and psychological recovery. There are no specific guidelines for the assessment and management of acute psychological distress during hospitalisation in the ICU. We reviewed existing tools for the assessment of acute psychological distress in ICU patients, examined evidence on their metric properties, and identified potential gaps and methodological considerations. Method: A scoping review based on literature searches (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica Database, PsycINFO, Scopus, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, Dissertations and Theses Global, and Google Scholar) and predefined eligibility criteria was conducted as per current scoping review guidelines. Findings: Overall, 14 assessment tools were identified having been developed in diverse ICU settings. The identified tools assess mainly anxiety and depressive symptoms and ICU stressors, and investigators have reported various validity and reliability metrics. It was unclear whether available tools can be used in specific groups, such as noncommunicative patients and patients with delirium, brain trauma, stroke, sedation, and cognitive impairments. Conclusion: Available tools have methodological limitations worth considering in future investigations. Given the high prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in ICU survivors, rigorously exploring the metric integrity of available tools used for anxiety, depressive, and psychological distress symptom assessment in the vulnerable ICU population is a practice and research priority. Relevance to clinical practice: These results have implications for the selection and implementation of psychological distress assessment methods as a means for promoting meaningful patient-centred clinical outcomes and humanising ICU care experiences.

572,"Background: Prolonged hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) can impose long-term psychological effects on patients. One of the most significant psychological effects from prolonged hospitalization is delirium. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of prolonged hospitalization of patients and subsequent delirium in the intensive care unit. Patients and Methods: This conventional content analysis study was conducted in the General Intensive Care Unit of the Shariati Hospital of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, from the beginning of 2013 to 2014. All prolonged hospitalized patients and their families were eligible participants. From the 34 eligible patients and 63 family members, the final numbers of actual patients and family members were 9 and 16, respectively. Several semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to-face with patients and their families in a private room and data were gathered. Results: Two main themes from two different perspectives emerged, 'patients' perspectives' (experiences during ICU hospitalization) and 'family members' perspectives' (supportive-communicational experiences). The main results of this study focused on delirium, Patients' findings were described as pleasant and unpleasant, factual and delusional experiences. Conclusions: Family members are valuable components in the therapeutic process of delirium. Effective use of family members in the delirium caring process can be considered to be one of the key non-medical nursing components in the therapeutic process.",0
573,"Background: Delirium is one of the most common complications of cardiac surgery, and only a small percentage of nurses are able to diagnose and manage it. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Scenario-Based Learning (SBL) on the performance of nurses in the management of delirium in Cardiovascular Intensive Care Units (CICUs). Materials and Methods: A quasi-experimental research with a pretest-post-test design was conducted on 36 nurses of the cardiac surgery ICUs of Isfahan's therapeutic-educational center from October 2019 to January 2020. The SBL? was held in the form of a 2-day workshop. The study data collection tools included a demographic questionnaire, researcher-made knowledge questionnaire, and performance checklist. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics (frequency, mean, and standard deviation), and inferential statistics (repeated measures one-way analysis of variance ANOVA and Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD post hoc test). Results: The mean score of performance of nurses differed significantly different between the three study stages (before the intervention, immediately, and 3 weeks after the intervention) (F-2,F-30 = 139.41; p < 0.001). LSD post hoc test showed that the mean score of performance was significantly higher immediately after the training program compared to before the intervention and 3 weeks after the SBL (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that SBL? improved the delirium care performance levels of nurses in the cardiac surgery ICU. Thus, it is recommended that SBL be used as a method for training nurses.",0
575,"Objective: Delirium is common during critical illness and associated with adverse outcomes. We compared characteristics and outcomes of delirious and nondelirious patients enrolled in a multicenter trial comparing protocolized sedation with protocolized sedation plus daily sedation interruption.

Interventions: All patients had hourly titration of opioid and benzodiazepine infusions using a validated sedation scale. For patients in the interruption group, infusions were resumed, if indicated, at half of previous doses. Delirium screening occurred daily; positive screening was defined as an Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score of 4 or more at any time. Measurements and Main Results: Delirium was diagnosed in 226 of 420 assessed patients (53.8%). Coma was identified in 32.7% of delirious compared with 22.7% of nondelirious patients (p = 0.03). The median time to onset of delirium was 3.5 days (interquartile range, 2-7), and the median duration of delirium was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-4). Delirious patients were more likely to be male (61.1% vs 46.6%; p = 0.005), have a surgical/trauma diagnosis (21.2% vs 11.0%; p = 0.030), and history of tobacco (31.5% vs 16.2%; p = 0.002) or alcohol use (34.6% vs 20.9%; p = 0.009). Patients with positive delirium screening had longer duration of ventilation (13 vs 7 d; p < 0.001), ICU stay (12 vs 8 d; p < 0.0001), and hospital stay (24 vs 15 d; p < 0.0001). Delirious patients were more likely to be physically restrained (86.3% vs 76.7%; p = 0.014) and undergo tracheostomy (34.6% vs 15.5%; p< 0.0001). Antecedent factors independently associated with delirium onset were restraint use (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.33-2.63; p = 0.0003), antipsychotic administration (hazard ratio, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.005-2.767; p = 0.047), and midazolam dose (hazard ratio, 0.998; 95% CI, 0.997-1.0; p = 0.049). There was no difference in delirium prevalence or duration between the interruption and control groups. Conclusion: In mechanically ventilated adults, delirium was common and associated with longer duration of ventilation and hospitalization. Physical restraint was most strongly associated with delirium.",0
576,"Objective: To investigate the prevalence and associated factors of delirium in critically ill patients during an intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Methods: We investigated 103 of 172 patients admitted consecutively to a university-based 20-bed ICU in a 3-month period. Six ICU physicians, who were familiar with the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), assessed patient delirium daily. Patient demographics, diagnosis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, mechanical ventilation and maximum serum C-reactive protein (max-CRP) level during the ICU stay (max-CRP) were compared between patients who developed delirium and those who did not. Results: Twenty-one (20%) of 103 patients and 13(76%) of 17 mechanically ventilated patients developed delirium. APACHE II scores and max-CRP were significantly higher in patients who experienced delirium than in those who did not (P <.001). Use of a mechanical ventilator (P=.002), max-CRP (P=.032) and length of ICU stay (P=.043) were identified as independent associations for delirium development. Conclusions: The prevalence of delirium was 20% in ICU patients and 80% in ventilated patients in a Japanese ICU. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
577,"Background People who are experiencing a period of critical illness frequently experience severe agitation. The presence of agitation can pose risks to the patient, family, and clinical team. Aims and objectives To capture the views and opinions of critical care multidisciplinary teams concerning the approaches in the management of agitation, and to understand and identify the perceived risks and benefits of current management strategies. Design A descriptive qualitative design. Methods Data were gathered using semi-structured interviews with multidisciplinary teams from adult critical care units from one region in the United Kingdom. Findings A total of 19 participants participated between February to September 2017. There were two group interviews (GIs) (n = 12, GI 1 n = 8, GI 2 n = 4) and seven one-to-one interviews, across four hospital organisations with one participant working via an agency. The mean length (+/- SD) of each interview, one to one or group, was 58.86 minutes (5.81 minutes). Three major themes were generated about the complex clinical decision-making required to manage an agitated patient. These themes represented: the burden of care, continuity of clinical decision-making, and uncertainty and indecision experienced by participants. Conclusion Participants described caring for an agitated patient as challenging and stressful. Staff sought clarification on what level of restrictive practice is allowed. Feelings of anxiety and stress generated by the decisions made may have an impact on staff, particularly those who are more inexperienced, which in the longer term could lead to fatigue or moral distress. Relevance to clinical practice. The study has emphasised the challenges faced by multidisciplinary teams and how decision-making may impact on individuals within the team.",0
578,"The aim of this study was to document physicians' perceptions of cancer care for elderly patients within an oncogeriatric coordination pilot unit (UPCOG) created in Paris, France. We focused on how physicians apply new cancer care practices, how they establish new teamwork, and their experience of oncogeriatrics in everyday practice. Qualitative methods were used, including a literature review, observation of working sessions in the oncogeriatric pilot unit, and semi-structured interviews with 28 physicians. The results show how physicians' differing perceptions of geriatric oncology can hinder routine collaboration. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
579,"Background The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) demonstrates good psychometric characteristics in research settings. However, evidence about these characteristics in pragmatic ICU settings is inconsistent. This study evaluated psychometric properties and user-friendliness of the ICDSC when administered by ICU nurses in daily practice. Methods This prospective study included 77 patients from a surgical intensive care unit. To examine the psychometric characteristics, the scores on the ICDSC (performed by bedside nurses) were compared with the scores on the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) (performed by researchers as gold standard). The user-friendliness was evaluated by 34 ICU nurses with a 20-item questionnaire. Results The ICDSC had an area under the curve of 0.843. It showed a good diagnostic accuracy with a sensitivity of 81.0%, a specificity of 87.7%, and a 53.1% positive and 96.4% negative predictive value. The overall Cronbach's alpha coefficient for all ICDSC scores was high (0.839). Overall, ICU nurses experienced the ICDSC as easy-to-use. The scale was usable in most surgical ICU patients. Yet, some nurses (11.8%) had problems to score the items 'inappropriate speech' and 'symptom fluctuation' in intubated patients. Conclusions The ICDSC is a valid and user-friendly tool for delirium screening in daily ICU nursing practice. Yet, some problems were reported in intubated patients. Therefore, validation studies with specific focus on intubated patients are needed.",0
580,"Delirium in the general intensive care unit (ICU) population is common, associated with adverse outcomes and well studied. However, knowledge on delirium in the increasing number of ICU patients with malignancy is scarce. The aim was to assess the frequency of delirium and its impact on resource utilizations and outcomes in ICU patients with malignancy. This retrospective, single-center longitudinal cohort study included all patients with malignancy admitted to ICUs of a University Hospital during one year. Delirium was diagnosed by an Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) score >= 4. Of 488 ICU patients with malignancy, 176/488 (36%) developed delirium. Delirious patients were older (66 [55-72] vs. 61 [51-69] years, p = 0.001), had higher SAPS II (41 [27-68] vs. 24 [17-32], p < 0.001) and more frequently sepsis (26/176 [15%] vs. 6/312 [1.9%], p < 0.001) and/or shock (30/176 [6.1%] vs. 6/312 [1.9%], p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, delirium was independently associated with lower discharge home (OR [95% CI] 0.37 [0.24-0.57], p < 0.001), longer ICU (HR [95% CI] 0.30 [0.23-0.37], p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (HR [95% CI] 0.62 [0.50-0.77], p < 0.001), longer mechanical ventilation (HR [95% CI] 0.40 [0.28-0.57], p < 0.001), higher ICU nursing workload (B [95% CI] 1.92 [1.67-2.21], p < 0.001) and ICU (B [95% CI] 2.08 [1.81-2.38], p < 0.001) and total costs (B [95% CI] 1.44 [1.30-1.60], p < 0.001). However, delirium was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality (OR [95% CI] 2.26 [0.93-5.54], p = 0.074). In conclusion, delirium was a frequent complication in ICU patients with malignancy independently associated with high resource utilizations, however, it was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality.",0
581,"Aims and objectives. This research studied the long term outcome of intensive care delirium defined as mortality and quality of life at three and six months after discharge of the intensive care unit. Background. Delirium in the intensive care unit is known to result in worse outcomes. Cognitive impairment, a longer stay in the hospital or in the intensive care unit and a raised mortality have been reported. Design. A prospective cohort study. Methods. A population of 105 consecutive patients was included during the stay at the intensive care unit in July-August 2006. The population was assessed once a day for delirium using the NEECHAM Confusion Scale and the CAM-ICU. Patients were visited at home by a nurse researcher to assess the quality of life using the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey at three and six months after discharge of the intensive care unit. Delirious and non delirious patients were compared for mortality and quality of life. Results. Compared to the non delirious patients, more delirious patients died. The total study population discharged from the intensive care unit, scored lower for quality of life in all domains compared to the reference population. The domains showed lower results for the delirious patients compared to the non delirious patients. Conclusions. Mortality was higher in delirious patients. All patients showed lower values for the quality of life at three months. The delirious patients showed lower results than the non delirious patients. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses are the first caregivers to observe patients. The fluctuating delirious process is often not noticed. Long term effects are not visible to the interdisciplinary team in the hospital. This paper would like to raise the awareness of professionals for long term outcomes for patients having experienced delirium in the intensive care unit.",0
583,"Introduction Delirium occurs in most ventilated patients and is independently associated with more deaths, longer stay, and higher cost. Guidelines recommend monitoring of delirium in all intensive care unit (ICU) patients, though few data exist in non-ventilated patients. The study objective was to determine the relationship between delirium and outcomes among non-ventilated ICU patients. Method A prospective cohort investigation of 261 consecutively admitted medical ICU patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation during hospitalization at a tertiary-care, university-based hospital between February 2002 and January 2003. ICU nursing staff assessed delirium and level of consciousness at least twice per day using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS). Cox regression with time-varying covariates was used to determine the independent relationship between delirium and clinical outcomes. Results Of 261 patients, 125 (48%) experienced at least one episode of delirium. Patients who experienced delirium were older ( mean +/- SD: 56 +/- 18 versus 49 +/- 17 years; p = 0.002) and more severely ill as measured by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores ( median 15, interquartile range (IQR) 10 - 21 versus 11, IQR 6 - 16; p < 0.001) compared to their non-delirious counterparts. Patients who experienced delirium had a 29% greater risk of remaining in the ICU on any given day ( compared to patients who never developed delirium) even after adjusting for age, gender, race, Charlson co-morbidity score, APACHE II score, and coma ( hazard ratio (HR) 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 - 1.69, p = 0.07). Similarly, patients who experienced delirium had a 41% greater risk of remaining in the hospital after adjusting for the same covariates ( HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.05 - 1.89, p = 0.023). Hospital mortality was higher among patients who developed delirium (24/125, 19%) versus patients who never developed delirium (8/135, 6%), p = 0.002; however, time to in-hospital death was not significant the adjusted ( HR 1.27; 95% CI 0.55 - 2.98, p = 0.58). Conclusion Delirium occurred in nearly half of the non-ventilated ICU patients in this cohort. Even after adjustment for relevant covariates, delirium was found to be an independent predictor of longer hospital stay.",0
584,"Background: Despite the fact that almost all critically ill children experience some degree of pain or anxiety, there is a lack of high-quality evidence to inform preferred approaches to sedation, analgesia, and comfort measures in this environment. We conducted this survey to better understand current comfort and sedation practices among Canadian pediatric intensivists. Methods: The survey was conducted after a literature review and initial focus groups. The survey was then pretested and validated. The final survey was distributed by email to 134 intensivists from 17 PICUs across Canada using the Research Electronic Data Capture system. Results: The response rate was 73% (98/134). The most commonly used sedation scores are Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (42%) and COMFORT (41%). Withdrawal scores are commonly used (65%). In contrast, delirium scores are used by only 16% of the respondents. Only 36% of respondents have routinely used sedation protocols. The majority (66%) do not use noise reduction methods, whereas only 23% of respondents have a protocol to promote day/night cycles. Comfort measures including music, swaddling, soother, television, and sucrose solutions are frequently used. The drugs most commonly used to provide analgesia are morphine and acetaminophen. Midazolam and chloral hydrate were the most frequent sedatives. Conclusion: Our survey demonstrates great variation in practice in the management of pain and anxiety in Canadian PICUs. Standardized strategies for sedation, delirium and withdrawal, and sleep promotion are lacking. There is a need for research in this field and the development of evidence-based, pediatric sedation and analgesia guidelines.",0
585,"Objectives: As critical care advances and intensive care unit mortality declines, the number of survivors of critical illness is increasing. These survivors frequently experience long-lasting complications of critical care. As a result, it is important to understand these complications and implement evidence-based practices to minimize them. Data Sources: Database searches and review of relevant medical literature. Data Synthesis: Critical illness and intensive care unit care influence a wide range of long-term patient outcomes, with some impairments persisting for 5-15 yrs. Impaired pulmonary function, greater healthcare utilization, and increased mortality are observed in intensive care survivors. Neuromuscular weakness and impairments in both physical function and related aspects of quality of life are common and may be long-lasting. These complications may be reduced by multidisciplinary physical rehabilitation initiated early and continued throughout the intensive care unit care stay and by providing patient education for self-rehabilitation after hospital discharge. Common neuropsychiatric complications, including cognitive impairment and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder, are frequently associated with intensive care unit sedation, delirium or delusional memories, and long-term impairments in quality of life. Conclusions: Survivors of critical illness are frequently left with a legacy of long-term physical, neuropsychiatric, and quality of life impairments. Understanding patient and intensive care risk factors can help identify patients who are most at risk of these complications. Furthermore, modifiable risk factors and beneficial interventions are increasingly being identified to help inform practical management recommendations to reduce the prevalence and impact of these long-term complications.

586,"Aims and objectivesTo describe the perspectives of healthcare professionals caring for intubated patients on implementing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) in critical care settings. BackgroundPatients in critical care settings subjected to endotracheal intubation suffer from a temporary functional speech disorder and can also experience anxiety, stress and delirium, leading to longer and more complicated hospitalisation and rehabilitation. Little is known about the use of AAC in critical care settings. MethodThe design was informed by interpretive descriptive methodology along with the theoretical framework symbolic interactionism, which guided the study of healthcare professionals (n=48) in five different intensive care units. Data were generated through participant observations and 10 focus group interviews. ResultsThe findings represent an understanding of the healthcare professionals' perspectives on implementing AAC in critical care settings and revealed three themes. Caring Ontology was the foundation of the healthcare professionals' profession. Cultural Belief represented the actual premise in the interactions during the healthcare professionals' work, saving lives in a biomedical setting whilst appearing competent and efficient, leading to Triggered Conduct and giving low priority to psychosocial issues like communication. ConclusionLack of the ability to communicate puts patients at greater risk of receiving poorer treatment, which supports the pressuring need to implement and use AAC in critical care. It is documented that culture in biomedical paradigms can have consequences that are the opposite of the staffs' ideals. The findings may guide staff in implementing AAC strategies in their communication with patients and at the same time preserve their caring ontology and professional pride. Relevance to clinical practiceImproving communication strategies may improve patient safety and make a difference in patient outcomes. Increased knowledge of and familiarity with AAC strategies may provide healthcare professionals with an enhanced feeling of competence.",0
587,"Objectives: This review identifies the most significant factors, which impact upon the user experience of progress and recovery from critical illness during the first month after discharge from critical care, and discusses these in relation to the development of effective critical care discharge support strategies. Design: Meta-synthesis of qualitative primary research. Data sources: Qualitative research published in English between 1990 and 2009 was identified using online databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, British Nursing Index, CDSR, ACP Journal Club, Cochrane library, Social Policy and Practice and PsycInfo. Studies of adult patients, relatives/carers/significant others, which focused on experiences after discharge from an intensive care or high dependency unit to a general ward were retrieved. Review methods: Following screening against inclusion/exclusion criteria, methodological appraisal of studies was conducted using a published framework. Ten studies met the criteria for inclusion. Results: Five key themes emerged from the meta-synthesis: physical and psychological symptoms; making progress; the need to know; and safety and security. Conclusions: Findings from this meta-synthesis and other related literature supports the existence of physical and psychological problems in the immediate period following discharge from critical care to the ward, and suggests that patients and their families have a desire for more control over their recovery. However, this desire is countered by a need to feel safe and protected, culminating in an expression of dependence on healthcare staff. Any effective support strategy needs to take account of these findings. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
588,"Delirium is a common event in the hospitalized surgical patiens. The pathophysiology of delirium is incompletely understood yet, but numerous risk factors for the development of delirium have been already identified. A literature review was performed using the National Library of Medicine PubMed database and Web of Science, including all resources within the period 1991-2011, additional references were found through bibliography reviews of relevant articles. The key word ""delirium"" with the following terms:""intensive care unit"",""antipsychotics"", ""benzodiazepine"", ""opioids"", ""elderly"", ""management"". Constraints limiting time period of publications or their language were not applied. Reference lists of publications identified by these procedures were hand-searched for additional relevant references. Delirium in the ICU (intensive care unit) is not only a frightening experience for the patient and his or her family; it is also a challenge for the nurses and physicians taking care of the patient. Furthermore, it is also associated with worse outcome, prolonged hospitalisation, increased costs, long-term cognitive impairment and higher mortality rates. Predisposing factors, such as age, impairment, and nature and severity of comorbidity, increase the risk of experiencing delirium during hospitalization. The management of delirium involves the concurrent search for and treatment of the underlying aetiology while actively controlling the symptoms of delirium. Antipsychotics are demonstrating efficacy in controlling the symptoms of delirium with less extrapyramidal side effects. Proper diagnosis and treatment is important in the medical setting and significantly decreases the burden on the patient, caregivers, and medical system.",0
589,"Aims and objectivesThe aim of this article is to review and synthesise the empirical literature on patient recall of delirium episodes and to provide a direction for future research. BackgroundDelirium is a common and costly condition seen in hospitalised and institutionalised patients. Much of the existing literature focuses on delirium detection, risk factors, aetiologies and treatment. Few studies describe the patient experience of delirium recall. DesignA literature search was conducted using the databases of the National Library of Medicine (PubMed/MEDLINE/OVID), the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature and the American Psychological Association (PsycINFO). Articles were restricted to the English language and from the years 1980-2014. MethodsAn integrative review of 12 selected studies on delirium recall was performed. ResultsThe majority of participants recalled their delirious episodes and during these episodes experienced both perceptual disturbances and psychological distress. Common themes from the qualitative data included incomprehensible experiences, strong emotional feelings and fear. ConclusionDelirium recall is common, is distressing and warrants further investigation. Future studies should employ standardised delirium detection tools and a systematic examination of factors that may predict delirium recall. Relevance to clinical practiceUnderstanding delirium recall may help nurses mitigate the psychological morbidity and distress associated with the phenomenon and generate new theories to improve care.",0
591,"Aims and objectives: This paper uses the findings of two studies to explore the nature Of nurses' practice when working with vulnerable and marginalised populations, particularly with regard to the attributes of holism and individualised care. A secondary analysis of the findings of two separate studies was undertaken, one on the elderly with delirium and the other with indigenous Maori women. Background: Often considered vulnerable and marginalised, elderly and indigenous experiences of health services are often fraught with their health needs not always identified or addressed., Nursing claims that holism and individualised care are pivotal attributes underpinning nursing practice. However, the secondary analysis of two research studies highlight how vulnerable and marginalised populations accessing health and nursing services experience needs that are neither acknowledged nor integrated into intervention and treatment plans. Design: A secondary analysis of one study with the elderly with delirium used a critical gerontological methodology informed by postmodernism and Foucault's understanding of discourse. The other study with indigenous Maori women utilised Glaserian grounded theory informed by a Maori-centred methodology. Methods: The research on the elderly with delirium analysed 20 data sources, including interviews with older persons who had experienced delirium, members Of their families and health professionals. The research with 38 indigenous Maori women aged between 24 and 65 years, inductively analysed interview data using constant comparative analysis, theoretical sampling and saturation of the core categories to generate a substantive grounded theory. Results: The findings of each study showed that a problem focussed approach to health care is offered to patients that does not incorporate individual health experiences. In addition, the social context integral to people's lives outside of the health care environment is ignored and as such the very foundations of nursing practice, that of holism, is merely a rhetorical construct. Conclusions: Vulnerable and marginalised patients experience care that neglects their perceived health needs and the realities of their life circumstances. Relevance to clinical practice: Individualised care that extends beyond the presenting issue is vital, but raises challenges when working with those population groups considered vulnerable and marginalised to improve outcomes of their health experience.",0
592,"Background: Life-threatening illness can be devastating for patients as they experience shifting levels of consciousness, recurrent delirium, and repeated setbacks. Narrative Medicine and its sub-discipline Narrative Critical Care increase healthcare professionals' understanding of the patient perspective, and interpretation of their stories is a means to improving practice. Purpose: We aimed to investigate book length first-person accounts of critical illness to gain a deeper understanding of universal and individual patient responses and to provide an example of Narrative Critical Care. Method: We performed a comparative literary analysis of five books supported by the Biographical Narrative Interpretive Method (BNIM) that moves through stages of structural analysis, thematic analysis, and cross-case theoretisation. Findings: Universal patient responses evolved through five existential dichotomies of life/death, sanity/madness, before/after, gain/loss and inner strength/external support. Individual patient responses were expressed as turning points along the illness trajectory, and biographical continuity was restored by integration of new self and old self. Conclusion: We uncovered commonalities and differences in storied accounts of critical illness and survival. New insights might enable healthcare professionals to personalize patient care. More consistency is needed during transitions and rehabilitation of intensive care survivors. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
593,"Natural disasters impact people of every age in the communities where they occur, with older adults being a vulnerable subset of the population. Most disaster shelter volunteer nurses are experienced in addressing common health needs of older adult clients such as diabetes, hypertension, and pulmonary disease. These nurses also have the requisite training to respond to more acute medical events, including the symptoms of a heart attack or stroke. They provide care and comfort to those suffering from the distress, anxiety, and fear caused by disasters. However, they may be less adept at triaging and caring for older adults with mental health conditions such as delirium, depression, or dementia. The trauma associated with a disaster and relocation will challenge cognitive abilities in those with dementia, may exacerbate existing depression, or lead to the onset of delirium, which is a medical emergency. Older adults experiencing these conditions are at risk for harm and deterioration with serious short and long-term consequences. Since disaster shelter volunteer health care staff may not be well-versed in distinguishing between dementia, depression, or delirium, behavior observation, and safety considerations are critical determinants of whether it is possible to support the older adult in the shelter environment or it is necessary to transition to a higher level of care.",0
594,"Background Delirium is defined as a disturbance in attention, awareness and cognition with reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain and shift attention, and reduced orientation to the environment. Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently develop ICU delirium. It can profoundly affect both them and their families because it is associated with increased mortality, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer hospital and ICU stay and long-term cognitive impairment. It also results in increased costs for society. Objectives To assess existing evidence for the effect of preventive interventions on ICU delirium, in-hospital mortality, the number of delirium and coma-free days, ventilator-free days, length of stay in the ICU and cognitive impairment. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, CINAHL from 1980 to 11 April 2018 without any language limits. We adapted the MEDLINE search for searching the other databases. Furthermore, we checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We also checked the following trial registries: Current Controlled Trials; ClinicalTrials.gov; and CenterWatch.com (all on 24 April 2018). Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult medical or surgical ICU patients receiving any intervention for preventing ICU delirium. The control could be standard ICU care, placebo or both. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE. Data collection and analysis We checked titles and abstracts to exclude obviously irrelevant studies and obtained full reports on potentially relevant ones. Two review authors independently extracted data. If possible we conducted meta-analyses, otherwise we synthesized data narratively. Main results The electronic search yielded 8746 records. We included 12 RCTs (3885 participants) comparing usual care with the following interventions: commonly used drugs (four studies); sedation regimens (four studies); physical therapy or cognitive therapy, or both (one study); environmental interventions (two studies); and preventive nursing care (one study). We found 15 ongoing studies and five studies awaiting classification. The participants were 48 to 70 years old; 48% to 74% were male; the mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score was 14 to 28 (range 0 to 71; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death). With the exception of one study, all participants were mechanically ventilated in medical or surgical ICUs or mixed. The studies were overall at low risk of bias. Six studies were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors. We report results for the two most commonly explored approaches to delirium prevention: pharmacologic and a non-pharmacologic intervention. Haloperidol versus placebo (two RCTs, 1580 participants) The event rate of ICU delirium was measured in one study including 1439 participants. No difference was identified between groups, (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.17) (moderate-quality evidence). Haloperidol versus placebo neither reduced or increased in-hospital mortality, (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22; 2 studies; 1580 participants (moderate-quality evidence)); the number of delirium-and coma-free days, (mean difference (MD)-0.60, 95% CI-1.37 to 0.17; 2 studies, 1580 participants (moderate quality of evidence)); number of ventilator-free days (mean 23.8 (MD-0.30, 95% CI-0.93 to 0.33) 1 study; 1439 participants, (high quality evidence)); length of ICU stay, (MD 0.18, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97); 2 studies, 1580 participants; high-quality evidence). None of the studies measured cognitive impairment. In one study there were three serious adverse events in the intervention group and five in the placebo group; in the other there were five serious adverse events and three patients died, one in each group. None of the serious adverse events were judged to be related to interventions received (moderate-quality evidence). Physical and cognitive therapy interventions (one study, 65 participants) The study did not measure the event rate of ICU delirium. A physical and cognitive therapy intervention versus standard care neither reduced nor increased in-hospital mortality, (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.20, I-2 = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence); the number of delirium-and coma-free days, (MD-2.8, 95% CI-10.1 to 4.6, I-2 = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence); the number of ventilator-free days (within the first 28/30 days) was median 27.4 (IQR 0 to 29.2) and 25 (IQR 0 to 28.9); 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence, length of ICU stay, (MD 1.23, 95% CI-0.68 to 3.14, I-2 = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence); cognitive impairment measured by the MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination with higher scores indicating better function, (MD 0.97, 95% CI-0.19 to 2.13, I-2 = 0; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-quality evidence); or measured by the Dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX) with lower scores indicating better function (MD-8.76, 95% CI-19.06 to 1.54, I-2 = 0; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-quality evidence). One patient experienced acute back pain accompanied by hypotensive urgency during physical therapy. Authors' conclusions There is probably little or no difference between haloperidol and placebo for preventing ICU delirium but further studies are needed to increase our confidence in the findings. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of physical and cognitive intervention on delirium. The effects of other pharmacological interventions, sedation, environmental, and preventive nursing interventions are unclear and warrant further investigation in large multicentre studies. Five studies are awaiting classification and we identified 15 ongoing studies, evaluating pharmacological interventions, sedation regimens, physical and occupational therapy combined or separately, and environmental interventions, that may alter the conclusions of the review in future.",0
595,"BackgroundInappropriate sedation assessment can jeopardize patient comfort and safety. Therefore, nurses' abilities in assessing and managing sedation are vital for effective care of mechanically ventilated patients. Aims and objectivesThis study assessed nurses' sedation scoring and management abilities as primary outcomes following educational interventions. Nurses' perceived self-confidence and barriers to effective sedation management were assessed as secondary outcomes. DesignA post-test-only quasi-experimental design was used. Data were collected at 3 and 9 months post-intervention. MethodsA total of 66 nurses from a 14-bed intensive care unit of a Malaysian teaching hospital participated. The educational interventions included theoretical sessions, hands-on sedation assessment practice using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, and a brief sedation assessment tool. Nurses' sedation scoring and management abilities and perceived self-confidence level were assessed at both time points using self-administered questionnaires with case scenarios. Sedation assessment and management barriers were assessed once at 9months post-intervention. ResultsMedian scores for overall accurate sedation scoring (9months: 400; 3months: 200, p=00001) and overall sedation management (9months: 140; 3months: 70, p=00001) were significantly higher at 9months compared to 3months post-intervention. There were no significant differences in the perceived self-confidence level for rating sedation level. Overall perceived barrier scores were low (M=2778, SD=626, possible range=110-550). Patient conditions (M=368, SD=113) and nurses' workload (M=354, SD=095) were the greatest barriers to effective sedation assessment and management. Demographic variables did not affect sedation scoring or management abilities. ConclusionsPositive changes in nurses' sedation assessment and management abilities were observed, indicating that adequate hands-on clinical practice following educational interventions can improve nurses' knowledge and skills. Relevance to clinical practiceEducational initiatives are necessary to improve ICU practice, particularly in ICUs with inexperienced nurses.",0
596,"BACKGROUND: In ICU, the stay is frequently a stressful experience. Caregivers may help to understand patients' perceptions; however, their reliability is uncertain. Despite the recent recommendations of lighter sedation targets, little is known about the impact of ""conscious sedation"" on ICU patients memories. Purpose of this prospective, observational study is to analyze the stress perception in consciously-sedated ICU-patients, comparing it to caregivers and staff members. METHODS: Twenty-nine high-risk ICU-patients treated with awake/cooperative sedation were enrolled. Before discharge, patients received a validated questionnaire for ICU stressors evaluation, also administered to their main caregiver (N.=29), to caregivers of other ICU patients not enrolled in the study (N.=33) and to staff members (ICU nurses, attending physicians, residents, medical students, N.=56). RESULTS: Total stress score was: patients 141 +/- 41, patient relatives 210 +/- 63, other relatives: 202 +/- 73, ICU staff: 231+44, P<0.001. Among patients, older age (P=0.031), longer ICU-stay (P=0.018) and awake-sedation (P=0.022) were associated with lower stress; sex and illness severity had no effect; mechanical ventilation length (P=0.021) and agitation (P=0.029) were associated with higher stress. Nurses tended to overestimate stressors more than attending physicians and trainees. Within staff members, age (P=0.021) and years of experience (P=0.069) were positively associated with overestimation. CONCLUSIONS: Conscious sedation is associated with stress perception lower than stress assessed by caregivers: relatives and staff members tend to overestimate ICU patient stress, more so with increasing age or expertise. A number of stressors underestimated by staff and families could be target of specific interventions to ameliorate quality of life during ICU stay.",0
597,"This study aimed to determine patient and therapeutic characteristics of patients in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) that contribute to inconsistent results of delirium assessments performed during routine clinical practice. Therefore, electronic health records were reviewed and compared with secondary data collected from the same medical ICU patients who were assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method in the ICU (CAM-ICU). Of 5,241 cases involving 762 patients, 827 (15.78%) cases showed disagreement between assessments. Continuous renal replacement therapy, physical restraint use, and altered mental status were factors that increased the likelihood of inconsistencies between assessments. A significant positive correlation was found between the CAM-ICU disagreement rate and the total number of assessments per month. To maximize the reliability of delirium assessments, individual-targeted approaches considering the patient's level of consciousness and type of treatment implemented are required, along with ensuring a stable, and regulated working environment and customized educational programs.",0
598,"Purpose: To identify the barriers and enablers that influence clinicians' implementation of early rehabilitation in critical care. Materials and methods: Qualitative study involving 26 multidisciplinary participants who were recruited using purposive sampling. Four focus groups were conducted using semistructured questions to explore attitudes, beliefs, and experiences. Data were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was performed. Results: Six themes emerged, as follows: (1) the clinicians' expectations and knowledge (including rationale for rehabilitation, perceived benefits, and experience), (2) the evidence for and application of rehabilitation (including beliefs regarding when to intervene), (3) patient factors (including prognosis, sedation, delirium, cooperation, motivation, goals, and family), (4) safety considerations (including physiological stability and presence of devices or lines), (5) environmental influences (staffing, resources, equipment, time, and competing priorities), and (6) culture and teamwork. Key strategies identified to facilitate rehabilitation included addressing educational needs for all multidisciplinary team members, supporting junior nursing staff, and potential expansion of physiotherapy staffing hours to closer align with the 24-hour patient care model. Conclusions: Key barriers to implementation of early rehabilitation in critical care are diverse and include both clinician-and health care system-related factors. Research targeted at bridging this evidence-practice gap is required to improve provision of rehabilitation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
599,"Background Cardiac surgery (CS) patients spend a significant amount of time in the intensive care unit (ICU). This event can be very overwhelming, with an intense emotional impact, causing vulnerability and a sense of helplessness in patients. Currently, the in-depth description of the ICU stay experience from a patient's own perspective is little studied, especially in the CS setting and using a qualitative approach in Italy. Aims This study aimed to describe CS patients' lived experiences. Methods A qualitative phenomenological study was conducted between October 2018 and December 2019 using the interpretative phenomenological analysis approach. Results Eleven patients were interviewed during the months after discharge from the ICU. Four main themes emerged from the analysis of the interviews: (a) will not wake up anymore; (b) endless time in ICU; (c) something keeps me from breathing; and (d) ""anchor in the storm."" Results confirm the negative experience of patients in the ICU, mainly because of the extubating procedure. Nurses were found to play a key role in decisions, supporting and protecting patients from the psychological stress related to the ICU stay. Conclusion This is the first study capturing ICU patients' lived experiences after a CS intervention with the use of interpretative phenomenology in Italy. Further investigations are warranted to systematically identify which approaches or strategies are essential to support these patients in the Italian context. Relevance to clinical practice Our study's results could be useful for tailored care delivery to meet the real needs of Italian patients in the ICU after CS and, consequently, improve the quality of nursing care and patients' outcomes.",0
600,"Background: Communication and information in order to reduce anxiety in the intensive care unit (ICU) has been described as area needing improvement. Therefore, the aim of this trial was to evaluate whether a structured information program that intensifies information given in standard care process reduces anxiety in ICU patients. Methods: Multicenter, two-armed, non-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial in hospitals in the cities of Marburg, Halle, and Stuttgart (Germany). The trial was performed in cardiac surgery, general surgery, and internal medicine ICUs. Two-hundred and eleven elective and non-elective ICU patients were enrolled in the study (intervention group, n = 104; control group, n = 107). The experimental intervention comprised a single episode of structured oral information that was given in addition to standard care and covered two main parts: (1) A more standardized part about predefined ICU specific aspects - mainly procedural, sensory and coping information, and (2) an individualized part about fears and questions of the patient. The control group received a non-specific episodic conversation of similar length additional to standard care. Both conversations took place at the beginning of the ICU stay and lasted 10-15 minutes. Study nurses administered both interventions. The primary outcome ICU-related anxiety (CINT-Score, 0-100 pts., higher scores indicate higher anxiety) was assessed after admission to a regular ward. Results: The primary outcome could be measured in 82 intervention group participants and 90 control group participants resulting in mean values of 20.4 (SD 14.4) compared to 20.8 (SD 14.7) and a mean difference of -0.2 (CI 95% -4.5 to 4.1). Conclusions: A structured information intervention additional to standard care during ICU stay had no demonstrated additional benefit compared to an unspecific communication of similar duration. Reduction of anxiety in ICU patients will probably require more continuous approaches to information giving and communication.",0
601,"Study Objective Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium is an acute brain dysfunction that has been associated with increased mortality, prolonged ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and development of post-ICU cognitive impairment. Melatonin may help to restore sleep and reduce the occurrence of ICU delirium. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin for the prevention of ICU delirium in critically ill adults. Design Retrospective, observational cohort study. Setting Large academic medical center. Patients A total of 232 adults were included who were admitted to the medical-surgical or cardiac ICUs between 2013 and 2017 who had a negative Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Of those, patients who received melatonin for at least 48 hours were included in the melatonin group (n=117). Patients were included in the control group if they were admitted to the ICU for at least 4 days (average time of melatonin initiation) and did not receive melatonin or antipsychotics within the first 4 days of their ICU stay (n=115). Measurements and Main Results The primary outcome was development of delirium, which was assessed by using the CAM-ICU twice daily by nursing staff. The development of delirium was significantly lower in the melatonin group: 9 (7.7%) versus 28 (24.3%) patients (p = 0.001). This finding remained significant in multivariate logistic models controlling for age, sex, history of hypertension, need for emergent surgery, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, dexmedetomidine use, and benzodiazepine use. For those patients who developed delirium, patients in the control group had, on average, 20.9 delirium-free days without coma in 28 days compared with 19.9 days in the melatonin group (p = 0.72). In the melatonin group, melatonin was used for a mean +/- SD of 6.3 +/- 7.9 days, with a median dose of 3.5 mg/night (range: 1-10 mg). Conclusion The development of ICU delirium was significantly lower in the melatonin group compared with that in the control group. To our knowledge, this is one of the only studies that has examined the use of melatonin for the prevention of ICU delirium. Melatonin may be a promising agent for the prevention of ICU delirium; however, a randomized study is needed to further validate its efficacy.",0
602,"Aims and objectives To identify how civilian nurses are caring for military veterans following mandatory continuing education on veterans' mental health needs and to describe challenges nurses are facing in provision of that care. Background Veterans and military personnel experience mental health conditions at a high rate and are increasingly receiving care in civilian healthcare facilities. Nonmilitary providers may not be prepared to address this population's challenging needs. Military culture may influence the presentation of mental health conditions; thus, critical assessment points by nonmilitary medical personnel may be missed. Education is touted internationally as a means to address deficits, but research is lacking to support that statement. Methods Adhering to research reporting guidelines, 115 of a proposed 322 civilian nurses in a tertiary hospital volunteered to complete a one-time online survey that contained quantitative and demographic questions. Forty of 115 nurses went on to complete the qualitative query. Descriptive statistics summarised quantitative results, and constant comparative analysis was applied to qualitative responses for theme identification. Results The study was stopped early due to reports of violence from veterans upon nurses. Results showed continuing education did not change documentation of military status. Following mandatory continuing education, civilian nurses continued to describe uncertainty in how to adapt care, on how to interact with veterans and in how to deal with violence. Conclusion The status of care to veterans remains insufficient, but nurses are asking critical questions on how to update practice. Additional support and research in the clinical setting is needed to promote a safe caring environment. Relevance to clinical practice Continuing education alone may not advance care of the veteran. A multipronged approach to include mandatory documentation of military status and coaching of providers by those experienced with the military way of life may be used to augment staff preparedness.",0
603,"Background:The awakening and breathing coordination of daily sedation and ventilator removal trials, delirium monitoring and management, and early mobility and exercise (ABCDE) and assessment, prevent and manage pain, both spontaneous awakening and spontaneous breathing trials, choice of analgesia and sedation, assess, prevent and manage delirium, early mobility and exercise, family engagement (ABCDEF) bundles are part of the science of the liberation of the intensive care unit (ICU). There are not enough studies that have evaluated the effectiveness and safety of the implementation of these bundles. This study will analyze the implementation process, estimate their effectiveness and safety, and identify barriers, facilitators and attitudes that have influenced the implementation process.Methods:Qualitative and quantitative studies will be eligible for our systematic review with adult patients who have been exposed to the implementation of the ABCDE or ABCDEF bundles compared to the usual care in the ICU. In order to search the implementation interventions of the bundles, we will search electronically: MEDLINE (PubMed); Excerpta Medica Database (Ovid); Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (EBSCO); The Cochrane Library (Wiley); Web of Science; Virtual Health Library; and OpenGrey. We will not impose any language restrictions or publication status. Outcomes of interest include ICU and hospital length of stay; mechanical ventilation time; incidence and prevalence of delirium or coma; level of agitation and sedation; early mobilization; mortality in ICU and hospital; change in perception, attitude or behavior of the stakeholders; and change in knowledge of health professionals. The team of reviewers will independently screen search results, extract data from eligible studies, and assess risk of bias. Disagreements between the reviewers will be solved through consensus or arbitration by a third-party investigator. To assess the quality and risk of bias in randomized and quasi-randomized trials we will use the domain-based evaluation recommended by The Cochrane Handbook. Studies with other methodological designs will be evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Tools developed by The Joanna Briggs Institute. Other instruments may be used, if necessary.Results:The evidence derived from this study will increase the knowledge of effectiveness and safety of the implementation process of ABCDE and ABCDEF bundles.Conclusion:The results could guide patients and healthcare practitioners by helping to facilitate evidence-based shared care decision making.Protocol registration:PROSPERO CRD42019121307.",0
604,"Objectives: Spontaneous awakening trials (SATs) improve outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients, but implementation remains erratic. We examined variation in reported practice, prevalence of attitudes and fears regarding spontaneous awakening trials, and organizational practices associated with routine implementation of spontaneous awakening trials in an ICU quality improvement collaborative. Design: Written survey. Setting: Michigan Health and Hospital Association's Keystone ICU, a quality improvement collaborative of 73 hospitals. Subjects: Attendees of the yearly Keystone ICU meeting, January 2011, including nurses, physicians, hospital administrators, and other healthcare professionals. Intervention: Respondents were asked about institutional characteristics, spontaneous awakening trial practice, attitudes and barriers regarding spontaneous awakening trials, and organizational cultural characteristics that might influence SAT practice. The association of organizational cultural characteristics and attitudes with reported spontaneous awakening trial use was evaluated using logistic regression. Measurements and Main Results: Three hundred nineteen participants attended the meeting. The survey response rate was 83.4%. Respondents reported wide variation in approach to spontaneous awakening trial performance and patient selection. 48.6% of respondents reported regular spontaneous awakening trial use, defined as greater than 75% of mechanically ventilated patients undergoing spontaneous awakening trials each day. In bivariable analysis, addressing sedation goals routinely in rounds and having spontaneous awakening trials as part of unit culture were positively associated with regular spontaneous awakening trial use, whereas the perception that spontaneous awakening trials increased short-term adverse effects, staff fears of spontaneous awakening trials, and the perception that spontaneous awakening trials are hard work were negatively associated with regular spontaneous awakening trial use. In multivariable analysis, only addressing sedation in rounds (odds ratio, 2.85 [95% CI, 1.55-5.23]), incorporation of spontaneous awakening trials into unit culture (odds ratio, 3.36 [95% CI, 1.75-6.43]), and the perception that spontaneous awakening trials are hard work (odds ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.30-0.96]) remained statistically significantly associated with regular spontaneous awakening trial use. Respondents in managerial positions were less likely to perceive spontaneous awakening trials as hard work (odds ratio, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.22-0.85]). Conclusions: Even in a motivated statewide quality improvement collaborative, spontaneous awakening trial practice varies widely and concerns persist regarding spontaneous awakening trials. Cultural practices may counteract the effect of concerns regarding spontaneous awakening trials and are associated with increased performance of this beneficial intervention. Patient selection should be a focus for continuing medical education. Differences in perception of work between management and staff may also be a focus for improved communication.",0
605,"The main aim of this study was to examine, from the consumer's perspective, the components of best nursing practice in the care of acutely ill hospitalized elderly people who coincidentally suffered from dementia. Due to the complexity of the problem under investigation a triangulated design was formulated. This design comprised survey methodology, audit and critical incident technique. Data derived from each of these approaches were analysed first in isolation and subsequently combined at a conceptual level, The sample comprised 213 people aged 65 years and older, who were consecutive admissions from two acute medical and two acute care of elderly people wards. Sixty-six per cent of these individuals were found to suffer from cognitive impairment, 40% experiencing severe problems. The documentary survey revealed that patients with normal or severely abnormal cognitive functioning were more likely to have this noted than those with mild-moderate levels of impairment. No evidence of formal assessment was located and only 15% of these patients had items included in their nursing care plans associated with their chronic confusion. A sub-sample of 41 chronically confused people and their main hospital visitor were invited to participate in critical incident interviews. These conversations led to the identification of four major themes which reflected the most valued aspects of the nursing care which had been received or observed. The relationship between documentary care scores and the proportion of positive descriptions of care within each of the four themes was explored. The findings indicate that acute nursing care is deemed only to be at its best when it is delivered in tandem with dementia care. Discrete areas for practice development are identified and standards to guide nursing care are proposed. In addition to the practice development issues raised by the work, the methodological lessons further advance the practice of multi-method research.",0
606,"Early physiotherapy (EP) programs on critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) have proven to be safe, feasible and effective. However, despite being considered by all the professionals involved as a fundamental aspect of integrated care, in most cases they are inadequately applied or not performed at all. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the knowledge, perceptions and activities related to EP among physician, nurses and physiotherapists who practice in ICUs of Rome. Obstacles to its application and possible strategies to overcome them are also examined. The study was conducted according to the CHERRIES recommendations. Two questionnaires with 29 questions were created on the Google Form platform and were sent by mail to all the ICUs of public hospitals or accredited private hospitals with the National Health Service in Rome. Thirty (60%) of the contacted ICUs responded. The physiotherapist is present in 76.7% of ICUs and carries out its activities mainly during daytime hours (60.9%), for less than 3 hours in 39.1% of cases and only after a request for specialist advice (65.2%). Only in 4.3% of cases the service is guaranteed even at weekends but only after a request. All 29 professionals interviewed consider both the presence of a physiotherapist within the interdisciplinary team of the ICU and the implementation of an EP program to be necessary, supporting the positive effects of this program. The most frequently obstacles to the implementation of an EP program are clinical instability (69%), low priority to EP practice (62.1%), cardiovascular instability (58.6%) and lack of experience (58.6%). The most frequently indicated strategies to overcome these obstacles are to organize interdisciplinary briefings (86.2%), to avoid excluding patients from treatment without specific motivation (75.9%), to invest in staff training (75.9%), to use protocols and guidelines (58.6%). EP is not currently exploited to its full potential due to lack of funds, culture, experience, training and a hospital organization that limits the provision of effective patient care and efficient service to the National Health Service.",0
607,"Background Multiple factors are believed to contribute to disruption of patients' sleep and negatively affect clinical outcomes in the intensive care unit. Achieving restorative sleep for critically ill patients remains a challenge. Objectives To explore the perceptions and beliefs of staff, patients, and surrogates regarding the environmental and nonenvironmental factors in the medical intensive care unit that affect patients' sleep. Methods This qualitative study included 24 medical intensive care unit staff (7 physicians, 5 respiratory therapists, 10 nurses, and 2 patient-care assistants), 8 patients, and 6 patient surrogates. Semistructured interviews were conducted, and qualitative analysis of content was used to code, categorize, and identify interview themes. Results Interview responses revealed 4 themes with related subthemes: (1) The overnight medical intensive care unit environment does affect sleep, (2) nonenvironmental factors such as difficult emotions and anxiety also affect sleep, (3) respondents' perceptions about sleep quality in the medical intensive care unit were highly variable, and (4) suggestions for sleep improvement included reassuring patients and care-clustering strategies. Conclusions Results of this study suggest that environment is not the only factor influencing patients' sleep. Decreases in environmental sources of disturbance are necessary but not sufficient for sleep improvement. Guideline-recommended clustered care is needed to provide adequate sleep opportunity, but patients' emotions and anxiety also must be addressed.",0
608,"Background: Despite improvements in survival after critical illness and intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, some recovering patients still face ongoing challenges. There are few investigations exploring the incidence, risk factors, and trajectory for cognitive impairment (CI) in former ICU patients in Australia. Objectives: To test the feasibility of a study protocol designed to ascertain the incidence and impact of CI during recovery from a critical illness. Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods longitudinal single-centre pilot study. Participants were adult patients mechanically ventilated for >= 48 h. Cognitive function was assessed during hospitalisation and at 1 week, 2 months, and 6 months after hospital discharge, using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment instrument. Factors potentially affecting cognitive function were also collected, including demographic and clinical variables and fatigue, frailty, and muscle strength. Semistructured interviews were conducted to further explore participants' experiences during recovery. Results: We screened 2068 patients (10% met the inclusion criteria). Participants (n = 20) were mostly male with a mean age 61.9 years and a median of 4 days of mechanical ventilation. Data collection was complete for 14 and 11 participants at 2 months and 6 months, respectively. Pre-illness patients were not cognitively impaired; one patient had delirium in ICU. The proportion of patients with CI ranged from 80% (17/18) while in hospital to 35% (5/14) at 6 months. Participants were challenged by fatigue and sleep disruption during recovery but were not particularly concerned about CI. Conclusions: Recruitment in ICU was challenging as few patients received prolonged mechanical ventilation. The protocol was feasible, but some attrition was noted. A significant proportion of patients had mild CI, largely confined to recall, and language cognitive domains; quantitative findings were supported by interview findings. Further investigations are required to ascertain the most appropriate inclusion criteria to enable identification of those at highest risk of CI.

609,"Background Neurosurgical intensive care unit patients are at high risk for delirium. A risk prediction model could help the staff screen for patients at high risk for delirium. On the basis of this risk, preventive measures could be taken to reduce the undesired effects of delirium. Objectives To establish a delirium prediction model for neurosurgical intensive care unit patients and to verify the sensitivity and specificity of this model. Design A prospective, observational, single-centre study. Methods Data were collected from a total of 310 patients admitted to the neurosurgery intensive care unit between January 2017 and February 2018. A risk factor prediction model was then created using multivariate logistic regression. Further data were collected from another 60 patients between March 2018 and June 2018 to validate the model. Results The model consisted of six predictors, namely, cognitive dysfunction on admission, fever, hypoalbuminaemia, abnormal liver function, sedative use four or more times, and physical restraint. The area under the curve of the model was 0.80, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.68 and 0.83, respectively. Conclusions This study established a delirium prediction model for neurosurgical intensive care unit patients, which we believe would help focused prevention of delirium in intensive care unit patients.",0
610,"The administration of sedatives and analgesics on the intensive care unit (ICU) is routine daily practice. The correct discrimination between delirium, pain and anxiety or confusion is essential for the strategy and selection of medication. The correct pain therapy and sedation are essential for patient quality of life on the ICU and for the prognosis. The aim of this article is to present state of the art recommendations on the classification of pain and pain therapy on the ICU. An online search was carried out in PubMed for publications on the topics of ""pain"" and ""ICU"". Critical care patients are frequently subjected to many procedures and situations which can cause pain. The perception of pain is, among other things, influenced by the degree of orientation, anxiety and the degree of sedation. The administration of analgesics and non-pharmacological approaches are effective in reducing the stress perceived by patients. The main aim is improvement in the awareness of nursing and medical personnel for pain inducers and pain perception in ICU patients. The classification of pain must be made objectively. Therapeutic targets must be defined and in addition to the correct selection of pain medication, non-pharmacological approaches must also be consistently implemented.",0
611,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which data entry forms, guidelines, and other materials used for documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) attend to 6 key end-of-life care (EOLC) domains: 1) patient and family-centered decision making, 2) communication, 3) continuity of care, 4) emotional and practical support, 5) symptom management and comfort care, and 6) spiritual support. A second purpose was to determine how these materials might be modified to include more EOLC content and used to trigger clinical behaviors that might improve the quality of EOLC. Participants: Fifteen adult ICUs-8 medical, 2 surgical, and 4 mixed ICUs from the United States, and 1 mixed ICU in Canada, all affiliated with the Critical Care End-of-Life Peer Workgroup Methods: Physician-nurse teams in each ICU received detailed checklists to facilitate and standardize collection of requested documentation materials. Content analysis was performed on the collected documents, aimed at characterizing the types of materials in use and the extent to which EOLC content was incorporated. Measurements and Main Results: The domain of symptom management and comfort care was integrated most consistently on forms and other materials across the 15 ICUs, particularly pain assessment and management. The 5 other EOLC domains of patient and family centered decision-making, communication, emotional and practical support, continuity of care, and spiritual support were not well-represented on documentation. None of the 15 ICUs supplied a comprehensive EOLC policy or EOLC critical pathway that outlined an overall, interdisciplinary, sequenced approach for the care of dying patients and their families. Nursing materials included more cues for attending to EOLC domains and were more consistently preprinted and computerized than materials used by physicians. Computerized forms concerning EOLC were uncommon. Across the 15 ICUs, there were opportunities to make EOLC-related materials more capable of triggering and documenting specific EOLC clinical behaviors. Conclusions: Inclusion of EOLC items on ICU formatted data entry forms and other materials capable of triggering and documenting clinician behaviors is limited, particularly for physicians. Standardized scales, protocols, and guidelines exist for many of the EOLC domains and should be evaluated for possible use in ICUs. Whether such materials can improve EOLC has yet to be determined.

613,"Objective: In this study, we characterised the use of physical restraints in three intensive care units (ICUs) in a general hospital in Nantong, China. Additionally, we explored risk factors potentially related to physical restraint use. Background: Despite their numerous harmful effects, physical restraints are frequently used in ICUs worldwide. Few studies have investigated the factors that contribute to physical restraint use in Chinese hospitals. Methods: We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional, observational study of 312 patients in three ICUs at a general hospital in China. The quantitative data were collected during a 5-month period using a physical restraint observation form and patient records. The data obtained were analysed using descriptive statistics. The independent risk factors for physical restraint use were assessed using a logistic regression model. Results: Of the 312 patients in the three ICUs, 191 (61.2%) were restrained, and physical restraints were used more than once for 46 (24.1%) patients during their ICU stay. The median length of physical restrain use was 20 shifts (interquartile range = 10-36 shifts). Physical restraints were applied in 6664 of 12374 (53.9%) nurse shifts. The most common time at which physical restraints were applied was the beginning of the evening shift. According to the forward stepwise logistic regression analysis, delirium (P < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (P < 0.001), and age (P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for physical restraint use. The use of analgesics (P = 0.001) exerted an independent protective effect against physical restraint use. Conclusions: The overall prevalence of physical restraint use in Chinese ICUs was higher than that reported in previous investigations. The patients' nursing notes lacked complete physical restraint records, reflecting a need for standard guidelines and policies for physical restraint use in hospital ICUs in China. In addition, in this study, we explored the risk factors related to physical restraint use and found that age, delirium, mechanical ventilation, and analgesic use are associated with physical restraint use.

614,"Aim To develop an implementation plan for delirium prevention. Background The use of non-pharmacological interventions to prevent hospital-acquired delirium is well established but their implementation has been notoriously difficult to achieve. Systematic analysis of context as part of implementation planning is critical. Methods Ethnographic study was conducted in a 24-bed general medical ward. Eleven patients and family members and 15 health service staff participated through observations, individual interviews and document review. Inductive analysis was used to generate themes that described enablers and barriers. Results Enablers included a ward culture that embraced safety and placing the person at the centre of care. Barriers were in tension with the enablers and included limited staff knowledge, specialist forms exclusive to the nursing discipline, inflexible ward routines and frequent disruptions. Conclusions In addition to standard implementation strategies such as individual education and leadership, implementing delirium prevention requires consideration of team practices, review of policy document design and identification of outcomes data than can support collaborative reflexive practice. Implications for Nursing Management The use of a theory-informed ethnographic approach exposed tensions that may be otherwise invisible. Understanding the tensions increases the likelihood of implementation success. Using a systematic assessment approach can create a comprehensive implementation plan.",0
615,"Aim: To establish incidence, phenotype, long-term functional outcome, and early EEG predictors of delirium after cardiac arrest. Methods: This is an ad hoc analysis of a prospective cohort study on outcome prediction of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Patients with recovery of consciousness, who survived until hospital discharge, were subdivided in groups with and without delirium based on psychiatric consultation. Delirium phenotype and medical treatment were retrieved from patient files. All other data were prospectively collected. We used univariate analyses of baseline and early EEG characteristics for identification of possible delirium predictors. Association of delirium with neurological recovery at six months was analyzed with multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: Of 233 patients, 141 survived until hospital discharge, of whom 47 (33%) were diagnosed with delirium. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between patients with and without delirium. All delirious patients were treated with relatively high dosages of psychopharmaceuticals, mostly haloperidol and benzodiazepine agonists. Prevalent characteristics were disturbed cognition, perception and psychomotor functioning (98%). Half of the patients had language disorders or shouting. Delirium was associated with longer ICU and hospital admission, and more frequent discharge to rehabilitation centre or nursing home. There was a trend towards poorer neurological recovery. EEG measurements within 12 h after cardiac arrest could predict delirium with 91% specificity and 40% sensitivity. Discussion: Delirium is common after cardiac arrest, and probably leads to longer hospitalization and poorer outcome. Optimal treatment is unclear. Early EEG holds potential to identify patients at risk.",0
616,Withdrawal assessment in critically ill children is complicated by the reliance on non-specific behaviours and compounded when the child's typical behaviours are unknown. The existing approach to withdrawal assessment assumes that nurses elicit the parents' view of the child's behaviours. Objective and research methodology: This qualitative study explored parents' perspectives of their child's withdrawal and preferences for involvement and participation in withdrawal assessment. Parents of eleven children were interviewed after their child had completed sedation weaning during recovery from critical illness. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Setting: A large children's hospital in the Northwest of England. Findings: Parents experienced varying degrees of partnership in the context of withdrawal assessment and identified information deficits which contributed to their distress of parenting a child with withdrawal syndrome. Most parents were eager to participate in withdrawal assessment and reported instances where their knowledge enabled a personalised interpretation of their child's behaviours. Reflecting on the reciprocal nature of the information deficits resulted in the development of a model for nurse-parent collaboration in withdrawal assessment. Conclusion: Facilitating nurse-parent collaboration in withdrawal assessment may have reciprocal benefits by moderating parental stress and aiding the assessment and management of withdrawal syndrome.

617,"Background Detecting delirium with standardized assessment tools such as the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) is important, but such detection is frequently hampered by poor documentation and inappropriate ""unable to assess"" responses (in noncomatose patients). Objective To identify patient, clinical, and workplace factors that may impede or facilitate appropriate delirium assessment through use of the CAM-ICU, specifically documentation and inappropriate ""unable to assess"" responses. Methods An electronic health record-based data set was used to quantify CAM-ICU documentation and inappropriate ""unable to assess"" responses during 24 months. Associated patient (eg, age), clinical (eg, diagnosis), and workplace (eg, geographic location within the ICU, shift) factors were evaluated with multivariable regression. Results Of 28 586 CAM-ICU documentation opportunities, 66% were documented; 16% of documentations in alert or lightly sedated patients had inappropriate ""unable to assess"" responses. Night shift was associated with lower CAM-ICU documentation rates (P= .001), whereas physical restraints and location on side B (rather than side A) of the ICU were associated with higher documentation rates (P < .05 for both). Age older than 80 years, non-White race, intubation, and physical restraints were associated with more inappropriate ""unable to assess"" responses (all P < .05), as was infusion of propofol, midazolam, dexmedetomidine, or fentanyl (all P< .05). Conclusion Data from electronic health records can identify patient, clinical, and workplace factors associated with CAM-ICU documentation and inappropriate ""unable to assess"" responses, which can help target quality improvement efforts related to delirium assessment.

618,"Background: Delirium is the most common complication as well as the most significant cause of various clinical outcomes in older adults who undergo hip fracture surgery. However, there is scarce consensus on this. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for delirium, its incidence and features, and clinical outcomes in Korean older adults who had undergone hip fracture surgery. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at Gyeonggi Provincial Medical Center Paju Hospital. Data (N = 231) were obtained between January 2016 and May 2019 using electronic medical records. Delirium was evaluated using a Korean version of the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent t-test, chi-squared test, and logistic regression using SPSS 23.0 software. Results: The incidence of delirium among older adults after hip fracture surgery was 45%. Multiple logistic regression identified higher age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.72, p < 0.001), low albumin level (OR = 2.65, p = 0.005), high creatinine level (OR = 2.97, p =0.003), and dependent mobility status (OR = 3.84, p < 0.001) as risk factors for delirium. Compared to the non-delirium group, the delirium group was more likely to be admitted to a nursing home instead of returning home after discharge, owing to their inability to carry on independent living, and had significantly higher postoperative complications as well as fall, one-year readmission, and mortality rates. Conclusion: Older adults are vulnerable to delirium after hip fracture surgery. Patients who experience delirium are at an elevated risk for complications and worsening of clinical outcomes. Therefore, multidisciplinary action and management efforts are needed. Copyright (C) 2021, Taiwan Society of Geriatric Emergency & Critical Care Medicine.",0
619,"Background Healthcare environment can affect health. Adverse events (AEs) are common because rapid changes in the patients' status can suddenly arise, and have serious consequences, especially in intensive care. The relationship between the design of intensive care units (ICUs) and AEs has not been fully explored. Hence, an intensive care room was refurbished with cyclic lightning, sound absorbents and unique interior, and exterior design to promote health. Aims The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences between a regular and a refurbished intensive care room in risk for AEs among critically ill patients. Design This study retrospectively evaluated associations of AEs and compared the incidence of AEs in patients who were assigned to a multidisciplinary ICU in a refurbished two-bed patient room with patients in the control rooms between 2011 and 2018. Methods There were 1938 patients included in this study (1382 in control rooms; 556 in the intervention room). Descriptive statistics were used to present the experienced AEs. Binary logistic regressions were conducted to estimate the relationship between the intervention/control rooms and variables concerning AEs. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Results For the frequency of AEs, there were no significant differences between the intervention room and the control rooms (10.6% vs 11%, respectively, P < 0.805). No findings indicated the intervention room (the refurbished room) had a significant influence on decreasing the number of experienced AEs in critically ill patients. Conclusions The findings revealed a low incident of AEs in both the intervention room as well as in the control rooms, lower than previously described. However, our study did not find any decreases in the AEs due to the design of the rooms. Relevance to clinical practice Further research is needed to determine the relationship between the physical environment and AEs in critically ill patients.",0
620,"Aims and objectives. With consideration of an environmental concept, this paper explores evidence related to the negative impacts of the intensive care unit environment on patient outcomes and explores the potential counteracting benefits of 'nature-based' nursing interventions as a way to improve care outcomes. Background. The impact of the environment in which a patient is nursed has long been recognised as one determinant in patient outcomes. Whilst the contemporary intensive care unit environment contains many features that support the provision of the intensive therapies the patient requires, it can also be detrimental, especially for long-stay patients. Design. This narrative review considers theoretical and evidence-based literature that supports the adoption of nature-based nursing interventions in intensive care units. Methods. Research and theoretical literature from a diverse range of disciplines including nursing, medicine, psychology, architecture and environmental science were considered in relation to patient outcomes and intensive care nursing practice. Conclusion. There are many nature-based interventions that intensive care unit nurses can implement into their nursing practice to counteract environmental stressors. These interventions can also improve the environment for patients' families and nurses. Relevance to clinical practice. Intensive care unit nurses must actively consider and manage the environment in which nursing occurs to facilitate the best patient outcomes.",0
621,"Background Post-stroke delirium (POD) in patients on stroke units (SU) is associated with an increased risk for complications and poorer clinical outcome. The objective was to reduce the severity of POD by implementing an interprofessional delirium-management. Methods Multicentric quality-improvement project on five SU implementing a delirium-management with pre/post-comparison. Primary outcome was severity of POD, assessed with the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC). Secondary outcome parameters were POD incidence, duration, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), length of stay in SU and hospital, mortality, and others. Results Out of a total of 799 patients, 59.4% (n = 475) could be included with 9.5% (n = 45) being delirious. Implementation of a delirium-management led to reduced POD severity; Nu-DESC median: pre: 3.5 (interquartile range 2.6-4.7) vs. post 3.0 (2.2-4.0), albeit not significant (p = 0.154). Other outcome parameters were not meaningful different. In the post-period, delirium-management could be delivered to 75% (n= 18) of delirious patients, and only 24 (53.3%) of delirious patients required pharmacological treatments. Patients with a more severe stroke and POD remained on their disability levels, compared to similar affected, non-delirious patients who improved. Conclusions Implementation of delirium-management on SU is feasible and can be delivered to most patients, but with limited effects. Nursing interventions as first choice could be delivered to the majority of patients, and only the half required pharmacological treatments. Delirium-management may lead to reduced severity of POD but had only partial effects on duration of POD or length of stay. POD hampers rehabilitation, especially in patients with more severe stroke.",0
622,"Background Pain, agitation, and delirium are associated with negative outcomes in critically ill patients. Reducing variation in pain, agitation, and delirium management among institutions could improve care. Objectives To define opportunities to improve pain, agitation, and delirium management in intensive care units in British Columbia, Canada. Methods A 13-item survey was developed to determine practices for assessing and managing pain, agitation, and delirium. Target participants were persons designated as the most informed about pain, agitation, and delirium management at each of the 30 intensive care units in British Columbia. Main measures were protocol use, assessment tool(s) used and frequency, and management approaches. Results All 30 units responded; half of them had a unitspecific pain algorithm. The Behavioral Pain Scale and the numerical rating scale were the most common tools used to assess pain. Sites reported 15 different approaches to pain management: two-thirds used a sedation assessment tool, but some relied on physician diagnoses to identify sedation. Sites reported 18 different approaches to sedation management: most included an algorithm or order set for sedation management, but the most commonly used approach was individualized management by a clinician (17% for sedation and 30% for agitation). Sites reported 22 different approaches for delirium management: more than two-thirds used a delirium measurement instrument, but some relied on physician diagnoses to identify delirium. Conclusion Variation in assessment and management of pain, agitation, and delirium in British Columbia intensive care units highlights opportunities to improve care.",0
623,Five cases of presumed nicotine withdrawal delirium among brain-injured patients treated in a neurologic intensive care unit are presented. Each patient had a history of heavy tobacco use and experienced dramatic and sustained clinical improvement within hours of transdermal nicotine replacement. These preliminary observations suggest that nicotine withdrawal may be an under-recognized cause of delirium in patients with acute brain injury.,0
624,"Sedation practices in the critical care unit have been trending toward lighter sedation since the start of the new millennium, but patients continue to experience inadequate pain management and excessive sedation. This paper includes a brief examination of the problem of pain management in the ICU; trends in sedation practices, including light sedation and the daily interruption of sedation; and a literature review of analgosedation. While the analgosedation literature is relatively sparse, it offers a promising, patient-centered method for managing the triad of pain, agitation, and delirium, while reducing common complications associated with long-term ventilation. This paper concludes with a recommended method for analgosedation, the nursing implications, and a discussion of limitations and recommendations.

626,"Background Physical restraints are used in intensive care units, particularly among patients at risk for self-terminating necessary treatment interventions, including endotracheal tubes and invasive catheters. Assessments conducted by intensive care unit nurses often influence the collaborative decision to initiate and discontinue restraints in critical care patients. However, little is known about factors that influence the critical thought processes of intensive care unit nurses in determining use of restraints. Objectives To describe nurses' determinants of initiation and discontinuation of restraints in surgical intensive care unit patients. Methods Semistructured interviews were conducted to identify and describe determinants of initiation and discontinuation of physical restraints. Demographic and employment data were collected via questionnaire. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by using conventional content analysis to establish categories and identify themes. Results A total of 13 nurses (mean age 43 [SD, 12] years, 92% female, mean of 18 [SD, 12] years of practice as a registered nurse, 69% bachelor of science in nursing) participated in the study. Content analysis revealed 3 general categories and 8 themes that indicated the thoughtful reflection processes nurses in a surgical intensive care unit use to determine use of restraints. Conclusions Top priorities were ensuring patient safety and comfort. Nurses synthesized factors including practice experience, patient-specific behaviors and risk, and patients' need for devices in determining use of restraints.",0
627,"Nonvocal alert patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting often struggle to communicate due to inaccessible or unavailable tools for augmentative and alternative communication. Innovation of a hand-operated non-touchscreen communication system for nonvocal ICU patients was guided by design concepts including speech output, simplicity, and flexibility. A novel communication tool, the Manually Operated Communication System (MOCS), was developed for use in intensive care settings with patients unable to speak. MOCS is a speech-output technology designed for patients with manual dexterity impairments preventing legible writing. MOCS may have the potential to improve communication for nonvocal patients with limited manual dexterity.",0
628,"Postoperative delirium is associated with worse outcome. The aim of this study was to understand present strategies for delirium screening and therapy in German Post-Anesthesia-Caring-Units (PACU). We designed a German-wide web-based questionnaire which was sent to 922 chairmen of anesthesiologic departments and to 726 anesthetists working in ambulatory surgery. The response rate was 30% for hospital anesthesiologists. 10% (95%-confidence interval: 8-12) of the anesthesiologists applied a standardised screening for delirium. Even though not on a regular basis, in 44% (41-47) of the hospitals, a recommended and validated screening was used, the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDesc) or the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). If delirium was likely to occur, 46% (43-50) of the patients were examined using a delirium tool. 20% (17-23) of the patients were screened in intensive care units. For the treatment of delirium, alpha-2-agonists (83%, 80-85) were used most frequently for vegetative symptoms, benzodiazepines for anxiety in 71% (68-74), typical neuroleptics in 77% (71-82%) of patients with psychotic symptoms and in 20% (15-25) in patients with hypoactive delirium. 45% (39-51) of the respondents suggested no therapy for this entity. Monitoring of delirium is not established as a standard procedure in German PACUs. However, symptom-oriented therapy for postoperative delirium corresponds with current guidelines.",0
629,"Objective: The ABCDEF (Assess, prevent, and manage Pain, Both spontaneous awakening trials and spontaneous breathing trials, Choice of analgesia and sedation, Delirium: assess, prevent, and manage, Early mobility and Exercise, and Family engagement and empowerment) bundle is a path for optimal resource utilization. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge level and views of physicians working at the intensive care units (ICUs) in Turkey, a developing country, on the use of ABCDEF bundle. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was administered to ICU physicians in Turkey, using Supplemental Digital Content 1, on June 20, 2018. The survey was terminated and deactivated on September 30, 2018. Results: A multidisciplinary team oriented for compliance with the ABCDEF bundle was not found to be present in any of the responding ICUs in Turkey. Of 461 participants, 161 (35.1%) were knowledgeable about the bundle. The bundle could not be used due to lack of a team and shortage of trained personnel. Conclusion: The rates of using scales proposed by the ABCDEF bundle were remarkably low although most participants acknowledged that the use of protocols and scales leads to decreased morbidity and mortality rates.",0
630,"Introduction: The most common neurological diagnosis patients hospitalized in ICU is Delirium.Delirium is an acute consciousness disorder that is accompanied by inattention, thinking disorder, and perception disorders that fluctuate over a short period of time. This syndrome is associated with various complications in the hospital and outside the hospital. The purpose of this investigation was identifying the effect of joints range of motion (ROM) exercises on blocking and decreasing the period of delirium in ICU patients. Materials and Methods: 168 patients admitted in ICU wards of Imam Khomeini and Golestan Hospitals of Ahvaz were the subjects of the present study. The patients were examined by the ICDSC Delirium checklist daily, and the joints ROM exercises were performed from the time of admission to the day of discharge, two times a day in the morning and night. Results: There was a significant difference in the levels of delirium between the control and intervention groups after the intervention, using logistic regression model (P =0.006). There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of duration of delirium using Mann-Whitney test (p = 0.003). Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that the ROM exercises of the joints reduced the levels and duration of the delirium. The results of this study can be used to determine the ROM exercises of the joints in the planning of patient care in patients admitted to intensive care units of hospitals by clinical nurses and physiotherapists as well as occupation therapists.",0
631,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the motoric subtypes of delirium in critically ill patients and compare patients aged 65 and older with a younger cohort. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The medical intensive care unit (MICU) of a tertiary care academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred fourteen MICU patients admitted during a process improvement initiative to monitor levels of sedation and delirium. MEASUREMENTS: MICU nursing staff assessed delirium and level of consciousness in all MICU patients at least once per 12-hour shift using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Delirium episodes were categorized as hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed type. RESULTS: Delirium was detected in 112 of 156 (71.8%) subjects aged 65 and older and 263 of 458 (57.4%) subjects younger than 65. Mixed type was most common (54.9%), followed by hypoactive delirium (43.5%) and purely hyperactive delirium (1.6%). Patients aged 65 and older experienced hypoactive delirium at a greater rate than younger patients (41.0% vs 21.6%, P <.001) and never experienced hyperactive delirium. Older age was strongly and independently associated with hypoactive delirium (adjusted odds ratio=3.0, 95% confidence interval=1.7-5.3), compared with no delirium in a model that adjusted for other important determinants of delirium including severity of illness, sedative medication use, and ventilation status. CONCLUSION: Older age is a strong predictor of hypoactive delirium in MICU patients, and this motoric subtype of delirium may be missed in the absence of active monitoring.",0
632,"BackgroundIntensive care unit (ICU) patients experience two affronts to normal 24-h rhythms: largely internal events such as medication and external factors such as light, noise and nursing interventions. Aims and objectivesWe investigated the impact of light variance within an ICU on 24-h rhythmicity of three key physiological parameters: heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and body temperature (BT) in this patient population. DesignPatients were assigned to beds either in the 'light' or 'dark' side within a single ICU. An actigraph continuously recorded light intensity for a 24-72-h period. MethodsMeasurements of HR, MAP and BT were recorded every 30min. ResultsHR, MAP and BT did not follow 24-h rhythmicity in all patients. Higher light exposure in the Light Side of the ICU (122.3 versus 50.6 lx) was related to higher HR (89.4 versus 79.8bpm), which may translate to clinically relevant outcomes in a larger sample. Duration of stay, the one clinical outcome measured in this study, showed no significant variation between the groups (p=0.147). ConclusionsICU patients are exposed to varying light intensities depending on bed positioning relative to natural sunlight, affecting the 24-h rhythm of HR. Larger, well-controlled studies also investigating the effect of relevant light intensity are indicated. Relevance to clinical practiceLight is a variable that can be manipulated in the constrained environment of an ICU, thus offering an avenue for relatively unobtrusive interventions.",0
633,"Patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) may risk disruption of their circadian rhythm. In an intervention research project a cycled lighting system was set up in an ICU room to support patients' circadian rhythm. Part I aimed to compare experiences of the lighting environment in two rooms with different lighting environments by lighting experiences questionnaire. The results indicated differences in advantage for the patients in the intervention room (n=48), in perception of daytime brightness (p =0.004). In nighttime, greater lighting variation (p =0.005) was found in the ordinary room (n = 52). Part II aimed to describe experiences of lighting in the room equipped with the cycled lighting environment. Patients (n=19) were interviewed and the results were presented in categories: ""A dynamic lighting environment"", ""Impact of lighting on patients' steep"", The impact of lighting/lights on circadian rhythm"" and The Lighting calms"". Most had experiences from sleep disorders and half had nightmares/sights and circadian rhythm disruption. Nearly all were pleased with the cycled lighting environment, which together with daylight supported their circadian rhythm. In night's actual lighting levels helped patients and staff to connect which engendered feelings of calm. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

634,"Purpose/Objective: The aftermath of treatment for critical illness and/or critical injury in the intensive care unit (ICU) often includes persisting cognitive and emotional morbidities as well as severe physical deconditioning (a constellation termed post-intensive care syndrome, or PICS), but most patients do not receive psychological services before they enter the inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF). Although a burgeoning literature guides the efforts of critical care providers to reduce risk factors for PICS - for example, reducing the use of sedatives and enacting early mobilization, there is need for a corresponding awareness among IRF psychologists and other providers that the post-ICU patient often arrives in a state of significantly reduced capacity, with persisting cognitive impairments and acute psychological distress. Many are at risk for long-term complications of posttraumatic stress disorder, general anxiety and/or clinical depression, and assuredly all have experienced a profound life disruption. This paper offers a multilevel perspective on the adaptation of post-ICU patients during inpatient rehabilitation, with discussion of the psychologist's role in education and intervention. Research Method/Design: Clinical review paper. Results: NA. Conclusions: To optimize response to rehabilitation, it is important to understand the behavior of post-ICU patients within a full biopsychosocial context including debility, cognitive and emotional impairment, disruption of role identities, and environmental factors. The psychologist can provide education about predictable barriers to participation for the post-ICU patient, and guide individual, family and team interventions to ameliorate those barriers.",0
635,"Often, pediatric intensive care environments are not conducive to healing the sick. Critically ill children experience disruptions in their circadian rhythms, which can contribute to delayed recovery and poor outcomes. We aim to test the hypothesis that children managed via RESTORE Resilience (R-2), a nurse-implemented chronotherapeutic bundle, will experience restorative circadian rhythms compared to children receiving usual care. In this two-phased, prospective cohort study, two separate pediatric intensive care units in the United Sates will enroll a total of 20 baseline subjects followed by 40 intervention subjects, 6 months to less than 18 years of age, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. During the intervention phase, we will implement the R-2 bundle, which includes: (1) a focused effort to replicate the child's pre-hospitalization daily routine, (2) cycled day-night lighting and sound modulation, (3) minimal yet effective sedation (RESTORE), (4) nighttime fasting with bolus enteral daytime feedings, (5) early progressive mobility (PICU Up!), (6) continuity in nursing care, and (7) parent diaries. Our primary outcome is circadian activity ratio post-extubation. We hypothesize that children receiving R-2 will experience restored circadian rhythms as evidenced by decreased nighttime activity while in the PICU. Our exploratory outcomes include salivary melatonin levels; electroencephalogram (EEG) slow-wave activity; R-2 feasibility, adherence, and system barriers; levels of patient comfort; exposure to sedative medications; time to physiological stability; and parent perception of being well cared for. This paper describes the design, rationale, and implementation of R-2.",0
636,"Background: Dysfunctional ventilatory weaning response (DVWR) is characterized by interrupted and prolonged weaning. This reflective analysis presents how using nursing diagnoses in critical care can raise awareness of, and provide strategies for, managing problems related to ventilatory weaning. Aim: To examine and reflect upon why one patient took so long to wean from the ventilator using the structured approach of instrumental case study and nursing diagnosis to explain aspects of the weaning process. Analysis: This case study examines one patient's experiences around ventilatory weaning using selected nursing diagnoses, exploring the implications that physiological, social, emotional and psychological factors have on both weaning and healing processes in critical care. By using dialogue, an explicit texture is presented of how one patient felt, with particular resonance to the relationships she had and the impact they made. Various nursing diagnoses proved useful in determining why this patient had an extended weaning trajectory and included DVWR, ineffective breathing pattern, impaired spontaneous ventilation, anxiety and impaired verbal communication. There were specific points of interest, in particular her anxiety, which proved a major factor, and her significantly improved functional status after the critical care episode. A DVWR may be minimized by nursing presence, reassurance and respect for patient autonomy. Complex anatomy and physiology contributes to protracted weaning and a DVWR and is compounded by anxiety. Furthermore, there is a significant element of nursing care, timely reassurance and presence, which can have a positive impact on patient well-being. Conclusions: This reflective analysis highlights the benefits and importance of the nurse-patient relationship during what was a very protracted ventilatory wean. This shared trajectory enabled significant patient empowerment, and this case study gives the patient the voice she temporarily lost.",0
637,"Background: Early mobilization (EM) is associated with reduced physical disability post-intensive care (PD PIC). Yet, contextual factors facilitate or impede delivery of EM in the intensive care unit (ICU). Only 45% of ICUs in the United States routinely practice EM despite its recognized benefits. Objectives: To analyze the evidence on the relationship between critical care EM, PD PIC, and personal (patient-level) factors, using the theoretical lens of theWorld Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). Method: The Whittemore and Knafl methodology for integrative reviews and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) reporting guidelines were followed. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies (n = 38) that evaluated EM and 1 or more domains of the World Health Organization ICF were included. Quality was appraised using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. Study characteristics were evaluated for common themes and relationships. The ICF domains and subdomains pertaining to each study were synthesized. Results: Early mobilization delivery was influenced by personal factors. Deeper sedation level, the presence of delirium, higher patient acuity, the presence of medical devices, and patient weight were identified barriers to EMdelivery. Patient engagement in EM was associated with improved delivery. Patients who enjoyed rehabilitation were more likely to demonstrate improvement in functional impairment than those who did not enjoy rehabilitation. Discussion: Early mobilization is associated with reduced PD PIC, yet numerous contextual factors affect the delivery of EM in the ICU. Further study of patient-level factors and EM must explore the relationship between patient engagement, baseline demographics, and functional status at ICU admission, patient-level considerations for decisions to mobilize, and EM in the ICU. This research is critical to improving the delivery of EM in the ICU and reducing PD PIC.",0
638,"Early mobilization of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is safe, feasible, and beneficial. However, implementation of early mobility as part of routine clinical care can be challenging. The objective of this review is to identify barriers to early mobilization and discuss strategies to overcome such barriers. Based on a literature search, we synthesize data from 40 studies reporting 28 unique barriers to earlymobility, of which 14 (50%) were patientrelated, 5 (18%) structural, 5 (18%) ICU cultural, and 4 (14%) process-related barriers. These barriers varied across ICUs and within disciplines, depending on the ICU patient population, setting, attitude, and ICU culture. To overcome the identified barriers, over 70 strategies were reported and are synthesized in this review, including: implementation of safety guidelines; use of mobility protocols; interprofessional training, education, and rounds; and involvement of physician champions. Systematic efforts to change ICUculture to prioritize early mobilization using an interprofessional approach and multiple targeted strategies are important components of successfully implementing earlymobility in clinical practice.",0
639,"Introduction: Postoperative delirium is common, with a reported incidence of 11% to 80% in critically ill patients. Delirium is an independent prognostic factor for poor hospital outcomes. Low vitamin D concentrations are associated with a decline in cognitive function. We therefore tested the hypothesis that low preoperative serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations are associated with postoperative delirium in critically ill patients. Method: We conducted a retrospective analysis of adults in a surgical intensive care unit for at least 48 hours immediately after non-cardiac and non-neurosurgical operations at Cleveland Clinic between 2013 and 2018. Delirium was assessed by trained nurses using CAM-ICU twice daily for the initial 5 postoperative days. Any positive value was considered evidence of delirium. We assessed the association between 25(OH)D concentrations within a year before surgery and the incidence of postoperative delirium using logistic regression, adjusted for potential confounders. A linear spline term with a knot at 30 ng/ml, the threshold for normal 25(OH)D concentration, was added to accommodate a nonlinear relationship between 25(OH)D concentrations and delirium. Results: We included 632 patients, who had a mean (SD) 25(OH)D concentration of 25 (15) ng/ml; 55% (346/632) experienced delirium. We observed an adjusted odds ratio of 1.4 (95% CI: [1.1, 1.8], P = 0.01) for delirium per 10 ng/ml decrease in 25(OH)D concentrations when patients' 25(OH)D concentrations were less than 30 ng/ml. In patients whose 25(OH)D concentrations were at least 30 ng/ml, the adjusted odds ratio was 0.9 (95% CI: [0.7, 1.1], P = 0.36). Conclusion: Preoperative 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with postoperative delirium in patients whose concentrations are below the normal threshold, but not at concentrations >= 30 ng/ml. A trial will be needed to determine whether the relationship is causal, and whether vitamin D supplementation before surgery might reduce the incidence of delirium.",0
640,"Purpose: To describe strategies, culled from experience, for responding to several recruitment challenges in an ongoing randomized clinical trial of delirium in persons with dementia. dOrganizing Construct: Delirium in people with dementia is common across all cultures. Little research supports the use of specific interventions for delirium. Recruitment of an adequate sample is critical to the validity of findings from intervention studies that form the foundation for evidence-based practice. Methods: The trial referenced in this article tests the efficacy of cognitive stimulation for resolving delirium in people with dementia. Participants are recruited at the time of admission to one of eight community-based skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). Eligible participants are 65 years of age or older and community dwelling, and have a diagnosis of dementia and delirium. Recruitment challenges and strategies were identified during weekly team meetings over a 2-year period. Findings: Recruitment challenges include factors in the external and internal environment and the participants and their families. Strategies that address these challenges include early site evaluation and strong communication approaches with staff, participants, and families. Conclusions: The recruitment of an adequate sample of acutely ill older adults with dementia in SNFs can pose a challenge to investigators and threaten the validity of findings. Recruitment strategies that help improve the validity of future studies are described. Clinical Relevance: Worldwide, over 100 million people will have dementia by 2050, placing them at increased risk for delirium. Recruitment strategies that improve the quality of nursing research and, by extension, the care and prevention of delirium in older adults with dementia during rehabilitation in SNFs are greatly needed.",0
641,"Background Deliberate screening allows detection of health risks that are otherwise not noticeable and allows expedient intervention to minimize complications and optimize outcomes, especially during critical events like hospitalization. Little research has evaluated the usefulness of screening performance and outcome indicators as measures to differentiate nursing quality, although policymakers are using them to benchmark hospitals. Objectives The aims of this study were to examine hospital performance based on nursing-sensitive screening indicators and to assess associations with hospital characteristics and nursing-sensitive outcomes for patients. Methods A secondary use of nursing-sensitive data from the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate was performed, including the mandatory screening and outcome indicators related to delirium, malnutrition, pain and pressure ulcers. The sample consisted of all 93 hospitals in the Netherlands in 2011. High- and low-performing hospitals were determined based on the overall proportion of screened patients. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance were used to examine screening performances in relation to hospital characteristics and nursing-sensitive outcomes. Results Over all hospitals, the average screening rates ranged from 59% (delirium) to 94% (pain). Organizational characteristics were not different in high- and low-performing hospitals. The hospitals with the best overall screening performances had significantly better results regarding protein intake within malnourished patients (p < .01). For mortality, marginal significant effects did not remain after controlling for organizational structures. No associations were found with prevalence of pressure ulcers and patient self-reported pain scores. Discussion The screening for patient risks is an important nursing task. Our findings suggest that nursing-sensitive screening indicators may be relevant measures for benchmarking nursing quality in hospitals.

Early mobilization and rehabilitation programs offer a promising approach for mitigating the effects of PICS-p in oncology patients but have not yet been studied in this high-risk population. Methods We describe the development and feasibility of implementing an early mobility quality improvement initiative in a dedicated pediatric onco-critical care unit. Our primary outcomes include the percentage of patients with consults for rehabilitation services within 72 h of admission, the percentage of patients who are mobilized within 72 h of admission, and the percentage of patients with a positive delirium screen after 48 h of admission. Results Between January 2019 and June 2020, we significantly increased the proportion of patients with consults ordered for rehabilitation services within 72 h of admission from 25 to 56% (p<0.001), increased the percentage of patients who were mobilized within 72 h of admission to the intensive care unit from 21 to 30% (p=0.02), and observed a decrease in patients with positive delirium screens from 43 to 37% (p=0.46). The early mobility initiative was not associated with an increase in unplanned extubations, unintentional removal of central venous catheters, or injury to patient or staff. Conclusions Our experience supports the safety and feasibility of early mobility initiatives in pediatric onco-critical care. Additional evaluation is needed to determine the effects of early mobilization on patient outcomes.",0
644,"Rationale: Poor sleep quality is common in the intensive care unit (ICU) and may be associated with adverse outcomes. Hence, ICU-based efforts to promote sleep are gaining attention, motivating interest in methods to measure sleep in critically ill patients. Actigraphy evaluates rest and activity by algorithmically processing gross motor activity data, usually collected by a noninvasive wristwatch-like accelerometer device. In critically ill patients, actigraphy has been used as a surrogate measure of sleep; however, its use has not been systematically reviewed. Objectives: To conduct a systematic review of ICU-based studies that used actigraphy as a surrogate measure of sleep, including its feasibility, validity, and reliability as a measure of sleep in critically ill patients. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Proquest, and Web of Science for studies that used actigraphy to evaluate sleep in five or more patients in an ICU setting. Results: Our search yielded 4,869 citations, with 13 studies meeting eligibility criteria. These 13 studies were conducted in 10 countries, and eight (62%) were published since 2008. Across the 13 studies, the mean total sleep time of patients in the ICU, as estimated using actigraphy, ranged from 4.4 to 7.8 hours at nighttime and from 7.1 to 12.1 hours over a 24-hour period, with 1.4 to 49.0 mean nocturnal awakenings and a sleep efficiency of 61 to 75%. When compared side-by-side with other measures of sleep (polysomnography, nurse assessments, and patient questionnaires), actigraphy consistently yielded higher total sleep time and sleep efficiency, fewer nighttime awakenings (vs. polysomnography), and more overall awakenings (vs. nurse assessment and patient questionnaires). None of the studies evaluated the association between actigraphy-based measures of sleep and outcomes of patients in the ICU. Conclusions: In critically ill patients, actigraphy is being used more frequently as a surrogate measure of sleep; however, because actigraphy only measures gross motor activity, its ability to estimate sleep is limited by the processing algorithm used. Prior ICU-based studies involving actigraphy were heterogeneous and lacked data regarding actigraphy-based measures of sleep and patient outcomes. Larger, more rigorous and standardized studies are needed to better understand the role of actigraphy in evaluating sleep and sleep-related outcomes in critically ill patients.",0
646,"Objective: The purpose of this systematic review was to critically evaluate the safety and effectiveness of various complementary health approaches (CHAs) in treating symptoms experienced by critically ill adults. Methods: The review was completed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement. Electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Education Resources Information Center, Medline, PsychInfo) were searched for studies published from 1997-2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), in English with terms ICU/critical care, music, Reiki, therapeutic touch, healing touch, aromatherapy, essential oil, reflexology, chronotherapy, or light therapy were eligible for inclusion. Studies conducted outside the ICU, involving multiple CHAs, or enrolling pediatric patients were excluded. Data were extracted and assessed independently by two authors and reviewed by two additional authors. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess study quality. Results: Thirty-two RCTs were included involving 2,987 critically ill adults. CHAs evaluated included music (n = 19), nature based sounds (NBSs) (n = 4), aromatherapy (n = 3), light therapy (n = 2), massage (n = 2), and reflexology (n = 2). Half of all studies had a high risk of bias for randomization but had low or unclear biases for other categories. No study-related adverse events or safety-related concerns were reported. There were statistically significant improvements in pain (music, NBSs), anxiety (music, NBSs, aromatherapy, massage, reflexology), agitation (NBSs, reflexology), sleep (music, aromatherapy, reflexology), level of arousal (music, massage), and duration of mechanical ventilation (music, reflexology). Conclusions: Evidence suggests CHAs may reduce the symptom burden of critically ill adults.",0
647,"Background: Critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) have restricted exposure to natural light throughout the day. As a result, they are more prone to undergo disruptions in circadian rhythmicity and sleep patterns, which may contribute to the development of delirium. As a measure to synchronize to the patterns of natural sunlight, EWINDOW has been proved to prevent delirium in some studies. Hence, the aim of this systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of EWINDOW so as to prevent delirium. Methods: From January 2012 to December 2021, electronic databases such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, Excerpts Medica database, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Wan Fang, and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature are aimed to look for appropriate randomized controlled trials to evaluate the therapeutic impact of EWINDOW on delirium prevention. To be more exact, related studies are chosen, data is retrieved and the risk of bias is examined, 'hen a meta-analysis is carried out in order. Results: The goal of this study is to show how effective EWINDOW is at preventing delirium in ICU. The incidence and duration of delirium are included in our outcome measures. Conclusions: This review evaluates related studies on the therapeutic effects of EWINDOW on the prevention of delirium in the ICUs. Dissemination and ethics: The findings of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. As the study relies on publicly available data, no ethical approval is required. Furthermore, throughout the data analysis procedure, anonymity is protected.",0

649,"Purpose To assess the clinical implementation and barriers to completing the 4AT for delirium in general medical and geriatric patients over 75 years upon admission to Wellington and Kenepuru Hospitals during the first eight months of 2017, 2018 and 2019. Methods Retrospective data from electronic health records were analysed using an explanatory-sequential mixed-methods approach. The initial quantitative phase measured doctors' adherence to the 4AT and the rate of positive 4ATs (>= 4). The subsequent qualitative phase identified doctors' main reasons for omitting the 4AT through conventional content analysis. Results The quantitative population included 7799 acute admissions (mean age 84, 58.2% female). There was good clinical implementation of the 4AT, evidenced by an overall adherence rate of 83.2% and a rate of positive 4ATs of 14.8% that is in keeping with expected delirium rates in similar settings. The qualitative sample consisted of 875 acute admissions (mean age 84, 56.3% female) with documented reasons for omitting the 4AT. The main barriers to completing the 4AT were: reduced patient alertness, communication barriers (language, deafness, aphasia and dysarthria), prioritising patients' wellness and comfort (addressing critical illnesses, symptoms, end-of-life issues and promoting sleep), pre-existing cognitive disorders, and unstructured delirium assessments. Conclusion Adherence to the 4AT was high and sustainable in both hospitals. Most barriers to completing the 4AT were potentially avoidable. Education about the 4AT in relation to these barriers may improve its implementation. Key summary pointsAim To assess the clinical implementation and barriers to completing the 4AT for delirium in general medical and geriatric patients over 75 years upon admission to Wellington and Kenepuru Hospitals. Findings The 4AT is a feasible and sustainable tool for the assessment of delirium in the hospital setting. Most of the identified barriers to completing the 4AT are potentially reversible. Message Implementation of the 4AT may improve through education about these barriers and emphasising its validity in specific groups.",0
650,"Background: Caring for lightly sedated intubated patients increases caregiver workload. Therefore, providing light sedation to intubated patients may depend on nursing experience. We retrospectively investigated the association between conversion from light to deep sedation and nursing experience in intensive care units (ICUs) with a 1 : 2 nurse-to-patient ratio. Methods: It was a historical cohort study performed in ICUs in a university hospital. One hundred and eighty-four patients requiring more than 72 hours of mechanical ventilation after ICU admission were analyzed. To avoid channeling bias, propensity score analysis was used to generate a set of matched cases (managed by trainee nurses) and controls (managed by experienced nurses), yielding 72 matched patient pairs. Primary (change from light to deep sedation) and secondary outcomes (sedation level after light sedation cancelation, ICU stay, and intubation duration) were compared. Results: Conversion from light to deep sedation was equally preferred by trainee nurses, with conversion rates of > 70% regardless of matching procedure (P = 0.663). Deeper sedation was preferred by experienced nurses (P = 0.025). Management by experienced nurses significantly prolonged ICU stay (16.3 vs. 21.4, P = 0.033). Additional multivariable logistic regression revealed that visual disturbance (OR [95% CI] = 4.3 [1.4-13.3], P = 0.012), Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) (OR [95% CI] = 2.2 [1.7-2.9], P < 0.0001), and dexmedetomidine dose 48 h post-ICU admission (OR [95% CI] = 0.81 [0.69-0.96], P = 0.016) were independently associated with giving up light sedation. Conclusions: Conversion from light to deep sedation was preferred in > 70% of mechanically ventilated patients in ICUs with a 1 : 2 nurse-to-patient ratio. Rates of sedation level changes for managing mechanically ventilated patients were similar between trainee and experienced nurses. However, experienced nurses preferred significantly deeper sedation than trainee nurses.",0
651,"Study Objectives To measure concordance between different intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians and a consensus group of electrophysiology (EP) cardiologists for use of a common rate-corrected QT interval (QTc)-prolonging medication in cases containing different potential risk factor(s) for torsade de pointes (TdP). Design Prospective case-based evaluation. Setting Academic medical center with 320 beds. Subjects Medical house staff (MDs) and ICU nurses (RNs) from one center and select critical care pharmacists (PHs). Intervention Completion of a survey containing 10 hypothetical ICU cases in which patients had agitated delirium for which a psychiatrist recommended intravenous haloperidol 5mg every 6hours. Each case contained different potential risk factor(s) for TdP in specific combinations. A group of five EP cardiologists agreed that haloperidol use was safe in five cases and not safe in five cases. Measurements and Main Results For each case, participants were asked to document whether they would administer haloperidol, to provide a rationale for their decision, and to state their level of confidence in that decision. Most clinicians (92 of 115 [80%]) invited to participate completed the cases. Among the five cases where EP cardiologists agreed that haloperidol was not safe, 29% of respondents felt that haloperidol was safe. Conversely, in the five cases where EP cardiologists felt haloperidol was safe, 21% of respondents believed that it was not safe. Overall respondent-EP cardiologist agreement for haloperidol use across the 10 cases was moderate (=0.51). MDs and PHs were in agreement with the EP cardiologists more than RNs (p=0.03). Interprofessional variability existed for the TdP risk factors each best identified. Clinician confidence correlated with EP cardiologist concordance for MDs (p=0.002) and PHs (p=0.0002), but not for RNs (p=0.69). Conclusion When evaluating use of a QTc interval-prolonging medication, ICU clinicians often fail to identify the TdP risk factors that EP cardiologists feel should prevent its use. Clinician-EP cardiologist concordance varies by the specific risk factor(s) for TdP and the ICU professional conducting the assessment.",0
652,"Aims and objectivesThis study investigated whether an intensive care unit (ICU) stay is associated with persistent pain, anxiety and agitation in critically ill older patients. BackgroundPatients hospitalised in the ICU are at risk for experiencing pain, anxiety and agitation, but long-term consequences for older patients have rarely been investigated. DesignProspective nonrandomised longitudinal study. MethodsPain, anxiety and agitation, measured with a numeric rating scale (0-10), were assessed in older patients (65years) hospitalised in the medical-surgical ICU of a university hospital. Agitation during the ICU was assessed with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Data collection occurred during the ICU, one week after the stay and six and 12months after hospital discharge. Data were collected from an age-matched community-based comparison group at recruitment and after six and 12months. Study recruitment took place from December 2008-April 2011. ResultsThis study included 145 older patients (ICU group) and 146 comparison group participants. Pain was higher in the ICU group one week after discharge, although pain levels in general were low. Both groups reported no or low levels of pain after six and 12months. Anxiety levels in general were low, although higher in the ICU group one week after ICU discharge. After six and 12months, anxiety in both groups was comparable. Throughout the study, levels of agitation were similar in both groups. ConclusionsCritically ill older patients did not experience increased pain, anxiety or agitation 12months after an ICU stay. Relevance to clinical practiceThis study positively shows that an ICU stay is not associated with persistent pain, anxiety and agitation thus providing additional information to older patients and their families when making intensive care treatment decisions. Adequate management of pain during and after an ICU stay may minimise the suffering of older patients.",0
653,"Background: Although faculty design Master of Science in Nursing courses to help students acquire knowledge in practice, evidence gaps exist in the literature. The purpose of this study was to describe problems identified by practicing graduate nursing students, match them with themes from the National Institute of Nursing Research, determine if sufficient published literature exists to guide research-based interventions, and identify gaps. Method: Using the National Institute's research themes as the framework, 215 de-identified student papers were selected using two courses-a research methods/biostatistics and an ethics course. The Krippendorff method was used to identify practice-based problems and research-based interventions with gaps in the literature. Discussion: Students identified pain, sleep difficulties, delirium, falls, hospital-acquired infections, noise, hypothermia, and stress as priority practice-based problems. Conclusion: A lack of clear or administratively enforced clinical guidelines or educational strategies was identified as an area with information gaps in the literature.",0
654,"Purpose: The purpose of the study is to identify predictors of underuse of sedation scales and daily sedation interruption (DSI). Methods: We surveyed all physicians and seven nurses in every Belgian intensive care unit (ICU), addressing practices and perceptions on guideline recommendations. Underuse was defined for sedation scales as use less than 3x per day and for DSI as never using it Classification trees and logistic regressions identified predictors of underuse. Results: Underuse of sedation scales and DSI was found for 16.6% and 32.5% of clinicians, respectively. Strongest predictors of underuse of sedation scales were agreeing that using them daily takes much time and being a physician ( rather than a nurse). Further predictors were confidence in their ability to measure sedation levels without using scales, for physicians, and nurse/ICU bed ratios less than 1.98, for nurses. The strongest predictor of underuse of DSI among physicians was the perception that DSI impairs patients' comfort. Among nurses, lack of familiarity with DSI, region, and agreeing DSI should only be performed upon medical orders best predicted underuse. Conclusions: Workload considerations hamper utilization of sedation scales. Poor familiarity, for nurses, and negative perception of impact on patients' comfort, for physicians, both reduce DSI utilization. Targeting these obstacles is essential while designing quality improvement strategies to minimize sedative use. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
655,"Background Although delirium is typically an acute reversible cognitive impairment, its presence is associated with devastating impact on both short-term and long-term outcomes for critically ill patients. Advances in our understanding of the negative impact of delirium on patient outcomes have prompted trials evaluating multiple pharmacological interventions. However, considerable uncertainty surrounds the relative benefits and safety of available pharmacological interventions for this population. Objectives Primary objective 1. To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions for treatment of delirium on duration of delirium in critically ill adults with confirmed or documented high risk of delirium Secondary objectives To assess the following: 1. effects of pharmacological interventions on delirium-free and coma-free days; days with coma; delirium relapse; duration of mechanical ventilation; intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay; mortality; and long-term outcomes (e.g. cognitive; discharge disposition; health-related quality of life); and 2. the safety of such treatments for critically ill adult patients. Search methods We searched the following databases from their inception date to 21 March 2019: Ovid MEDLINE (R), Ovid MEDLINE (R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase Classic+Embase, and PsycINFO using the Ovid platform. We also searched the Cochrane Library on Wiley, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science. We performed a grey literature search of relevant databases and websites using the resources listed in Grey Matters developed by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). We also searched trial registries and abstracts from annual scientific critical care and delirium society meetings. Selection criteria We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including quasi-RCTs, of any pharmacological (drug) for treatment of delirium, in critically ill adults. The drug intervention was to be compared to another active drug treatment, placebo, or a non-pharmacological intervention (e.g. mobilization). We did not apply any restrictions in terms of drug class, dose, route of administration, or duration of delirium or drug exposure. We defined critically ill patients as those treated in an ICU of any specialty (e.g. burn, cardiac, medical, surgical, trauma) or high-dependency unit. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified studies from the search results; four review authors (in pairs) performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently. We performed data synthesis through pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA). Our hypothetical network structure was designed to be analysed at the drug class level and illustrated a network diagram of 'nodes' (i.e. drug classes) and 'edges' (i.e. comparisons between different drug classes from existing trials), thus describing a treatment network of all possible comparisons between drug classes. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to GRADE, as very low, low, moderate, or high. Main results We screened 7674 citations, from which 14 trials with 1844 participants met our inclusion criteria. Ten RCTs were placebo-controlled, and four reported comparisons of different drugs. Drugs examined in these trials were the following: antipsychotics (n = 10), alpha(2) agonists (n = 3; all dexmedetomidine), statins (n = 2), opioids (n = 1; morphine), serotonin antagonists (n = 1; ondansetron), and cholinesterase (CHE) inhibitors (n = 1; rivastigmine). Only one of these trials consistently used non-pharmacological interventions that are known to improve patient outcomes in both intervention and control groups. Eleven studies (n = 1153 participants) contributed to analysis of the primary outcome. Results of the NMA showed that the intervention with the smallest ratio of means (RoM) (i.e. most preferred) compared with placebo was the alpha(2) agonise dexmedetomidine (0.58; 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.26 to 1.27; surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) 0.895; moderate-quality evidence). In order of descending SUCRA values (best to worst), the next best.interventions were atypical antipsychotics (RoM 0.80, 95% CrI 0.50 to 1.11; SUCRA 0.738; moderate-quality evidence), opioids (RoM 0.88, 95% CrI 0.37 to 2.01; SUCRA 0.578; very-low quality evidence), and typical antipsychotics (RoM 0.96, 95% CrI 0.64 to1.36; SUCRA 0.468; high-quality evidence). The NMAs of multiple secondary outcomes revealed that only the alpha(2) agonist dexmedetomidine was associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (RoM 0.55,95% CrI 0.34 to 0.89; moderate-quality evidence), and the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with a longer ICU stay (RoM 2.19, 95% CrI 1.47 to 3.27; moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or, when reported, were rare; pair-wise analysis of QTc prolongation in seven studies did not show significant differences between antipsychotics, ondansetron, dexmedetomidine, and placebo. Authors' conclusions We identified trials of varying quality that examined six different drug classes for treatment of delirium in critically ill adults. We found evidence that the alpha(2) agonist dexmedetomidine may shorten delirium duration, although this small effect (compared with placebo) was seen in pairwise analyses based on a single study and was not seen in the NMA results. Alpha(2) agonises also ranked best for duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, whereas the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with longer ICU stay. We found no evidence of a difference between placebo and any drug in terms of delirium-free and coma-free days, days with coma, physical restraint use, length of stay, long-term cognitive outcomes, or mortality. No studies reported delirium relapse, resolution of symptoms, or quality of life. The ten ongoing studies and the six studies awaiting classification that we identified, once published and assessed, may alter the conclusions of the review.",0
656,"Delirium is an acute attention and cognitive dysfunction, adversely affecting functional outcomes and mortality. As many as half of hospitalized right brain stroke survivors may develop delirium. Further, about 50% of right stroke patients experience spatial neglect, impairing safety and recovery. In this review we explore the brain mechanisms, which may explain the high incidence of delirium and spatial neglect after right-brain stroke. We suggest that brain networks for spatial attention and arousal, composed of ascending projections from the midbrain nuclei and integrating dorsal and ventral cortical and limbic components, may underlie impairments in delirium and spatial neglect. We propose that lateralized deficits in spatial neglect may arise because cortical and limbic components of these functional networks are disproportionally impaired by right-brain strokes, and that spatial neglect may lower the threshold for developing delirium. An improved understanding of the brain basis of delirium and spatial neglect could provide a critical biomarker for initiating preventive care in stroke patients at high risk of hospital morbidity and loss of independence.",0
657,"Background Delirium in cardiac surgery patients is common and is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and hospital stay as well as higher mortality. Protocols may improve outcome. In our cardiac surgery intensive care unit (ICU), patients with delirium have not received standardized treatment so far. Hypothesis In cardiac surgery ICU patients, standardized delirium management will lead after a 4-week introduction, compared to nonstandardized treatment, to a reduction of delirium duration. Methods Prospective before/after study to evaluate a quality improvement project for delirium management over 12 weeks including 140 patients. Inclusion criteria: (a)& x202f;>= 18 years, (b) consent for research with their data. Exclusion criteria: (a) palliative status, (b) present during both the before/after phase, (c) pregnancy, (d) included in a competitive study, or (e) delirium not assessable. The implementation includes the introduction of a protocol with interprofessional training, bedside-teaching, pocket cards, posters, and reminders. The primary outcome is the duration of delirium, assessed four times a day with validated instruments. Secondary outcome measures include delirium incidence, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in ICU and hospital, mortality, nursing/therapeutic interventions, cumulative doses of delirium-related drugs, and complications of delirium for a follow-up of 28 days. Empirical data will be analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Objectives The purpose of the study is a reduction of the duration and frequency of delirium in cardiac ICU patients and will provide evidence of the effect size of the introduction of a delirium management.",0
658,"Background: Critically ill patients experience various types of pain that are difficult to assess because patients cannot communicate verbally due to artificial airways and sustained sedation. The Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) objectively evaluates patients' pain. Aims: This study aimed to re-assess the reliability and validity of the Japanese version (CPOT-J) and to reveal limitations of behaviors specific to mechanically ventilated patients. Design: Secondary analysis of observational pilot study and case report. Participants: Methods: We obtained consent preoperatively from 40 cardiovascular surgery patients. CPOT-J scores were evaluated immediately before, immediately after, and 20 minutes after painful stimulation. Interrater reliability was determined by the researcher and 18 ICU nurses (minimum one-year ICU experience). Validity was examined by comparing CPOT-J with vital sign values and patients' self-reports of pain. Two cases revealed the tool's characteristics: one score was consistent with patient reports while the other was not. Results: We evaluated pain in 34 patients (26 men, 8 women; mean age = 66.8 years). Weighted kappa scores ranged from 0.48 to 0.94. The tool only correlated with changes in systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure. Case studies indicated that the tool effectively evaluated mid-sternum-wound pain, but not back pain at rest. Conclusions: The CPOT-J can assess pain in mechanically ventilated patients, but being immobile results in a score of 0 for body movement (e.g., being immobile while feeling back pain) and is a limitation of the scoring.

660,"Patients staying in the intensive care unit (ICU) require constant monitoring and numerous nursing interventions performed as needed, irrespective of daytime or night-time. The disturbing effect of nocturnal nursing interventions and their contribution to sleep disruptions are unclear. The review analysed nocturnal nursing interventions, and their character, frequency and effects on sleep quality. The databases CINAHL, PubMed and Scopus were searched to identify and subsequently evaluate 19 studies (1,531 patients) meeting the algorithm used. Although nocturnal nursing interventions provided to ICU patients were frequent and varied, they were responsible for only a minority of observed sleep disruptions. The most frequent nocturnal intervention was Vital signs monitoring (Nursing Interventions Classification, 6,680). Implementation of sleep protocols, of which an integral part is clustering and planning of nocturnal interventions, appears to be effective. The review suggests that nursing interventions are not the main cause of sleep disruptions in the ICU. In an effort to improve the quality of sleep in ICU patients, other factors causing disturbance need to be addressed as well. The current trend is more careful planning of nursing care, clustering of interventions and minimizing nocturnal disruptions to allow patients at least one uninterrupted sleep cycle (90 min).",0
661,"OBJECTIVE Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), manifests with a wide spectrum of presentations. Most reports of COVID-19 highlight fever and upper respiratory symptoms as the dominant initial presentations, consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines regarding suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, atypical presentations of this disease have been evolving since the initial outbreak of the pandemic in December 2019. We report a case of an older male patient who presented at our hospital with an unusual manifestation of COVID-19. DESIGN Brief report. SETTING A university hospital in Saudi Arabia. PARTICIPANT A 73-year-old man who presented with confusion in the absence of any respiratory symptoms or fever. INTERVENTION The patient was initially admitted with delirium and underwent a further work-up. MEASUREMENTS Given his recent history of domestic travel and the declaration of a global COVID-19 pandemic status, the patient was administered a swab test for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS The patient's positive test led to a diagnosis of COVID-19. Although he began to experience a spiking fever and mild upper respiratory symptoms, he recovered rapidly with no residual sequela. CONCLUSION The recognition of atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection, such as delirium, is critical to the timely diagnosis, provision of appropriate care, and avoidance of outbreaks within healthcare facilities during this pandemic.",0
662,"Background Thirst is one of the most intense and distressing symptoms experienced by patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), and no validated measurement tools exist. Validating a thirst measurement tool for the ICU population could be a first step in gaining a better understanding of thirst in ICU patients and aid the development and implementation of strategies regarding the prevention and control of thirst. Aim The objective of this study was to determine the validity and reliability of the ""Thirst distress scale for patients with heart failure (TDS-HF)"" in measuring thirst distress in adult ICU patients. Methods Content validity was established by an expert panel consisting of ICU nurses, intensivists and five ICU patients. Concurrent validity, known-groups validity and internal consistency were determined in a consecutive sample of 56 awake and oriented ICU patients with a median age of 70 years (IQR: 57-74). Results Content validity of the TDS-HF in the ICU population was low, with item-content validity indexes between 0.25 and 0.75. Concurrent validity was high as Spearman's correlation between TDS-HF and the numeric rating score (0-10) for thirst distress was 0.71. Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha 0.78). When comparing groups, only higher blood urea nitrogen was significantly related to higher scores on the TDS-HF (P = .003). Conclusion The TDS-HF has high concurrent validity and reliability in measuring thirst distress in ICU patients. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the applicability and content validity of the scale, which should be further explored before the TDS-HF can be used in the ICU. Relevance for clinical practice The TDS-HF can be used to explore thirst distress and to evaluate interventions. Individual items of the scale can be used to explore the nature of thirst distress in individual patients.",0
663,"Hypothesis: Increased knowledge about motor subtypes of delirium may aid clinicians in the management of postoperative geriatric patients. Design: Prospective cohort study defining preoperative risk factors, outcomes, and adverse events related to motor subtypes of postoperative delirium. Setting: Referral medical center. Patients: Persons 50 years and older with planned postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission following an elective operation were recruited. Main Outcome Measures: Before surgery, a standardized frailty assessment was performed. After surgery, delirium and its motor subtypes were measured using the validated tools of the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Statistical analysis included the univariate t and chi(2) tests and analysis of variance with post hoc analysis. Results: Delirium occurred in 43.0% (74 of 172) of patients, representing 67.6% (50 of 74) hypoactive, 31.1% (23 of 74) mixed, and 1.4% (1 of 74) hyperactive motor subtypes. Compared with those having mixed delirium, patients having hypoactive delirium were older (mean [SD] age, 71 [9] vs 65 [9] years) and more anemic (mean [SD] hematocrit, 36% [8%] vs 41% [6%]) (P=.002 for both). Patients with hypoactive delirium had higher 6-month mortality (32.0% [16 of 50] vs 8.7% [2 of 23], P=.04). Delirium-related adverse events occurred in 24.3% (18 of 74) of patients with delirium; inadvertent tube or line removals occurred more frequently in the mixed group (P=. 006), and sacral skin breakdown was more common in the hypoactive group (P=. 002). Conclusions: Motor subtypes of delirium alert clinicians to differing prognosis and adverse event profiles in postoperative geriatric patients. Hypoactive delirium is the most common motor subtype and is associated with worse prognosis (6-month mortality, 1 in 3 patients). Knowledge of differing adverse event profiles can modify clinicians' management of older patients with postoperative delirium.",0
664,"With the emergence of intensive care in the 1950s and 1960s, delirium became more prominent. Doctors quickly set out to understand and prevent it, but delirium results from so many sources that decisive understanding remains elusive. Doctors have recognized delirium for centuries. Transient alterations in consciousness, attention, orientation, perception, or behavior were well known with malaria and alcohol withdrawal or after surgery. Delirium became more prominent in the 1950s and 1960s with the emergence of intensive care. Intensive care units (ICUs) made it possible for patients to survive more severe illnesses and for doctors to attempt more aggressive interventions that required physiological monitoring, respiratory support, and intensive nursing. Delirium, the `new madness of medical progress,'(1) became more prevalent and more visible. Doctors set out to understand and prevent it, but, as the Critical Care Medicine article ...",0
666,"Context: Critically-ill patients with hematologic malignancies are increasingly admitted to intensive care units globally. Unrelieved symptoms during intensive care treatment may contribute to poor outcomes. Objective: To better understand the symptom experience(s) for critically-ill patients with hematologic malignancies. Methods: A scoping review was conducted searching Medline, CINAHL, Pychlnfo, Embase, and ProQuest databases, the Cochrane Library, and the grey literature between January 1st, 1990 and July 15th, 2020. Two authors independently reviewed articles for inclusion and verified abstracted data. Results: Seventeen articles met inclusion criteria, including 11 cohort studies, 1 case-control study, and five review articles. No qualitative or mixed-method studies were retrieved. Symptoms were reported as the primary outcome across two studies (17%). Reported hematologic malignancy subtypes included leukemia and/or myelodysplastic syndrome (9, 53%), lymphoma (8, 47%), multiple myeloma (7, 41%), and aplastic anemia (2, 12%). The principal indication for ICU admission was respiratory failure, followed by cardiogenic shock/cardiac failure, endocrine disturbances, sepsis, and neurological failure. Only one study used validated tools for evaluating symptoms. Thirty-four symptoms were reported: altered level of consciousness/coma (35%); diarrhea (35%); nausea (35%); dyspnea (35%); vomiting (29%); and pain (29%). Two articles (13%) identified symptom clusters. Conclusion: There is minimal research that measures and explores the symptom experiences of critically-ill patients with hematologic malignancies. New research in this domain is needed to inform targeted symptom care for this vulnerable patient population.",0
667,"Purpose: Music as an intervention to mitigate pain and anxiety has been well studied in the perioperative period. We present a quality improvement (QI) report describing implementation and evaluation of a postoperative, inpatient personalized music program for older adults undergoing elective surgeries. Design: We embedded this program in an existing interdisciplinary perioperative care program, with an outpatient and an inpatient component, at an academic institution. Methods: We describe our initial QI steps, highlight critical lessons learned from this behavioral intervention, and discuss high yield areas to focus on future implementation efforts. Findings: Rapid cycle improvement was an effective method to monitor QI measures. Participants in our program perceived improved mood and pain control, were satisfied with their experience, and had lower rates of incident delirium. Conclusions: This program offers perioperative teams, especially frontline nursing staff, an inexpensive, patient-centered tool to optimize postoperative pain and anxiety. We believe that it can be easily replicated at a variety of hospital systems.",0
668,"Introduction: Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) suffer from sleep deprivation arising from nursing interventions and ambient noise. This may exacerbate confusion and ICU-related delirium. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that average hospital sound levels should not exceed 35 dB with a maximum of 40 dB overnight. We monitored five ICUs to check compliance with these guidelines. Methods: Sound levels were recorded in five adult ICUs in the UK. Two sound level monitors recorded concurrently for 24 hours at the ICU central stations and adjacent to patients. Sample values to determine levels generated by equipment and external noise were also recorded in an empty ICU side room. Results: Average sound levels always exceeded 45 dBA and for 50% of the time exceeded between 52 and 59 dBA in individual ICUs. There was diurnal variation with values decreasing after evening handovers to an overnight average minimum of 51 dBA at 4 AM. Peaks above 85 dBA occurred at all sites, up to 16 times per hour overnight and more frequently during the day. WHO guidelines on sound levels could be only achieved in a side room by switching all equipment off. Conclusion: All ICUs had sound levels greater than WHO recommendations, but the WHO recommended levels are so low they are not achievable in an ICU. Levels adjacent to patients are higher than those recorded at central stations. Unit-wide noise reduction programmes or mechanical means of isolating patients from ambient noise, such as earplugs, should be considered.",0
669,"The intensive care unit is a work environment where superior dedication is pivotal to optimize patients' outcomes. As this demanding commitment is multidisciplinary in nature, it requires special qualities of health care workers and organizations. Thus research in the field covers a broad spectrum of activities necessary to deliver cutting-edge care. However, given the abundance of research articles and education activities available, it is difficult for modern critical care clinicians to keep up with the latest progress and innovations in the field. This article broadly summarizes new developments in multidisciplinary intensive care, providing elementary information about advanced insights in the field by briefly describing selected articles bundled in specific topics. Issues considered include cardiovascular care, monitoring, mechanical ventilation, infection and sepsis, nutrition, education, patient safety, pain assessment and control, delirium, mental health, ethics, and outcomes research.",0
670,"Objectives: To evaluate functional outcomes and evaluate predictors of an unfavorable functional outcome in children following a critical illness. Design: Prospective observational longitudinal cohort study. Setting: Two tertiary care, Canadian PICUs: McMaster Children's Hospital and London Health Sciences. Patients: Children 12 months to 17 years old, admitted to PICU for at least 48 hours with one or more organ dysfunction, were eligible. Patients not expected to survive, direct transfers from neonatal ICU and patients in whom long-term follow-up would not be able to be conducted, were excluded. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The primary endpoint was functional outcome up to 6 months post PICU discharge, measured using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disabilities Inventory Computer Adaptive Test. Secondary outcomes included predictors of unfavorable functional outcome, caregiver stress, health-related quality-of-life, and clinical outcomes such as mortality, length of stay, and PICU-acquired complications. One hundred eighty-two patients were enrolled; 78 children (43.6%) had functional limitations at baseline and 143 (81.5%) experienced functional deterioration following critical illness. Ninety-two (67.1%) demonstrated some functional recovery by 6 months. Higher baseline function and a neurologic insult at PICU admission were the most significant predictors of functional deterioration. Higher baseline function and increasing age were associated with slower functional recovery. Different factors affect the domains of functioning differently. Preexisting comorbidities and iatrogenic PICU-acquired morbidities were associated with persistent requirement for caregiver support (responsibility function) at 6 months. The degree of functional deterioration after critical illness was a significant predictor of increased hospital length of stay. Conclusions: This study provides new information regarding functional outcomes and the factors that influence meaningful aspects of functioning in critically ill children. Identifying patients at greatest risk and modifiable targets for improvement in PICU care guides us in developing strategies to improve functional outcomes and tailor to the rehabilitation needs of these patients and their families.",0
671,"PurposeThe study aimed to explore factors associated with deep sedation practice in intensive care units (ICUs). Materials and MethodsA post hoc analysis was conducted for a cross-sectional survey on sedation practices in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients, combined with a questionnaire for physicians regarding their preferences for light sedation (P-pls Score) in 92 Chinese ICUs. ResultsThere were 457 and 127 eligible MV patients in the light and deep sedation groups respectively. A multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the control mode of mechanical ventilation, plasma lactate level, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were independent risk factors for deep sedation practice (p <0.01). Notably, the adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of the average P-pls score in the ICU <= 2 for deep sedation practice was 1.861 (1.163, 2.978, p = 0.01). In addition, the areas under curves of receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) of the model to predict the probability of deep sedation practice were 0.753 (0.699, 0.806) and 0.772 (0.64, 0.905) in the training set and the validation set, respectively. The 28-day mortality was increased in patients with exposure to deep sedation practice but not significantly. ConclusionBoth factors related to stressful stimuli and the ICU physicians' perception of patient tolerability in mechanical ventilation were likely associated with deep sedation practice in MV patients.",0
672,"Context Protocolized sedation and daily sedation interruption are 2 strategies to minimize sedation and reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Wehypothesized that combining these strategies would augment the benefits. Objective To compare protocolized sedation with protocolized sedation plus daily sedation interruption in critically ill patients. Design, Setting, and Patients Randomized controlled trial of 430 critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults conducted in 16 tertiary care medical and surgical ICUs in Canada and the United States between January 2008 and July 2011. Intervention Continuous opioid and/or benzodiazepine infusions and random allocation to protocolized sedation (n=209) (control) or to protocolized sedation plus daily sedation interruption (n=214). Using validated scales, nurses titrated infusions to achieve light sedation. For patients receiving daily interruption, nurses resumed infusions, if indicated, at half of previous doses. Patients were assessed for delirium and for readiness for unassisted breathing. Main Outcome Measure Time to successful extubation. Secondary outcomes included duration of stay, doses of sedatives and opioids, unintentional device removal, delirium, and nurse and respiratory therapist clinical workload (on a 10-point visual analog scale [VAS]). Results Median time to successful extubation was 7 days in both the interruption and control groups (median [IQR], 7 [4-13] vs 7 [3-12]; interruption group hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.86-1.35; P=.52). Duration of ICU stay (median [IQR], 10 [5-17] days vs 10 [6-20] days; P=.36) and hospital stay (median [IQR], 20 [10-36] days vs 20 [10-48] days; P=.42) did not differ between the daily interruption and control groups, respectively. Daily interruption was associated with higher mean daily doses of midazolam (102 mg/d vs 82 mg/d; P=.04) and fentanyl (median [IQR], 550 [50-1850] vs 260 [0-1400]; P<.001) and more daily boluses of benzodiazepines (mean, 0.253 vs 0.177; P=.007) and opiates (mean, 2.18 vs 1.79; P<.001). Unintentional endotracheal tube removal occurred in 10 of 214 (4.7%) vs 12 of 207 patients (5.8%) in the interruption and control groups, respectively (relative risk, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.36-1.84; P=.64). Rates of delirium were not significantly different between groups (53.3% vs 54.1%; relative risk, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.82-1.17; P=.83). Nurse workload was greater in the interruption group (VAS score, 4.22 vs 3.80; mean difference, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-0.66; P=.001). Conclusion For mechanically ventilated adults managed with protocolized sedation, the addition of daily sedation interruption did not reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU stay.",0
673,"Objective: To examine the causes of poor sleep in critically ill patients from nurses' experiences. Review methodology: A meta-synthesis following the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research statement was conducted. Articles were searched systematically in the CINAHL, MEDLINE and Embase databases up to January 2020. Study selection and data extraction were performed by two authors working independently. Included articles were critically evaluated by both authors using the Critical Appraisal Screening Programme tool. Findings: The meta-synthesis resulted in four analytical themes: (1) Inherent factors of critical illness, (2) Lack of implementation of evidence-based practice, (3) Lack of relational collaboration, (4) Hospital organisation and culture. Conclusion: This literature review indicates that promoting critically ill patients' sleep is difficult. Evidence-based interventions should be implemented into practice in order for nurses to be able to meet the patients' needs and improve sleep. Furthermore, the team surrounding the patient must have support from the health care organisation, and a culture change is necessary to improve communication between them to reach a shared goal to improve critically ill patients' sleep.

674,"Objective: To investigate the impact of multicomponent, nonpharmacologic interventions (MNI) on perioperative cortisol and melatonin levels, as well as postoperative delirium (PD), in elderly oral cancer patients. Methods: A total of 160 elderly oral cancer patients who underwent tumor resection surgery and completed our investigation were included in this study. The cancer patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: Group U or Group I. During the perioperative period, Group U received usual care, while Group I received MNI, which is based on usual care and aims to decrease the risk of PD. MNI focused on general geriatric approaches and supportive nursing care. On the day before surgery and the first three postoperative days, nocturnal (20:00-8:00) urine samples were collected. The melatonin sulfate and cortisol levels in the urine samples were determined. Moreover, the RASS (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale), CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit) and QoR40 (40-item quality of recovery score) scores were dynamically monitored. Results: There were no significant differences in the general characteristics between the 2 groups. After surgery, the melatonin sulfate levels in the nocturnal urine of Group I were higher than those in Group U. The cortisol concentrations were lower in Group I compared to those in Group U. Group I achieved better postoperative RASS and QoR40 scores than Group U. Compared to Group U, Group I also experienced less PD (incidence and duration). Conclusions: MNI ameliorated some postoperative disturbances regarding sleep and stress, decreased the incidence of PD and improved recovery quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

675,"Sedative medications are widely used in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Structured assessment of sedation and agitation is useful to titrate sedative medications and to evaluate agitated behavior, yet existing sedation scales have limitations. We measured interrater reliability and validity of a new 10-level (+4 ""combative"" to -5 ""unarousable"") scale, the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), in two phases. In phase 1, we demonstrated excellent (r = 0.956, lower 90% confidence limit = 0.948; K = 0.73, 95% confidence interval = 0.71, 0.75) inter-rater reliability among five investigators (two physicians, two nurses, and one pharmacist) in adult ICU patient encounters (n = 192). Robust inter-rater reliability (r = 0.922-0.983) (K = 0.64-0.82) was demonstrated for patients from medical, surgical, cardiac surgery, coronary, and neuroscience ICUs, patients with and without mechanical ventilation, and patients with and without sedative medications. In validity testing, RASS correlated highly (r = 0.93) with a visual analog scale anchored by ""combative"" and ""unresponsive,"" including all patient subgroups (r = 0.84-0.98). In the second phase, after implementation of RASS in our medical ICU, inter-rater reliability between a nurse educator and 27 RASS-trained bedside nurses in 101 patient encounters was high (r = 0.964, lower 90% confidence limit = 0.950; K = 0.80, 95% confidence interval = 0.69, 0.90) and very good for all subgroups (r = 0.773-0.970, kappa = 0.66-0.89). Correlations between RASS and the Ramsay sedation scale (r = -0.78) and the Sedation Agitation Scale (r = 0.78) confirmed validity. Our nurses described RASS as logical, easy to administer, and readily recalled. RASS has high reliability and validity in medical and surgical, ventilated and nonventilated, and sedated and nonsedated adult ICU patients.",0
676,"Intensive care unit survivors experience prolonged physical impairments, cognitive impairments, and mental health problems, commonly referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Previous studies reported the prevalence, assessment, and prevention of PICS, including the ABCDEF bundle approach. Although the management of PICS has been advanced, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) posed an additional challenge to PICS. The prevalence of PICS after COVID-19 extensively varied with 28-87% of cases pertaining to physical impairments, 20-57% pertaining to cognitive impairments, and 6-60% pertaining to mental health problems after 1-6 months after discharge. Each component of the ABCDEF bundle is not sufficiently provided from 16% to 52% owing to the highly transmissible nature of the virus. However, new data are emerging about analgesia, sedation, delirium care, nursing care, early mobilization, nutrition, and family support. In this review, we summarize the recent data on PICS and its new challenge in PICS after COVID-19 infection.",0
677,"Modern concepts for sedation and analgesia and guidelines recommend light analgesia and sedation, so that patients on mechanically ventilation are more awake, compared to previous concepts. Hence, these patients are more alert and able to experience their situation on the ventilator and their endotracheal tube (ETT). There is currently no convincing evidence of how patients tolerate the tube under present conditions, which interventions could help them, or whether they want to be sedated deeper because of the tube. Based upon our own observations, a broad range of reactions are possible. The tolerance of the ETT in intensive care patients was explored. A systematic literature research without time constraints in the databases PubMed and CINAHL was performed. Included were quantitative and qualitative studies written in German or English that investigated tolerance of the ETT in adult intensive care patients. Excluded were anesthetic studies including in- and extubation immediately before and after operations. Of the 2348 hits, 14 studies were included, including 4 qualitative studies about the experience of intensive care, 8 quantitative studies including 2 randomized controlled studies, and 2 studies with a mixed approach. Within the studies different aspects could be identified, which may in- or decrease the tolerance of an ETT. Aspects like breathlessness, pain during endotracheal suctioning and inability to speak decrease the tolerance. Information, the presence of relatives and early mobilization appear to increase the tolerance. Tolerance of the ETT is a complex phenomenon. A reflected and critical evaluation of the behavior of the patient with an ETT is recommended. Interventions that increase the tolerance of the ETT should be adapted to the situation of the patient and should be evaluated daily.",0
678,"Aim The purpose was to examine the effects of non-commercial music on quality of sleep and relaxation indices, including heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and respiratory rate in patients in intensive care units. Background There is currently insufficient scientific knowledge for the effects of music on quality of sleep in critically ill patients. Design A randomized controlled trial. Methods Between JanuaryDecember 2010, 28 patients aged 3978years were randomly assigned to music and control groups. Participants in the music groups listened to non-commercial music for 45minutes at nocturnal sleep time. In the control group, participants slept with no music. Participants were assessed using vital signs monitors, standardized questionnaire, and polysomnography. Polysomnography sleep was recorded for the first 2hours of the nocturnal sleep. General estimating equation was applied to analyse data. Findings Participants in the music group had shorter stage N2 sleep and longer stage N3 sleep in the first 2hours of the nocturnal sleep and improved self-reported sleep quality, compared with those in the control group. The music group patients also had significantly lower heart rates than those in the control group. The intensive care units patients experienced fragmented sleep with a high frequency of awakenings and severe reduction in random eye movement sleep during the first 2hours of the nocturnal sleep. Conclusion The findings provided evidence for nurses to use soothing music as a research-based nursing intervention for intensive care unit patients' sleep improvement.",0
680,"Aim The aim was to qualitatively and quantitatively clarify the stress experiences of patients who were mechanically ventilated in an intensive care unit (ICU) for more than 12 hr. Methods The participants were adult patients without cognitive impairment who were mechanically ventilated in a general ICU for more than 12 hr. The Japanese version of the ICU Stressful Experiences Questionnaire (ICU-SEQJ) survey was performed before subjects were discharged from the ICU to collect narratives about how they felt and what they thought during their ICU stay. The results were analyzed in a collective and complementary way by dividing ICU-SEQJ scores into quartiles and comparing the first (low stress experience group) and third quartiles (high stress experience group). Results A total of 96 subjects were enrolled in the study, with 25 scoring in the high stress experience group and 24 in the low stress experience group. The high stress experience group had significantly longer duration of intubation, higher amounts of analgesics and sedative drugs, higher C-reactive protein, lower level of deepest sedation and greater absence of medical history than the low stress experience group. Analysis of the subjects' narratives revealed ""Unbearable holistic discomfort"", ""Pain of being unable to control myself as before"" in the high stress experience group and ""Responding by giving meaning"" in the low stress experience group. Conclusions Nurses must recognize that long intubation hours and invasive procedures are subjective stress experiences that may cause patients to suffer holistic discomfort and lose their sense of control.",0
681,"Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of continuous infusion of haloperidol in treating agitated critically ill adult patients. Design: Case series of patients treated with continuous infusion of haloperidol and followed to hospital discharge, during a 6-month period. Setting: A 34-bed multidisciplinary intensive care unit (ICU) in a 598-bed nonuniversity, tertiary care teaching hospital. Patients: Consecutive sample of eight patients requiring mechanical ventilation who had severe agitation which was refractory to intermittent bolus treatment with benzodiazepines, narcotics, and haloperidol. Interventions: Continuous infusions of haloperidol (range 3 to 25 mg/hr) were supplemented, as required, to maintain adequate sedation. Measurements and Main Results: The four men and four women averaged 47 yrs of age, and the average length of hospitalization was 33 days, with 25 days spent in the ICU. On the day continuous infusion of haloperidol was initiated, the average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) scores were 24 and 47, respectively. The Sedation-Agitation Scale score averaged +2.4 (maximum agitation score being +3) before continuous infusion of haloperidol decreasing to +1.8 after 1 day (p = .38) and to +0.8 after 2 days (p = .06) of continuous infusion of haloperidol. The average daily haloperidol dose increased from 68 mg before continuous infusion of haloperidol to 269 mg (p < .008) after 1 day. The daily total of nonhaloperidol sedatives decreased from 18.3 to 10.9 sedation-equivalent units (p = .15) and the daily number of bolus administrations of sedatives decreased from 23 to 7 (p = .01) after 1 day of continuous infusion of haloperidol. Estimated nursing time to prepare, administer, and monitor these bolus medications decreased from 320 to 96 mins per 24 Fires (p = .01). Of the five patients discharged alive (37.5% mortality rate), four were successfully weaned from assisted ventilation during continuous infusion of haloperidol. Two of these four patients were difficult to wean because of agitation and oversedation. Four possible complications were noted: minor tremors (n = 2), atrial dysrhythmias with intermittent third-degree atrioventricular block and and QT interval prolongation (n = 1), and ventricular tachycardia (n = 1). Conclusions: Continuous infusion of haloperidol effectively controls severe agitation in critically ill patients, reduces requirements for bolus administration of sedatives and nursing time lost to that task, and may facilitate ventilator weaning. Parenteral administration of haloperidol was associated with few complications in >1,340 patient-hours of continuous administration.",0
682,"Acutely ill hospitalized older adults often experience a decline in function that may be preventable using a proactive, interdisciplinary, patient-centered approach. Hospitalists are treating an increasing number of these patients. A collaborative geriatrics consultation model to prevent functional decline and improve care for older patients with geriatrics syndromes was developed and implemented in partnership with a large hospitalist group in a community teaching hospital. A team of a geriatrician and a geriatrics nurse practitioner led the new consultation service. The team assisted with identifying cases, provided consultation early in the hospital stay, focused its evaluation on functional and psychosocial issues, and assisted in clinical management to optimize implementation of recommendations. In the first 4 years, the consultation service conducted 1,538 consultations in patients with a mean age of 81 (range 56-103). The most frequent geriatrics diagnoses were gait instability, delirium, and depression; recommendations usually included consulting physical therapy, increasing activity, and changing medications. The number of referrals and referring physicians grew steadily each year. Twenty-eight of 34 (82%) of the referring hospitalists completed a Web-based satisfaction questionnaire. All responding hospitalists agreed that proactive geriatrics consultation helped them provide better care; 96% rated the service as excellent. Analysis of hospital administrative data revealed a lower length of stay index and lower hospital costs in patients receiving a geriatrics consultation. The Proactive Geriatrics Consultation Service represents a promising model of collaboration between hospitalists and geriatricians for improving care of hospitalized older adults.",0
683,"Background Sleep deprivation among patients is a common problem in the intensive care unit (ICU). Studies have tried to find the etiologies of sleep deprivation. Poor sleep quality in the ICU has effects such as delirium, weakening the wound healing, and anxiety. Researches have concluded that the etiologies for sleep deprivation are multifactorial. Objectives The aim of this review is to discuss the etiologies of sleep deprivation among ICU patients. This review also aims to discuss effects of sleep deprivations and provide implications for promoting sleep quality in the ICU. Methods For this literature review, ProQuest, MEDLINE, and Up To Date were used to find articles about sleep deprivation among ICU patients. The search was narrowed to articles between 2008 and 2019. A total of 23 articles were included that were found to match the inclusion criteria. Results Findings indicated that sleep deprivations etiologies among ICU patients can be environmental and nonenvironmental. Sensory overload, sensory deprivation, and patients' care activities are environmental etiologies for sleep deprivation. The nonenvironmental factors include pharmacological, physical, and psychological factors. Discussion Sleep deprivation etiologies are multifactorial and have several effects on ICU patients. Sleep protocol and staff training should be introduced to reduce unnecessary interventions by ICU staff. Tele-ICU monitoring can also be introduced to reduce unnecessary interventions where clinicians can monitor patients remotely and therefore enhance sleep in the ICU. During their stay in the ICU, patients can be instructed to wear earplugs and also have aromatherapy massage to reduce stress and enhance sleep quality. More research on the physical pain and the psychological factors using objective methods should be conducted in the future.",0

685,"Background: Most studies on patients' experiences following emergency cardiac surgery focus on evaluation of patients after their discharge. Few studies have evaluated patients' experiences after being transferred from intensive care and before being discharged. Objective: This study aimed to describe patients' experiences in the early stages of recovery following emergency heart surgery. Methods: For this exploratory qualitative descriptive study, 13 patients were recruited from a medical centre in northern Taiwan. Participants had undergone emergency heart surgery and had resided in the cardiothoracic surgical ward for >= 6 days following transfer from the ICU; all expected to be discharged from the hospital within 3 days. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted in private after the patients had been transferred to the cardiothoracic surgical wards. Audiotaped interviews were transcribed and analysed using content analysis. Findings: Data analysis identified four themes, which represented different recovery stages: sudden and serious symptoms, nightmares and vivid dreams, physical and emotional disturbances, and establishing a new life after emergency surgery. A fifth theme, support for a new lifestyle, occurred between the four stages. Conclusion: Participants experienced symptoms of physical and psychological stress during the early recovery stages following emergency heart surgery. A lack of understanding of the process of recovery increased these difficulties; participants wanted and needed multidisciplinary care and education. Emergency heart surgery does not allow healthcare professionals to inform patients of what to expect post-surgery. Our findings suggest that rather than waiting until discharge to offer disease information and treatment plans, multidisciplinary care should be initiated as soon as possible to facilitate recovery.

686,"Survivors of critical illness often experience multiple morbidities that start in the intensive care unit and impact their quality of life after discharge. Reduced physical function, cognitive decline, feeding disorders, and psychological stress are just a few of the potential complications. Many of these morbidities can lead to a reduced quality of life and lifelong impediments. Early mobilization, an intervention that is intended to maintain or restore musculoskeletal strength in the critically ill, has the potential to also yield positive psychological and cognitive benefits. In adults, early mobilization has been shown to be safe, decrease the incidence of delirium, and decrease length of stay. Early mobilization of the pediatric critically ill patient is still a novel topic with a growing body of research. This article will review the current literature on early mobilization of the pediatric critically ill patient.",0
687,"Objectives: This study investigates the possibility of a relationship between oversedation and mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. The presence of burst suppression, a pattern of severely decreased brain wave activity on the electroencephalogram, may be unintentionally induced by heavy doses of sedatives. Burst suppression has never been studied as a potential risk factor for death in patents without a known neurologic disorder or injury. Design: Post hoc analysis of a prospectively observational cohort study. Setting: Medical intensive care units of a tertiary care, university-based medical center. Patients: A total of 125 mechanically ventilated, adult, critically ill patients. Measurements and Main Results: A validated arousal scale (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) was used to measure sedation level, and the bispectral index monitor was used to capture electroencephalogram data. Burst suppression occurred in 49 of 125 patients (39%). For analysis, the patients were divided into those with burst suppression (49 of 125, 39%) and those without burst suppression (76 of 125, 61%). All baseline variables were similar between the two groups, with the overall cohort demonstrating a high severity of illness (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores of 27.4 +/- 8.2) and 98% receiving sedation. Of those with burst suppression, 29 of 49 (59%) died within 6 months compared with 25 of 76 (33%) who did not demonstrate burst suppression. Using time-dependent Cox regression to adjust for clinically important covariates (age, Charlson comorbidity score, baseline dementia, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, coma, and delirium), patients who experienced burst suppression were found to have a statistically significant higher 6-month mortality [Hazard's ratio = 2.04, 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.70, p = 0.02]. Conclusion. The presence of burst suppression, which was unexpectedly high in this medical intensive care unit population, was an independent predictor of increased risk of death at 6 months. This association should be studied prospectively on a larger scale in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients. (Crit Care Med 2008; 36:3171-3177)",0
688,"Background Becoming critically ill represents not just a great upheaval for the patient in question, but also for the patient's closest family. In recent years, there has been a change in how the quality of the public health service is measured. There is currently a focus on how patients and their families perceive the quality of treatment and care. It can be challenging for patients to evaluate their stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) due to illness and treatment. Earlier studies show that the perceptions of the family and the patient may concur. It is important, therefore, to ascertain the family's level of satisfaction with the ICU stay. The aim of the study was to describe how the family evaluate their satisfaction with the ICU stay. A further aim was to identify which demographic variables were associated with differences in family satisfaction. Method The study had a cross-sectional design. A sample of 57 family members in two ICUs in Norway completed the questionnaire: Family satisfaction in the intensive care unit 24 (FS-ICU 24). Statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test (U), Kruskal Wallis, Spearman rho and a performance-importance plot. Results The results showed that families were very satisfied with a considerable portion of the ICU stay. Families were less satisfied with the information they received and the decision-making processes than with the nursing and care performed during the ICU stay. The results revealed that two demographic variables - relation to the patient and patient survival - significantly affected family satisfaction. Conclusion Although families were very satisfied with the ICU stay, several areas were identified as having potential for improvement. The results showed that some of the family demographic variables were significant for family satisfaction. The findings are clinically relevant since the results can strengthen intensive care nurses' knowledge when meeting the family of the intensive care patient.",0
689,"Nurses are the largest segment of the nation's health care workforce, which makes nurses vital to the translation of evidence-based practice as a practice norm. Critical care nurses are in a position to critically appraise and apply best evidence in daily practice to improve patients' outcomes. It is important for critical care nurses to continually evaluate their current practice to ensure that they are applying the current best evidence rather than practicing on the basis of tradition. This article is based on a presentation at the 2013 National Teaching Institute of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. Four practice interventions that are within the realm of nursing are critiqued on the basis of current best evidence: (1) turning critically ill patients, (2) sleep promotion in the intensive care unit, (3) feeding tube management in infants and children, and (4) prevention of venothromboembolism... again. The related beliefs, current evidence, and implications for practice associated with each topic are described.",0
690,"Understanding the perceptions of stakeholders is critical for determining acceptability and feasibility of volunteer-mediated programs. This study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability for staff, volunteers, patients and their carers, of a volunteer diversional therapy program for patients with cognitive impairment undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. Post-program structured interviews were conducted with the volunteers (n = 10), patients (n = 30) and their carers (n = 3); and nursing staff (n = 6) participated in a focus group. Thematic analysis identified five themes (values, attitudes, knowledge, purpose, support) in two dimensions (personal, team culture). Overall, patients, carers, staff and volunteers were satisfied with the volunteer program and perceived benefits for quality of care. Recommendations for improvements to the program related to staff engagement with the program and the volunteers' education and training. The volunteer diversional therapy pilot program for patients with cognitive impairment on a sub-acute ward was acceptable and feasible for patients, carers, staff and volunteers. (C) 2014 Mosby, Inc.

691,"Evidence-based nursing care is informed by research findings, clinical expertise, and patients' values, and its use can improve patients' outcomes. Use of research evidence in clinical practice is an expected standard of practice for nurses and health care organizations, but numerous barriers exist that create a gap between new knowledge and implementation of that knowledge to improve patient care. To help close that gap, the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses has developed many resources for clinicians, including practice alerts and a hierarchal rating system for levels of evidence. Using the levels of evidence, nurses can determine the strength of research studies, assess the findings, and evaluate the evidence for potential implementation into best practice.

693,"Background: There is a relationship between the application of physical restraints and negative physiological and psychological effects on critically ill patients. Many organizations have supported and advocated minimizing the use of physical restraints. However, it is still common practice in many countries to apply physical restraints to patients in intensive care. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of various non-pharmacological interventions used to minimize physical restraints in intensive care units and provide a supplement to the evidence summary for physical restraints guideline adaptation. Methods: Based on the methodology of umbrella review, electronic databases, including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Joanna Briggs Institute Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycInfo/Psyc Articles/Psychology and Behavioral Science Collection, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, SinoMed, and Wanfang Data, were searched to identify systematic reviews published from January 2016 to December 2020. Two independent reviewers undertook screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal. The methodological quality of systematic reviews was evaluated by AMSTAR 2. Evidence quality of each intervention was assessed according to GRADE. The corrected covered area was calculated as a measure of overlap. Results: A total of 47 systematic reviews were included in the umbrella review, of which six were evaluated as high quality, five were of moderate quality, and the rest were of low or critically low quality. The corrected covered area range was from 0.0 to 0.269, which indicated that there was mild overlap between systematic reviews. The included systematic reviews evaluated various types of non-pharmacological interventions for minimizing physical restraints in intensive care units, which included multicomponent interventions involving healthcare professionals' education, family engagement/support, specific consultations and communication, rehabilitation and mobilization (rehabilitation techniques, early mobilization, inspiratory muscle training), interventions related to reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation (weaning modes or protocols, ventilator bundle or cough augmentation techniques, early tracheostomy, high-flow nasal cannula), and management of specific symptoms (delirium, agitation, pain, and sleep disturbances). Conclusion: The number of systematic reviews related to physical restraints was limited. Multicomponent interventions involving healthcare professionals' education may be the most direct non-pharmacological intervention for minimizing physical restraints use in intensive care units. However, the quality of evidence was very low, and conclusions should be taken with caution. Policymakers should consider incorporating non-pharmacological interventions related to family engagement/support, specific consultations and communication, rehabilitation and mobilization, interventions related to reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation, and management of specific symptoms as part of the physical restraints minimization bundle. All the evidence contained in the umbrella review provides a supplement to the evidence summary for physical restraints guideline adaptation.",0
694,"Physical restraints continue to be used in acute care settings, despite the challenges and calls to reduce this practice. The current guideline on restraint use is updated with evidence that includes critical care settings and issues related to restraint use in acute care units. Nurses play a significant role in the use of restraints. Factors such as nurse's knowledge and patient characteristics combined with the culture and resources in health care facilities influence the practice of physical restraint use. Nurses can identify patients at high risk for restraint use; assess the potential causes of unsafe behaviors; and target interventions in the areas of physiological, psychological, and environmental approaches to address those unsafe behaviors. Members of the interdisciplinary team can provide additional consultation, and institutions can provide resources and education and implement monitoring processes and quality improvement practices to help reduce the practice of physical restraint use.",0
695,"We present areas of uncertainty concerning intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) and identify areas for future research. Age, pre-ICU functional and cognitive state, concurrent illness, frailty, and health trajectories impact outcomes and should be assessed to stratify patients. In the ICU, early assessment of limb and diaphragm muscle strength and function using nonvolitional tests may be useful, but comparison with established methods of global and specific muscle strength and physical function and determination of their reliability and normal values would be important to advance these techniques. Serial measurements of limb and respiratory muscle strength, and systematic screening for dysphagia, would be helpful to clarify if and how weakness of these muscle groups is independently associated with outcome. ICUAW, delirium, and sedatives and analgesics may interact with each other, amplifying the effects of each individual factor. Reduced mobility in patients with hypoactive delirium needs investigations into dysfunction of central and peripheral nervous system motor pathways. Interventional nutritional studies should include muscle mass, strength, and physical function as outcomes, and prioritize elucidation of mechanisms. At follow-up, ICU survivors may suffer from prolonged muscle weakness and wasting and other physical impairments, as well as fatigue without demonstrable weakness on examination. Further studies should evaluate the prevalence and severity of fatigue in ICU survivors and define its association with psychiatric disorders, pain, cognitive impairment, and axonal loss. Finally, methodological issues, including accounting for baseline status, handling of missing data, and inclusion of patient-centered outcome measures should be addressed in future studies.",0
696,"Background Older general hospital patients, particularly those with cognitive impairment, frequently experience adverse events and other care complications during their stay. As these findings have so far been based on small and selected patient samples, the aim of the present study was to provide reliable data on a) the prevalence of adverse care issues (summarized under the term care challenges) in older general hospital patients and on b) associated patient-related risk factors (e.g. cognitive impairment). Methods A cross-sectional representative study comprising 1469 patients aged >= 65 years from 33 randomly selected general hospitals in southern Germany (GHoSt). Data collection included the use of different data sources, e.g. structured interviews with responsible nursing staff concerning care challenges and procedures for determining the patients' cognitive status. Results Care challenges were statistically significantly (p< 0.001) more often reported for patients with dementia and/or delirium (87.5%) and mild cognitive impairment (47.9%) compared to cognitively unimpaired patients (24.6%). Adjusted odds ratios suggested cognitive impairment, impaired activities of daily living, receiving long-term care and unplanned admission as significant patient-related risk factors for care challenges. Furthermore, the occurrence of such issues was associated with the application of physical restraints, support from relatives, prescription of psycholeptics and specialist consultations. Conclusion The findings suggest a strong impact of different degrees of cognitive impairment on challenges in care. The results might help to design appropriate training programs for hospital staff and other interventions to prevent or reduce critical situations.",0
697,"Background Adults in intensive care units (ICUs) often suffer from a lack of sleep or frequent sleep disruptions. Non-pharmacological interventions can improve the duration and quality of sleep and decrease the risk of sleep disturbance, delirium, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the length of stay in the ICU. However, there is no clear evidence of the effectiveness and harms of different non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in adults admitted to the ICU. Objectives To assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in critically ill adults in the ICU. To establish whether non-pharmacological interventions are safe and clinically effective in improving sleep quality and reducing length of ICU stay in critically ill adults. To establish whether non-pharmacological interventions are cost effective. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (OVID, 1950 to June 2014), EMBASE (1966 to June 2014), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 1982 to June 2014), Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1956 to June 2014), CAM on PubMed (1966 to June 2014), Alt HealthWatch (1997 to June 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to June 2014), the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM-disc, 1979 to June 2014), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI Database, 1999 to June 2014). We also searched the following repositories and registries to June 2014: ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (www.clinicaltrials.gov), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (ISRCTN Register) (www. controlled-trials. com), the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (www.chictr.org.cn), the Clinical Trials Registry-India (www.ctri.nic.in), the Grey Literature Report from the New York Academy of Medicine Library (www.greylit.org), OpenGrey (www.opengrey.eu), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry platform (www.who.int/trialsearch). We handsearched critical care journals and reference lists and contacted relevant experts to identify relevant unpublished data. Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs that evaluated the effects of non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in critically ill adults (aged 18 years and older) during admission to critical care units or ICUs. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened the search results and assessed the risk of bias in selected trials. One author extracted the data and a second checked the data for accuracy and completeness. Where possible, we combined results inmeta-analyses using mean differences and standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. We used post-test scores in this review. Main results We included 30 trials, with a total of 1569 participants, in this review. We included trials of ventilator mode or type, earplugs or eye masks or both, massage, relaxation interventions, foot baths, music interventions, nursing interventions, valerian acupressure, aromatherapy, and sound masking. Outcomes included objective sleep outcomes, subjective sleep quality and quantity, risk of delirium, participant satisfaction, length of ICU stay, and adverse events. Clinical heterogeneity (e. g., participant population, outcomesmeasured) and research design limited quantitative synthesis, and only a small number of studies were available for most interventions. The quality of the evidence for an effect of non-pharmacological interventions on any of the outcomes examined was generally low or very low. Only three trials, all of earplugs or eye masks or both, provided data suitable for two separate meta-analyses. These meta-analyses, each of two studies, showed a lower incidence of delirium during ICU stay (risk ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.80, P value = 0.002, two studies, 177 participants) and a positive effect of earplugs or eye masks or both on total sleep time (mean difference 2.19 hours, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.96, P value = 0.02, two studies, 116 participants); we rated the quality of the evidence for both of these results as low. There was also some low quality evidence that music (350 participants; four studies) may improve subjective sleep quality and quantity, but we could not pool the data. Similarly, there was some evidence that relaxation techniques, foot massage, acupressure, nursing or social intervention, and sound masking can provide small improvements in various subjective measures of sleep quality and quantity, but the quality of the evidence was low. The effects of non-pharmacological interventions on objective sleep outcomes were inconsistent across 16 studies (we rated the quality of the evidence as very low): the majority of studies relating to the use of earplugs and eye masks found no benefit; results from six trials of ventilator modes suggested that certain ventilator settings might offer benefits over others, although the results of the individual trials did not always agree with each other. Only one study measured length of stay in the ICU and found no significant effect of earplugs plus eye masks. No studies examined the effect of any non-pharmacological intervention on mortality, risk of post-traumatic stress disorder, or cost-effectiveness; the included studies did not clearly report adverse effects, although there was very low quality evidence that ventilator mode influenced the incidence of central apnoeas and patient-ventilator asynchronies. Authors' conclusions The quality of existing evidence relating to the use of non-pharmacological interventions for promoting sleep in adults in the ICU was low or very low. We found some evidence that the use of earplugs or eye masks or both may have beneficial effects on sleep and the incidence of delirium in this population, although the quality of the evidence was low. Further high-quality research is needed to strengthen the evidence base.",0
698,"Objectives: With decreasing mortality in PICUs, a growing number of survivors experience long-lasting physical impairments. Early physical rehabilitation and mobilization during critical illness are safe and feasible, but little is known about the prevalence in PICUs. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of rehabilitation for critically ill children and associated barriers. Design: National 2-day point prevalence study. Setting: Eighty-two PICUs in 65 hospitals across the United States. Patients: All patients admitted to a participating PICU for greater than or equal to 72 hours on each point prevalence day. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was prevalence of physical therapy- or occupational therapy-provided mobility on the study days. PICUs also prospectively collected timing of initial rehabilitation team consultation, clinical and patient mobility data, potential mobility-associated safety events, and barriers to mobility. The point prevalence of physical therapy- or occupational therapy-provided mobility during 1,769 patient-days was 35% and associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio for 13-17 vs < 3 yr, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.5-3.1) and male gender (adjusted odds ratio for females, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61-0.95). Patients with higher baseline function (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category, <= 2 vs > 2) less often had rehabilitation consultation within the first 72 hours (27% vs 38%; p < 0.001). Patients were completely immobile on 19% of patient-days. A potential safety event occurred in only 4% of 4,700 mobility sessions, most commonly a transient change in vital signs. Out-of-bed mobility was negatively associated with the presence of an endotracheal tube (adjusted odds ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.1-0.2) and urinary catheter (adjusted odds ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.1-0.6). Positive associations included family presence in children less than 3 years old (adjusted odds ratio, 4.55; 95% CI, 3.1-6.6). Conclusions: Younger children, females, and patients with higher baseline function less commonly receive rehabilitation in U.S. PICUs, and early rehabilitation consultation is infrequent. These findings highlight the need for systematic design of rehabilitation interventions for all critically ill children at risk of functional impairments.",0
699,"Recently, dexmedetomidine has been marketed in Spain and other European countries. The published experience regarding its use has placed dexmedetomidine on current trends in sedo-analgesic strategies in the adult critically ill patient. Dexmedetomidihe has sedative and analgesic properties, without respiratory depressant effects, inducing a degree of depth of sedation in which the patient can open its eyes to verbal stimulation, obey simple commands and cooperate in nursing care. It is therefore a very useful drug in patients who can be maintained on mechanical ventilation with these levels of sedation avoiding the deleterious effects of over or infrasedation. Because of its effects on alpha 2-receptors, it's very useful for the control and prevention of tolerance and withdrawal to other sedatives and psychotropic drugs. The use of dexmedetomidine has been associated with lower incidence of delirium when compared with other sedatives. Moreover, it's a potentially useful drug for sedation of patients in non-invasive ventilation. 2013 Elsevier Espana, S.L. and SEMICYUC. All rights reserved.",0
700,"Background Targeted education to help parents and caregivers recognize the signs and symptoms of post-intensive care syndrome may increase their awareness and willingness to seek support during their child's admission.The optimal strategy for this education has not been established. Methods A pilot study to test 3 educational strategies for caregivers of pediatric intensive care unit patients. The 3 strategies were compared using the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model framework for effectiveness of the education, the effect of each educational intervention on the intensive care unit nursing environment, and costs. Nursing responses were scored on a 3-point Likert scale. Results A total of 62 caregivers randomly received 1 of 3 educational strategies: brochures (n=22), scripted conversation (n=20), or a 3-minute video (n=20). All 3 strategies were associated with a notable improvement in understanding of post-intensive care syndrome, with no single strategy being superior. Nineteen bedside nurses completed a survey on how daily workflow was affected and education was perceived.The survey indicated that all 3 interventions minimally disrupted workflow and all were recognized as useful. Final analysis indicated that brochures have the greatest likelihood of successful and sustainable implementation in the study hospital. Conclusion Simple, low-cost education can improve caregiver's knowledge of post-intensive care syndrome and can be well supported by nursing staff.To ensure sustainable implementation, the characteristics of the unit should be considered when selecting an educational program.",0
701,"Contrary to the ideal vision of death, in which we die at home, surrounded by loved ones and free from pain, most Americans die in hospitals, in pain and alone [1]. Although death may always be a sad event, there is a great deal that physicians can do to help patients achieve the kind of death they want. Because so many people die in hospitals, and many more are hospitalized in the last year of life, hospitalists and other hospital-based physicians have a unique opportunity to improve end-of-life care. Patients and their families are clear about what they want and need from the health care system at the end of life: freedom from distressing symptoms such as pain and dyspnea, the opportunity to communicate with physicians and others about death and dying, and the knowledge that they will be attended to and comforted by their physicians as they approach death [2]. These goals form the basis of comprehensive palliative care. Because the end of life is an especially trying time for patients and families, the discontinuity between inpatient and outpatient settings inherent in hospitalist systems provides special challenges. It is critical for the hospitalist and primary care physician (PCP) to communicate clearly about treatment and to create opportunities for the PCP to visit patients and provide input regarding their care [3].",0
702,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients usually require long periods of mechanical ventilation and sedation, which added to steroid therapy, favours a predisposition to the development of delirium and subsequent mental health disorders, as well as physical and respiratory sequelae. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) at 3 months after hospital discharge, in a cohort of mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). An ambispective, observational study was conducted in three hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) follow-up clinics. We studied adults who survived a critical illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. A physical (muscle strength and pulmonary function), functional [12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Barthel score], psychological [hospital anxiety and depression (HADS) and posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity scales], and cognitive [Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test] assessment were performed. A total of 186 patients were evaluated at 88 days (IQR 68-121) after hospital discharge. Mean age was 59 +/- 12 years old, 126 (68%) patients were men, and median length of mechanical ventilation was 14 days (IQR 8-31). About 3 out of 4 patients (n = 139, 75%) met PICS criteria. Symptoms of cognitive and psychiatric disorders were found in 59 (32%) and 58 (31%) patients, respectively. Ninety-one (49%) patients had muscle weakness. Pulmonary function tests in patients with no respiratory comorbidities showed a normal pattern in 93 (50%) patients, and a restrictive disorder in 62 (33%) patients. Also, 69 patients (37%) were on sick leave, while 32 (17%) had resumed work at the time of assessment. In conclusion, survivors of critical illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring mechanical ventilation have a high prevalence of PICS. Physical domain is the most frequently damaged, followed by cognitive and psychiatric disorders. ICU follow-up clinics enable the assistance of this vulnerable population.",0
703,"Introduction: Older people living with frailty and/or cognitive impairment who have coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience higher rates of critical illness. There are also people who become critically ill with COVID-19 for whom a decision is made to take a palliative approach to their care. The need for clinical guidance in these two populations resulted in the formation of the Care of Older People and Palliative Care Panel of the National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce in June 2020. This specialist panel consists of nursing, medical, pharmacy and allied health experts in geriatrics and palliative care from across Australia. Main recommendations: The panel was tasked with developing two clinical flow charts for the management of people with COVID-19 who are i) older and living with frailty and/or cognitive impairment, and ii) receiving palliative care for COVID-19 or other underlying illnesses. The flow charts focus on goals of care, communication, medication management, escalation of care, active disease-directed care, and managing symptoms such as delirium, anxiety, agitation, breathlessness or cough. The Taskforce also developed living guideline recommendations for the care of adults with COVID-19, including a commentary to discuss special considerations when caring for older people and those requiring palliative care. Changes in management as result of the guideline: The practice points in the flow charts emphasise quality clinical care, with a focus on addressing the most important challenges when caring for older individuals and people with COVID-19 requiring palliative care. The adult recommendations contain additional considerations for the care of older people and those requiring palliative care.",0

705,"Background: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients often experience pain, especially during diagnostic, nursing, and therapeutic interventions. Pain assessment using the Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) and Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CCPOT) are recommended, but they are difficult to do in patients undergoing deep sedation. This study analyzed the usefulness of the BPS and CCPOT scales in assessing pain among patients with varying degrees of sedation. Methods: In 81 mechanically ventilated and sedated ICU patients, 1005 measurements were performed using the BPS and CCPOT scales. The study was conducted by 3 trained observers 3 times a day (each measurement at rest, during painful nursing interventions, and after the intervention). The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) were also analyzed from medical records as well as information on the length of hospitalization and treatment. Results: It was shown that signs of pain increased significantly (p < 0.001) during interventions in patients on both scales (BPS and CCPOT), and then returned to values close to the resting period. RASS results correlated significantly (p < 0.05) and positively with the results of the BPS and CCPOT. A strong correlation was found between the results of both scales at each stage of the study (R = 0.622-0.907). Conclusions: Nursing procedures are a source of pain in analgosedated patients. The BPS and CCPOT scales are useful tools for assessing the occurrence of pain in mechanically ventilated patients, including those in deep sedation.",0
706,"Changing global demography is resulting in older people presenting to emergency departments (EDs) in greater numbers than ever before. They present with greater urgency and are more likely to be admitted to hospital or re-attend and utilize greater resources. They experience longer waits for care and are less likely to be satisfied with their experiences. Not only that, but older people suffer poorer health outcomes after ED attendance, with higher mortality rates and greater dependence in activities of daily living or rates of admission to nursing homes. Older people's assessment and management in the ED can be complex, time consuming, and require specialist skills. The interplay of multiple comorbidities and functional decline result in the complex state of frailty that can predispose to poor health outcomes and greater care needs. Older people with frailty may present to services in an atypical fashion requiring detailed, multidimensional, and increasingly multidisciplinary care to provide the correct diagnosis and management as well as appropriate placement for ongoing care or admission avoidance. Specific challenges such as delirium, functional decline, or carer strain need to be screened for and managed appropriately. Identifying patients with specific frailty syndromes can be critical to identifying those at highest risk of poor outcomes and most likely to benefit from further specialist interventions. Models of care are evolving that aim to deliver multidimensional assessment and management by multidisciplinary specialist care teams (comprehensive geriatric assessment). Increasingly, these models are demonstrating improved outcomes, including admission avoidance or reduced death and dependence. Delivering this in the ED is an evolving area of practice that adapts the principles of geriatric medicine for the urgent-care environment.",0
707,"We report a case of critical exercise-associated hyponatremia in an 85-year-old man, an experienced hiker, during an overnight trek through Yosemite National Park. His medical history was significant for mild renal insufficiency, diastolic dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension. He was taking a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), without a prior history of an electrolyte imbalance. The hiker drank a modest amount of fluid (3 liters) and urinated only once during the 9-hour descent, from a starting elevation of approximately 3000 meters, before the sudden onset of delirium occurred. He was subsequently airlifted to the nearest hospital. Initial blood sodium concentration ([Na+]) was 120 mEq/L, urine [Na+] was 21 mEq/L, plasma osmolality was 266 mOsm/kgH(2)O, and urine osmolality 364 mOsm/kgH(2)O. The patient did not respond to infusions of normal saline, but after an intravenous 20 mg bolus of furosemide, a copious diuresis ensued, after which he recovered fully. This case highlights the complexities of fluid and sodium homeostasis during prolonged hiking, as the combination of both environmental factors (extreme temperatures, altitude, and water and sodium availability) and individual factors (hypertension, age) may have all contributed to the development of life-threatening exercise-associated hyponatremia. This case is unique in that neither the water intoxication model nor the sodium depletion model can fully explain the pathophysiologic findings documented in this report.",0
708,"Background: Sleep disturbance is common among hospitalized patients. However, sleep promotion is not a high priority for most healthcare providers, which potentially impacts quality of care. Due to a paucity of validated tools to assess sleep promotion, little is known about the relationship between sleep promotion and quality of care. This study was conducted to assess the validity and reliability of a newly-developed instrument, the Sleep Promotion Questionnaire, and to examine sleep promotion as a predictor of quality of care. The Sleep Promotion Questionnaire includes dimensions of attitude, control, unit norms, intention, and behavior that are associated with sleep promotion. Methods: A total of 302 nurses participated in an online survey. The survey included the initial 36-item Sleep Promotion Questionnaire, a quality of care question, Caring Behavior Inventory, and Professional Quality of Life scale. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to determine the factor structure of the Sleep Promotion Questionnaire. The internal consistency reliability as well as the convergent and divergent validities was assessed. Pearson's correlations and hierarchical multiple regression procedures were performed to explore the predictors of perceived quality of care. Results: Exploratory factor analysis of the Sleep Promotion Questionnaire yielded 28 items in five subscales, comprising Attitude, Control, Unit Norms, Sleep-aid Intention, and Behavior. Convergent and divergent validities were supported (r=0.37; r=-0.38, respectively). The Cronbach's alphas of internal consistency reliabilities of the Sleep Promotion Questionnaire subscales ranged from 0.70 to 0.89. Regression models showed that sleep-promoting Unit Norms was the only significant predictor of perceived quality of care among both ICU and non-ICU nurses (=0.40; =0.28, respectively). Conclusion: The Sleep Promotion Questionnaire appears to be a reliable and valid instrument with satisfactory psychometric properties for assessing sleep promotion, and it seems that having unit norms conducive to sleep promotion may positively impact the quality of care.

709,"Background Despite the general belief that mobility and exercise play an important role in the recovery of functional status, mobility is difficult to implement in patients in intensive care units. Objectives To compare a mobility platform with standard equipment, assessing efficiency (decreased time and staff required to prepare patient), effectiveness (increased activity time), and safety (no falls, unplanned tube removals, or emergency situations) for intensive care patients. Methods This observational study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from the patient or the medical decision maker. Intensive care patients were assigned to a room in the usual manner, with platforms in odd-numbered rooms and standard equipment in even-numbered rooms. Standardized data collection tools were designed to collect data for 24 hours for each patient. The nurses caring for the patients completed the data collection tools in real time during the activity. The stages of activity and the physiological states that would preclude mobility were very specifically defined for the research study. Results Data were collected for a total of 71 patients and 238 activities. Important (although not significant) descriptive statistics regarding early mobility in the intensive care unit were discovered. The unintended result of the research study was a change in the culture and practice regarding early mobility in the intensive care unit. Conclusions Early mobility can be implemented in intensive care units. Standard equipment can be used to mobilize such patients safely; however, for patients who ambulate, a platform may increase efficiency and effectiveness.",0
710,"Mechanical ventilation is a common life-support intervention for critically ill patients that can cause stressful psychological symptoms. Animal-assisted interactions have been used in a variety of inpatient settings to reduce symptom burden and promote overall well-being. Because of the severity of illness associated with critical care, use of highly technological equipment, and heightened concern for infection control and patient safety, animal-assisted interaction has not been widely adopted in the intensive care unit. This case study of the therapeutic interaction between a canine and a mechanically ventilated patient provides support for the promotion of animal-assisted interactions as an innovative symptom management strategy in the intensive care unit.",0
711,"Delirium, an acute confusional state, is a common occurrence in Intensive Care Units (ICI's). Patients who develop delirium have globally worse outcomes than those who do not and thus the diagnosis of delirium is of importance. Current diagnostic methods have several limitations leading to the suggestion of eye-tracking for its diagnosis through in-attention. To ascertain the requirements for an eye-tracking system in an adult ICII, measurements were carried out at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Clinical criteria guided empirical requirements of invasiveness and calibration methods while accuracy and precision were measured. A non-invasive system was then developed utilising a patient-facing RGB camera and a scene-facing RGBD camera. The system's performance was measured in a replicated laboratory environment with healthy volunteers revealing an accuracy and precision that outperforms what is required while simultaneously being non-invasive and calibration-free The system was then deployed as part of CONfuSED, a clinical feasibility study where we report aggregated data from 5 patients as well as the acceptability of the system to bedside nursing staff. To the best of our knowledge, the system is the first eye-tracking systems to be deployed in an ICU for delirium monitoring.",0
712,"Background. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a gaze-controlled communication system (eye tracker, ET) can improve communication processes between completely dysarthric ICU patients and the hospital staff, in three main domains: 1) basic communication processes (i.e., fundamental needs, desire, and wishes); 2) the ability of the medical staff to understand the clinical condition of the patient; and 3) the level of frustration experienced by patient, nurses and physicians. Methods. Fifteen fully conscious medical and surgical patients, 8 physicians, and 15 nurses were included in the study. The experimental procedure was composed by three phases: in phase 1 all groups completed the preintervention questionnaire; in phase 2 the ET was introduced and tested as a communication device; in phase 3 all groups completed the postintervention questionnaire. Results. Patients preintervention questionnaires showed remarkable communication deficits, without any group effect. Answers of physicians and nurses were pretty much similar to the one of patients. Postintervention questionnaires showed in all groups a remarkable and statistically significant improvement in different communication domains, as well as a remarkable decrease of anxiety and disphoric thought. Improvement was also reported by physicians and nurses in their ability to understand patient's clinical conditions. Conclusion. Our results show an improvement in the quality of the examined parameters. Better communication processes seem also to lead to improvements in several psychological parameters, namely anxiety and drop-out depression perceived by both patients and medical staff. Further controlled studies are needed to define the ET role in ICU. (Minerva Anestesiol 2013;79:165-75)",0
713,"This study aimed to explore healthcare providers' experiences of their communication and interaction with conscious patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care. Nurses, physicians, and physiotherapists were interviewed after they had been video recorded in naturally occurring interactions with patients. The interviews were analyzed using a phenomenological-hermeneutical approach. Three themes were identified: The willingness to engage and understand the mechanically ventilated patient, the potential risk of neglecting the patient in the encounters, and provider interdependence as the core of intensive care. The themes elicited how providers handled the dissonance between their own personal ideals of care and their real-world encounters with patients and other professionals. The healthcare providers were aware of how easily patients could be neglected while being non-vocal, and therefore invested time and effort communicating with the patients. Based on their personal ideals of patient participation and autonomy, it was difficult to perform procedures, such as weaning off the ventilator or mobilization, to which the patient was opposed. Interprofessional collaboration was valued by the providers in such situations. The study revealed that providers need to consider the communication barriers that exist on the individual and team levels when interacting with patients on mechanical ventilation.",0
714,"Background: The effectiveness of physical restraints (PRs) in the prevention of unplanned extubation has been increasingly questioned, and several countries have developed clinical practice guidelines for reducing the use of PRs. However, some countries, including China, have failed to establish their guidelines, and the adaptation of existing guidelines to local circumstances may be an attractive alternative. Methods: Following the guideline definition of Institute of Medicine, the guideline will be adapted following the CAN-IMPLEMENT (c). Guideline scope and clinical questions will be established based on an integrative review, retrospective study, and stakeholder interviews. The guideline's quality will be assessed by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II and Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation-Recommendations Excellence. A systematic review and meta-analysis will be evaluated by A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews. The guidelines will meet the criteria of the RIGHT-Ad@ pt Checklist. Discussion: This study describes the proposed protocol for adapting clinical practice guidelines on PRs in critically ill patients. We believe the guideline will help health professionals, especially critical care nurses, deliver safe, high-quality patient care by reducing the implementation of PRs in China.",0
715,"The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis study was to estimate the pooled prevalence of burnout among health care workers (HCWs), who worked in health centers during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Questionnaire. A comprehensive search based on specific terms was performed through the online studies of Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest, until January 2022. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tool. Data analysis was carried out through the random-effects model, and the heterogeneity was investigated by I-2 statistic using the software STATA Version 16. In total, seven articles with 5,022 participants were included in the final analysis. Four studies with 4,419 participants reported the prevalence of burnout as percent in moderate and severe types for all three components of burnout syndrome. Our results showed that the 45% of pooled moderate and 37% of severe levels of emotional exhaustion, 49% of pooled moderate and 18% of severe levels of depersonalization, 38% of pooled moderate and 51% of pooled severe levels of reduced personal accomplishment. Whereas six studies with 4,838 sample size reported the mean prevalence of MBI-based burnout syndrome and the mean pooled prevalence of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and accomplishment was 21.57, 7.47, and 33.48, respectively. Based on our findings, HCWs who worked in health centers during COVID-19 outbreak, experienced significant burnout. Therefore, it is necessary to design and implement programs to deal with burnout among this populations. Public Significance Statement What is the public health significance of this article? This study suggests that health care workers (HCWs) who worked in health centers during the outbreak of COVID-19 and were in direct and/or indirect contact with COVID-19 patients experienced significant burnout. Burnout among HCWs is an important issue because it not only has an impact on their quality of life, but it can potentially affect the quality of care provided, increase medical errors, reduce patient safety, and even the influence on the mental health of their families and society. Therefore, it is necessary to design and implement programs to deal with burnout among this populations.",0
716,"Older patients often experience a loss of independent physical functioning during the course of an acute illness that requires hospitalization. Although functional outcomes are not usually the focus of care in the hospital, they may be critical determinants of the quality of life, physical independence, cost of care, and prognosis among older patients. Based on a conceptual model of the dysfunctional syndrome (functional decline associated with hospitalization) we developed, implemented and evaluated a multi-component intervention termed Acute Care for Elders (ACE), in hospital medical units of two urban hospitals. ACE is a model of care that combines the principles of geriatric assessment and quality improvement. The ACE intervention includes a prepared environment (environmental modification), patient-centered care (interdisciplinary assessment), interdisciplinary team rounds and planning for home, and medical care review. Results of randomized clinical trials support the effectiveness of ACE to improve outcomes of hospitalization for older patients. Improved functional status, lower risk of nursing home placement and higher levels of patient and professional satisfaction with care are achievable with ACE. The challenges of establishing an ACE unit in community hospitals can be met through a systematic process of implementation and evaluation. randomizedACE is a multi-component intervention that is potentially transportable to other hospital units, with benefits for patients, health professionals and hospital administrators.",0

Pediatric patients experience similar complications from inactivity as adults, such as hospital-acquired conditions and delirium. Interdisciplinary collaboration is imperative to improve functional and developmental outcomes of children who suffers from either a chronic illnesses or an acute illness that results in a prolonged hospitalization. Pediatric nursing assessments should include gross motor function related to mobility. Activities to mobilize pediatric patients should be based on age and developmental assessment. The purpose of this article is to describe the modification of an adult mobility assessment for the pediatric population.",0
718,"Context gamma- Aminobutyric acid receptor agonist medications are the most commonly used sedatives for intensive care unit ( ICU) patients, yet preliminary evidence indicates that the alpha(2) agonist dexmedetomidine may have distinct advantages. Objective To compare the efficacy and safety of prolonged sedation with dexmedetomidine vs midazolam for mechanically ventilated patients. Design, Setting, and Patients Prospective, double- blind, randomized trial conducted in 68 centers in 5 countries between March 2005 and August 2007 among 375 medical/ surgical ICU patients with expected mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. Sedation level and delirium were assessed using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale ( RASS) and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. Interventions Dexmedetomidine ( 0.2- 1.4 mu g/ kg per hour [ n= 244]) or midazolam ( 0.02- 0.1 mg/ kg per hour [ n= 122]) titrated to achieve light sedation ( RASS scores between - 2 and + 1) from enrollment until extubation or 30 days. Main Outcome Measures Percentage of time within target RASS range. Secondary end points included prevalence and duration of delirium, use of fentanyl and open-label midazolam, and nursing assessments. Additional outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and adverse events. Results There was no difference in percentage of time within the target RASS range ( 77.3% for dexmedetomidine group vs 75.1% for midazolam group; difference, 2.2% [ 95% confidence interval {CI}, - 3.2% to 7.5%]; P=. 18). The prevalence of delirium during treatment was 54% ( n= 132/ 244) in dexmedetomidine-treated patients vs 76.6% ( n= 93/ 122) in midazolam- treated patients ( difference, 22.6% [ 95% CI, 14% to 33%]; P <. 001). Median time to extubation was 1.9 days shorter in dexmedetomidine- treated patients ( 3.7 days [ 95% CI, 3.1 to 4.0] vs 5.6 days [ 95% CI, 4.6 to 5.9]; P=. 01), and ICU length of stay was similar ( 5.9 days [ 95% CI, 5.7 to 7.0] vs 7.6 days [ 95% CI, 6.7 to 8.6]; P=. 24). Dexmedetomidine-treated patients were more likely to develop bradycardia ( 42.2% [ 103/ 244] vs 18.9% [ 23/ 122]; P <. 001), with a nonsignificant increase in the proportion requiring treatment ( 4.9% [ 12/ 244] vs 0.8% [ 1/ 122]; P=. 07), but had a lower likelihood of tachycardia ( 25.4% [ 62/ 244] vs 44.3% [ 54/ 122]; P <. 001) or hypertension requiring treatment ( 18.9% [ 46/ 244] vs 29.5% [ 36/ 122]; P=. 02). Conclusions There was no difference between dexmedetomidine and midazolam in time at targeted sedation level in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. At comparable sedation levels, dexmedetomidine- treated patients spent less time on the ventilator, experienced less delirium, and developed less tachycardia and hypertension. The most notable adverse effect of dexmedetomidine was bradycardia. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00216190.",0
719,"Background Healthy sleep is an important component of childhood development. Changes in sleep architecture, including sleep stage composition, quantity, and quality from infancy to adolescence are a reflection of neurologic maturation. Hospital admission for acute illness introduces modifiable risk factors for sleep disruption that may negatively affect active brain development during a period of illness and recovery. Thus, it is important to examine non-pharmacologic interventions for sleep promotion in the pediatric inpatient setting. Objectives To evaluate the effect of non-pharmacological sleep promotion interventions in hospitalized children and adolescents on sleep quality and sleep duration, child or parent satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, delirium incidence, length of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and mortality. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, three other databases, and three trials registers to December 2021. We searched Google Scholar, and two websites, handsearched conference abstracts, and checked reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs, including cross-over trials, investigating the effects of any non-pharmacological sleep promotion intervention on the sleep quality or sleep duration (or both) of children aged 1 month to 18 years in the pediatric inpatient setting (intensive care unit [ICU] or general ward setting). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, evaluated risk of bias, extracted and synthesized data, and used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of evidence. The primary outcomes were changes in both objective and subjective validated measures of sleep in children; secondary outcomes were child and parent satisfaction, cost-effectiveness ratios, delirium incidence or delirium-free days at time of hospital discharge, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Main results We included 10 trials (528 participants; aged 3 to 22 years) in inpatient pediatric settings. Seven studies were conducted in the USA, two in Canada, and one in Brazil. Eight studies were funded by government, charity, or foundation grants. Two provided no information on funding. Eight studies investigated behavioral interventions (massage, touch therapy, and bedtime stories); two investigated physical activity interventions. Duration and timing of interventions varied widely. All studies were at high risk of performance bias due to the nature of the intervention, as participants, parents, and staff could not be masked to group assignment. We were unable to perform a quantitative synthesis due to substantial clinical heterogeneity. Behavioral interventions versus usual care Five studies (145 participants) provided low-certainty evidence of no clear difference between multicomponent relaxation interventions and usual care on objective sleep measures. Overall, evidence from single studies found no clear differences in daytime or nighttime sleep measures (33 participants); any sleep parameter (48 participants); or daytime or nighttime sleep or nighttime arousals (20 participants). One study (34 participants) reported no effect of massage on nighttime sleep, sleep efficiency (SE), wake after sleep onset (WASO), or total sleep time (TST) in adolescents with cancer. Evidence from a cross-over study in 10 children with burns suggested touch therapy may increase TST (391 minutes, interquartile range [IQR] 251 to 467 versus 331 minutes, IQR 268 to 373; P = 0.02); SE (76, IQR 53 to 90 versus 66, IQR 55 to 78; P = 0.04); and the number of rapid eye movement (REM) periods (4.5, IQR 2 to 5 versus 3.5, IQR 2 to 4; P = 0.03); but not WASO, sleep latency (SL), total duration of REM, or per cent of slow wave sleep. Four studies (232 participants) provided very low-certainty evidence on subjective measures of sleep. Evidence from single studies found that sleep efficiency may increase, and the percentage of nighttime wakefulness may decrease more over a five-day period following a massage than usual care (72 participants). One study (48 participants) reported an improvement in Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire scores after discharge in children who received a multicomponent relaxation intervention compared to usual care. In another study, mean sleep duration per sleep episode was longer (23 minutes versus 15 minutes), and time to fall asleep was shorter (22 minutes versus 27 minutes) following a bedtime story versus no story (18 participants); and children listening to a parent-recorded story had longer SL than when a parent was present (mean 57.5 versus 43.5 minutes); both groups reported longer SL than groups who had a stranger-recorded story, and those who had no story and absent parents (94 participants; P < 0.001). In one study (34 participants), 87% (13/15) of participants felt they slept better following massage, with most parents (92%; 11/12) reporting they wanted their child to receive a massage again. Another study (20 participants) reported that parents thought the music, touch, and reading components of the intervention were acceptable, feasible, and had positive effects on their children (very low-certainty evidence). Physical activity interventions versus usual care One study (29 participants) found that an enhanced physical activity intervention may result in little or no improvement in TST or SE compared to usual care (low-certainty evidence). Another study (139 participants), comparing play versus no play found inconsistent results on subjective measures of sleep across different ages (TST was 49% higher for the no play groups in 4- to 7-year olds, 10% higher in 7- to 11-year olds, and 22% higher in 11- to 14-year olds). This study also found inconsistent results between boys and girls (girls in the first two age groups in the play group slept more than the no play group). No study evaluated child or parent satisfaction for behavioral interventions, or cost-effectiveness, delirium incidence or delirium-free days at hospital discharge, length of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, or mortality for either behavioral or physical activity intervention. Authors' conclusions The included studies were heterogeneous, so we could not quantitatively synthesize the results. Our narrative summary found inconsistent, low to very low-certainty evidence. Therefore, we are unable to determine how non-pharmacologic sleep promotion interventions affect sleep quality or sleep duration compared with usual care or other interventions. The evidence base should be strengthened through design and conduct of randomized trials, which use validated and highly reliable sleep assessment tools, including objective measures, such as polysomnography and actigraphy.",0
720,"Purpose: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is an evidence-based perioperative measure to improve outcomes. Although the benefits of ERAS are well proven for other surgeries, little is known about its effect on off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCABG) surgery. Thus, this study aimed to explore the effect of an ERAS protocol in patients who underwent OPCABG surgery. Methods: This quasi-experimental study included 94 participants (traditional care group = 47 vs ERAS group = 47). An ERAS protocol was established by a multidisciplinary team. Knowledge of coronary artery disease, fasting time, water deprivation time, extubation time of the tracheal tube and pericardial and mediastinal drainage tube, off-bed activity participation rate, length of hospital stay, hours of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, expenses in ICU, incidence rates of ICU delirium and postoperative nausea and vomiting, and the 6-Minute Walk Test on postoperative day 7 were recorded and calculated between the groups. Results: Demographics, lifestyle, and disease severity showed no significant difference between the two groups (p > .05). The ERAS group patients had improved understanding of coronary artery disease (t = -3.89, p < .01), shorter fasting time (t = 7.98, p < .01), shorter water deprivation time (t = 9.29, p < .01), increased off-bed activity participation (t = 17.67, p < .01), and the improved 6-Minute Walk Test on postoperative day 7 (t = -3.23, p < .01). Conclusions: The ERAS protocol is safe and effective for patients undergoing OPCABG surgery. (C) 2020 Korean Society of Nursing Science. Published by Elsevier BV.",0
721,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact on sleep quality of a nursing-driven sleep hygiene protocol (SHP) instituted in a single burn-trauma intensive care unit. Criteria for eligibility were adult patients admitted to the Burn Service who were not delirious, able to respond verbally, and had not received general anesthesia in the prior 24 hours. Patients were surveyed using the validated Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire prior to implementation (""PRE""; May to December 2010) and following implementation (""POST""; January to August 2011) of a SHP that sought to minimize environmental stimuli and limit disruptions during the night. This analysis includes only initial survey responses from each patient. A total of 130 patients were surveyed, 81 PRE and 49 POST; 60% were burn admissions. There was no significant difference in responses to the questionnaire between burn and nonburn patients. All patients in the POST group were significantly older and more frequently endorsed taking sleep medication at home. Although not significant, POST patients reported falling asleep somewhat more quickly, but no other differences were identified between the two groups. Among patients who reported having sleep difficulties prior to admission, POST patients not only reported a significantly higher pain score than PRE patients, but also reported significant improvement in falling asleep and being able to go back to sleep. Frequency of complaints of sleep disruption was unchanged between PRE and POST patients. POST patients did complain significantly less than PRE patients about sleep disruptions by clinicians. Implementation of the SHP permitted acutely injured or ill patients in our intensive care unit to fall asleep more quickly and to experience fewer sleep disruptions. A sleep protocol may be helpful in improving sleep and overall well-being of burn center patients. (J Burn Care Res 2013;34:249-254)",0
722,"OBJECTIVE To describe the communication ability, methods, and content among nonspeaking nonsurviving patients treated with mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit. METHODS Fifty patients who received mechanical ventilation and died during hospitalization were randomly selected from all adult patients (N = 396) treated in 8 ICUs in a tertiary medical center during a 12-month period. Clinicians' notes, use of physical restraints, and medication records were reviewed retrospectively. Data on communication method, use of sedation/analgesia (within 4 hours of communication event), and use of physical restraints were recorded on an investigator-developed communication event record for the first 10 communication episodes documented in each patients record (n = 275). Message content and method were recorded for every documented communication episode (n = 694), resulting in a total of 812 content and 771 method data codes. RESULTS Most charts (72%) had documentation of communication by patients at some time during mechanical ventilation. Most documented communication exchanges were, between patients and nurses. Primary methods of communication were head nods, mouthing words, gesture, and writing. Physical restraints were used in half of the patients. However most of the documented communication episodes (127/202, 62.9%) occurred when physical restraints were not in use. Communication content was primarily related to pain, symptoms, feelings, and physical needs, Patients also initiated communication about their homes, families, and conditions. CONCLUSIONS A clinically significant proportion of nonsurviving patients treated with mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit communicate to nurses, other clinicians, and family members primarily through gesture, head nods, and mouthing words.",0
723,"In 2019, the American Psychiatric Association Council on Consultation-Liaison (C-L) Psychiatry convened a work group to develop a resource document on proactive C-L psychiatry. A draft of this document was reviewed by the Council in July 2020, and a revised version was approved by this Council in September 2020. The accepted version was subsequently reviewed by the American Psychiatric Association Council on Health Care Systems and Financing in November 2020. The final version was approved by the Joint Reference Committee on November 24, 2020, and received approval for publication by the Board of Trustees on December 12, 2020. This resource document describes the historical context and modern trends that have given rise to the model of proactive C-L psychiatry. Styled as an inpatient corollary to outpatient collaborative care models, proactive C-L provides a framework of mental health care delivery in the general hospital designed to enhance mental health services to a broad range of patients. Its 4 elements include systematic screening for active mental health concerns, proactive interventions tailored to individual patients, team-based care delivery, and care integration with primary teams and services. Studies have found that proactive C-L psychiatry is associated with reduced hospital length of stay, enhanced psychiatric service utilization, reduced time to psychiatric consultation, and improved provider and nurse satisfaction. These favorable results encourage further studies that replicate and build upon these findings. Additional outcomes such as patient experience, health outcomes, and readmission rates deserve investigation. Further studies are also needed to examine a broader array of team compositions and the potential value of proactive C-L psychiatry to different hospital settings such as community hospitals, surgery, and critical care.",0
724,"Introduction: Post-sepsis cognitive impairment is one of the major sequelae observed in survivors of sepsis. This cognitive impairment can be global or may affect specific domains. A better understanding of these deficits and associated risk factors could influence the care of patients with sepsis. Objective: To perform a systematic review to investigate the presence of cognitive impairment and its associated risk factors among patients who survived sepsis. Methods: The search was conducted in MEDLINE (1966 to March 2017) and EMBASE (1988 to March 2017). We included studies with individuals who were 18 years or older with post-sepsis cognitive impairment. Results: We analysed 577 articles. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. More than 74,000,000 patients were evaluated in the selected studies. Significant variation was observed in the definition of sepsis and cognitive impairment. Twelve studies used ACCP/SCCM criteria for sepsis, while cognitive impairment was defined per test used. Post-sepsis cognitive impairment was observed in 12.5 to 21% of survivors of sepsis. Attention, cognitive flexibility, processing speed, associative learning, visual perception, work memory, verbal memory, and semantic memory were the specific domains affected. Depressive symptoms, central nervous system infection, length of hospitalisation due to infection, and temporal proximity to the last period of infection were associated with cognitive impairment. Conclusion: The studies are heterogeneous, and there is urgent need for a common language, including definitions and neuropsychological tests, for the investigation of post-sepsis cognitive impairment. Despite this, there is mounting evidence for the clinical relevance of post-sepsis cognitive impairment. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42017054583 (www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO).

725,"Background: Modern methods in intensive care medicine often enable the survival of older critically ill patients. The short-term outcomes for patients treated in intensive care units (ICUs), such as survival to hospital discharge, are well documented. However, relatively little is known about subsequent long-term outcomes. Pain, anxiety and agitation are important stress factors for many critically ill patients. There are very few studies concerned with pain, anxiety and agitation and the consequences in older critically ill patients. The overall aim of this study is to identify how an ICU stay influences an older person's experiences later in life. More specific, this study has the following objectives: (1) to explore the relationship between pain, anxiety and agitation during ICU stays and experiences of the same symptoms in later life; and (2) to explore the associations between pain, anxiety and agitation experienced during ICU stays and their effect on subsequent health-related quality of life, use of the health care system (readmissions, doctor visits, rehabilitation, medication use), living situation, and survival after discharge and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Methods/Design: A prospective, longitudinal study will be used for this study. A total of 150 older critically ill patients in the ICU will participate (ICU group). Pain, anxiety, agitation, morbidity, mortality, use of the health care system, and health-related quality of life will be measured at 3 intervals after a baseline assessment. Baseline measurements will be taken 48 hours after ICU admission and one week thereafter. Follow-up measurements will take place 6 months and 12 months after discharge from the ICU. To be able to interpret trends in scores on outcome variables in the ICU group, a comparison group of 150 participants, matched by age and gender, recruited from the Swiss population, will be interviewed at the same intervals as the ICU group. Discussion: Little research has focused on long term consequences after ICU admission in older critically ill patients. The present study is specifically focussing on long term consequences of stress factors experienced during ICU admission.",0
726,"OBJECTIVES: To examine key factors that influence sustainability in the diffusion of the Hospital Elder Life Program ( HELP) as an example of an evidence-based, multifaceted, innovative program to improve care for hospitalized older adults. DESIGN: Longitudinal, qualitative study between November 2000 and November 2003 based on 102 in-depth interviews every 6 months during HELP implementation. SETTING: Thirteen hospitals implementing HELP. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two hospital staff members ( physician, nursing, volunteer, and administrative staff) implementing HELP, conducted 102 interviews. MEASUREMENTS: Staff experiences sustaining the program, including challenges and strategies that they viewed as successful in addressing these challenges. RESULTS: Of the 13 hospitals studied, 10 were sustaining HELP at the end of the study period; three terminated the program (after 24 months, 12 months, and 6 months). Critical factors were identified as influencing whether the program was sustained: the presence of clinical leadership, the ability and willingness to adapt the original HELP protocols to local hospital circumstances and constraints, and the ability to obtain longer-term resources and funding for HELP. CONCLUSION: Recognizing the need for sustained clinical leadership and funding as well as the inevitable modifications required to sustain innovative programs can promote more-realistic goals and expectations for health services researchers, clinicians, and policy makers in their laudable efforts to translate research into practice.",0
727,"Objective: To evaluate medication boxed warning nonadherence in the inpatient setting. Methods: This was a prospective cohort quality improvement project approved by our institution's Total Quality Council. General medicine and ICU patients 18 years and older were included if they were cared for by a prescriber-led multidisciplinary team that included a pharmacist. Patients were evaluated for medication orders with an actionable boxed warning; if boxed warning nonadherence occurred, the physician's reason was determined. Patients with boxed warning nonadherence were monitored for adverse drug reactions until discharge. Results: A total of 393 patients (224 general medicine and 169 ICU) were evaluated for nonadherence to 149 actionable boxed warnings. There were 293 drugs (175 general medicine and 118 ICU) with boxed warnings prescribed, and more than 50% of these were medications restarted from home. A total of 23 boxed warning nonadherences occurred in general medicine patients, and NSAIDs accounted for 81% of these events. ICU patients experienced 11 boxed warning nonadherences, with nearly 54% from anti-infectives and immunosuppressants. Antipsychotics were the most commonly ordered boxed warning medication class in ICU patients. Reasons for nonadherence included knowledge deficit and an acceptable risk-to-benefit ratio. Two adverse drug reactions occurred from boxed warning nonadherences, both because of a drug-drug interaction. Conclusions: Boxed warning nonadherence is a concern in the inpatient setting, specifically with NSAID use in general medicine patients and antipsychotic use in ICU patients. More than half of boxed warning nonadherence occurred in medications restarted from home, which emphasizes the need for medication evaluation during transitions of care.",0
728,"Background and purpose: Use of physical restraints is a common clinical practice in different conditions and hospital wards including Intensive Care Units (ICU). Given the importance of the use of physical restraints in the ICUs, the present systematic review was conducted in order to determine the prevalence of physical restraint use in the ICUs. Materials and methods: Related papers on restraint use in the ICUs published from 2000 to 2016 were included in this study by searching the national and international scientific databases. Based on Farsi and English keywords searching, and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, final 22 papers from 17 countries were selected for the meta-analysis. The data were analyzed by using Stata Software Version 12.0. The index of heterogeneity among different studies was determined using Cochran (Q) and I2 tests. Results: The present systematic review study includes 22 related articles. The prevalence of physical restrains use varied from 7% in the study by Elliott with a sample size of 569 patients in general ICUs in Australia to 87% in Curry's study with a sample of 26 patients in a surgical ICU in the United States. According to the results of the meta-analysis, the prevalence of physical restrains use was estimated to be 46.7% (CI 95%: 34.7-58.6) in the ICUs. Conclusion: As there is a widespread use of physical restraints in the ICU, it is necessary that hospital managers plan appropriately to reduce the use of physical restraints and whereby its complications and to increase adequately the knowledge, attitudes of ICU nurses towards physical restraint of patients and its affecting factors so that they adhere to the guidelines of this method of care properly.",0
729,"Background: Disrupted sleep is a critical and highly prevalent concern among critically ill patients requiring intensive care. However, the question of which nonpharmacological intervention represents the best strategy for improving sleep quality remains unanswered.Objective: To compare the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions in improving sleep quality in people who are critically ill.Methods: Databases, namely PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses A&I, were searched from their inception up until January 15, 2021, for relevant randomised controlled trials. No language or time period restrictions were applied. Only randomised controlled trials examining the effects of nonpharmacological interventions on sleep among adults (aged >= 18 years) admitted to an intensive care unit were included. A random-effects model was used for data analyses. The study protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42021232004).Results: Twenty randomised controlled trials involving 1,207 participants were included. Music combined with earplugs and eye masks (standardised mean difference = 1.64), eye masks alone (0.98), aromatherapy (0.87), and earplugs combined with eye masks (0.61) significantly improved sleep quality compared with routine care (all p < 0.05). Music combined with earplugs and eye masks significantly enhanced sleep quality in comparison with music (1.34), earplugs combined with eye masks (1.03), and nursing intervention (1.76, all p < 0.05). Earplugs alone was less likely to have effects on sleep quality improvement compared with routine care.Conclusion: Eye masks alone and music combined with earplugs and eye masks appear to be the most effective interventions for improving sleep quality in people who are critically ill. Critical care nurses should incorporate the use of eye masks alone or music combined with eye masks into sleep care.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
730,"Introduction Sleep is a state of quiescence that facilitates the significant restorative processes that enhance individuals' physiological and psychological well-being. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) experience substantial sleep disturbance. Despite the biological importance of sleep, sleep monitoring does not form part of standard clinical care for critically ill patients. There exists an unmet need to assess the feasibility and accuracy of a range of sleep assessment techniques that have the potential to allow widespread implementation of sleep monitoring in the ICU. Key measures The coprimary outcome measures of this study are to: determine the accuracy and feasibility of motion accelerometer monitoring (ie, actigraphy) and subjective assessments of sleep (nursing-based observations and patient self-reports) to the gold standard of sleep monitoring (ie, polysomnography) in evaluating sleep continuity and disturbance. The secondary outcome measures of the study will include: (1) the association between sleep disturbance and environmental factors (eg, noise, light and clinical interactions) and (2) to describe the sleep architecture of intensive care patients. Methods and analysis A prospective, single centre observational design with a within subjects' assessment of sleep monitoring techniques. The sample will comprise 80 adults (aged 18 years or more) inclusive of ventilated and non-ventilated patients, admitted to a tertiary ICU with a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score between +2 (agitated) and -3 (moderate sedation) and an anticipated length of stay >24 hours. Patients' sleep quality, total sleep time and sleep fragmentations will be continuously monitored for 24 hours using polysomnography and actigraphy. Behavioural assessments (nursing observations) and patients' self-reports of sleep quality will be assessed during the 24-hour period using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, subjective sleepiness evaluated via the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, along with a prehospital discharge survey regarding patients' perception of sleep quality and disturbing factors using the Little Sleep Questionnaire will be undertaken. Associations between sleep disturbance, noise and light levels, and the frequency of clinical interactions will also be investigated. Sound and luminance levels will be recorded at 1 s epochs via Extech SDL600 and SDL400 monitoring devices. Clinical interactions will be logged via the electronic patient record system Metavision which documents patient monitoring and clinical care. Ethics and dissemination The relevant institutions have approved the study protocol and consent procedures. The findings of the study will contribute to the understanding of sleep disturbance, and the ability to implement sleep monitoring methods within ICUs. Understanding the contribution of a clinical environment on sleep disturbance may provide insight into the need to address clinical environmental issues that may positively influence patient outcomes, and could dispel notions that the environment is a primary factor in sleep disturbance. The research findings will be disseminated via presentations at national and international conferences, proceedings and published articles in peer-reviewed journals.",0
732,"Urinary incontinence (UI) is now recognized as a prevalent, physically and emotionally disruptive, and costly health problem in the geriatric population. Because incontinence may be a manifestation of a subacute or reversible process within or outside of the lower urinary tract, and because effective treatment is available, it is important for primary care physicians to identify and appropriately assess incontinence in their geriatric patients. The initial evaluation of an incontinent geriatric patient includes a targeted history and physical examination, urinalysis, and simple tests of lower urinary tract function. Potentially reversible conditions that may be causing or contributing to the incontinence, such as delirium and urinary tract infection (UTI), should bc identified and managed. Patients who may benefit from further testing, including urologic or gynecologic examination and/or complex urodynamic tests, should be identified and referred. Several therapeutic modalities can be used to treat geriatric UI. Behavioral therapies are noninvasive and effective, both in functional community-dwelling geriatric patients and in functionally impaired nursing home residents. Behavioral therapies include bladder training, pelvic muscle exercises, biofeedback, scheduled toileting, habit training, and prompted voiding. Pharmacologic therapy is often used in conjunction with behavioral therapy. For stress incontinence, alpha-adrenergic drugs are used and can be combined with topical or oral estrogen therapy in women. For urge incontinence, pharmacologic treatment involves drugs with anticholinergic and direct bladder muscle relaxant properties. Pharmacologic therapy for overflow incontinence is generally not effective on a long-term basis. Surgical treatment is indicated when a pathologic lesion such as a tumor is diagnosed, or when anatomic obstruction is believed to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. Surgical treatment of stress incontinence can be highly effective in properly selected women. Nonspecific, supportive treatments are also important in managing geriatric UI. Education for patients and caregivers is critical for the success of most therapies. Environmental manipulations and the appropriate use of toilet substitutes are especially important in frail, functionally impaired patients. Highly absorbent adult undergarments are helpful for managing many patients, but should not be used as the initial response to incontinence, and are best used in conjunction with more specific treatment whenever possible. Chronic indwelling catheterization should only be used to manage incontinence when it is associated with clinically significant urinary retention, skin conditions that cannot heal because of incontinence, or severe illness that makes the catheter the most comfortable method of management. Research is ongoing to develop newer and more effective technologies and strategies to manage this prevalent and costly health problem.",0
733,"Introduction The post-anaesthetic phase is most often uncomplicated, but patients may experience inadequate emergence (IE) characterized by unrest, restlessness, aggressiveness or in contrast sedation or lack of initiative. This may increase length of stay (LOS) and post-operative complications. The aim of this study was to investigate frequency, risk factors and consequences of IE. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study including 1000 orthopaedic and abdominal surgical patients, screened with the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) before induction of anaesthesia, at arrival at the post-operative care unit, and just before discharge from PACU. IE was defined as a Nu-DESC score >= 2 after surgery. Predictors included surgical procedure, type and duration of anaesthesia, age, ASA-score, sex and post-operative pain. Data were analysed during adjusted logistic regression and Wilcoxon rank sum test, the primary outcome being LOS. Results IE occurred in 103 of 1000 patients (10.3%, 95% CI 8.6-12.3%). LOS was median 2 vs 1 day in patients with and without IE, mean difference was 1.3 (SD 6.2) days (P = 0.036). Thirty-day mortality was 2.9 vs 1.0% (P = 0.92) and admission to ICU 1.0 vs 0.9% (P = 0.66) in patients with and without IE. Significant associations to IE were found for inhalational anaesthetics (OR 2.65; 95% CI: 1.57-4.46), duration of anaesthesia >= 2 hours (OR 1.98; 95% CI: 1.14-3.44) and ASA-score >= 3 (OR 2.74; 95% CI: 1.64-4.57). Conclusion One of 10 patients had IE as defined by the Nu-DESC score, which was significantly associated with increased LOS. Longer duration of anaesthesia, inhalational anaesthesia and ASA >= 3 were significantly associated to this.",0
734,"Objective: To determine the safety and feasibility of an early mobilization program in a PICU. Design: Observational, pre-post design. Setting: PICU in a tertiary academic hospital in the United States. Patients: Critically ill pediatric patients admitted to the PICU. Intervention: This quality improvement project involved a usual-care baseline phase, followed by a quality improvement phase that implemented a multicomponent, interdisciplinary, and tiered activity plan to promote early mobilization of critically ill children. Measurements and Main Results: Data were collected and analyzed from July to August 2014 (preimplementation phase) and July to August 2015 (postimplementation). The study sample included 200 children 1 day through 17 years old who were admitted to the PICU and had a length of stay of at least 3 days. PICU Up! implementation led to an increase in occupational therapy consultations (44% vs 59%; p = 0.034) and physical therapy consultations (54% vs 66%; p = 0.08) by PICU day 3. The median number of mobilizations per patient by PICU day 3 increased from 3 to 6 (p < 0.001). More children engaged in mobilization activities after the PICU Up! intervention by PICU day 3, including active bed positioning (p < 0.001), and ambulation (p = 0.04). No adverse events occurred as a result of early mobilization activities. The most commonly reported barriers to early mobilization after PICU Up! implementation was availability of appropriate equipment. The program was positively received by PICU staff. Conclusions: Implementation of a structured and stratified early mobilization program in the PICU was feasible and resulted in no adverse events. PICU Up! increased physical therapy and occupational therapy involvement in the children's care and increased early mobilization activities, including ambulation. A bundled intervention to create a healing environment in the PICU with structured activity may have benefits for short-and long-term outcomes of critically ill children.",0
735,"Facilitating students' knowledge and ability to care for critically ill older adults is a daunting task for even the most experienced teacher. Faculty, preceptors, and mentors must address the seemingly dichotomous objectives of training practitioners capable of providing safe, technologically advanced care intended to restore hemodynamic stability tempered by the simultaneous goal of providing person-centered, culturally competent, age-appropriate interventions. This article provides specific approaches to prepare baccalaureate nursing students for some of the challenges experienced when caring for critically ill older adults, including teaching strategies, clinical competency behaviors/activities, and postconference topics. By creating a safe environment for asking questions, sharing their expertise and experiences, and adequately addressing individual learning styles, teachers can begin to instill the passion, commitment, and knowledge needed to care for this vulnerable population.",0
736,"Background: Sedation is crucial for the recovery of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Maintaining comfort and safety promotes optimal care for critically ill patients. Purpose: To examine sedation assessment and management undertaken by health professionals for mechanically ventilated patients in one Australian ICU. Methods: A retrospective clinical audit was undertaken of medical records of all eligible, mechanically ventilated patients admitted to an ICU of an Australian metropolitan, teaching hospital over a 12-month period. A Sedation Audit Tool was used to collect data from the day of intubation to 5 days after intubation. Findings: Data were extracted from medical records of 150 patients. The Riker Sedation Agitation Scale (SAS) was the scoring system used. Patients were unarousable or very sedated between 57% and 81% at some point during the study period, while between 5% and 11% were agitated, very agitated or extremely agitated across this time. Patients' sedation scores were not documented in between 3.3% and 23.3% of patients. Medications commonly used were propofol, midazolam, morphine, and fentanyl. There were 135 situations of adverse events, which related to patients pulling endotracheal tubes leading to malpositioning, patients biting endotracheal tubes causing desaturation, patient experiencing excessive agitation requiring restraint use, patients experiencing increased intracranial pressure above desired limits, patients self-extubating, and patients experiencing over-drowsiness leading to delays in extubation. Conclusions: Many patients were either very sedated or agitated at some point during the study period, and some patients experienced adverse outcomes associated with sedation practices. The findings inform future quality initiatives to improve sedation practices. (C) 2015 Australian College of Nursing Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0
737,"Background Individuals with dementia do not always have a diagnosis of dementia noted on their hospital claims. Whether this lack of documentation is associated with patient outcomes is unknown. We examined the association between a dementia diagnosis listed on a hospital claim and patient outcomes among individuals with a Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using administrative claims data and nursing home MDS assessments. Hospitalized patients aged 66 and older with advanced dementia noted on an MDS assessment completed within 120 days prior to their first hospitalization in 2017 were included. Advanced dementia was defined based on an MDS diagnosis of dementia, dependency in four or more activities of daily living, and a Cognitive Function Scale score indicative of moderate to severe impairment. Multilevel regression with a random intercept at the hospital level was used to examine the relationship between documentation of dementia in inpatient hospital Medicare claims and the following patient outcomes after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics: invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use, intensive care unit or coronary care unit (ICU/CCU) use, 30-day mortality, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Results In 2017, among 120,989 patients with advanced dementia and a nursing home stay, 90.57% had a dementia diagnosis on their hospital claims. In adjusted models, documentation of a dementia diagnosis was associated with lower use of the ICU/CCU (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.78 [95% confidence interval 0.74, 0.81]), use of IMV (AOR: 0.50 [0.47, 0.54]), and 30-day mortality (AOR: 0.81 [0.77, 0.85]). Patients with a dementia diagnosis had a shorter LOS. Conclusions Among patients with advanced dementia, those whose dementia diagnosis was documented on their inpatient hospital Medicare claim experienced lower use of ICU/CCU, use of IMV, lower 30-day mortality, and shorter LOS than those whose diagnosis was not documented.",0
738,"Background Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) experience sleep deprivation caused by environmental disruption, such as high noise levels and 24-hour lighting, as well as increased patient care activities and invasive monitoring as part of their care. Sleep deprivation affects physical and psychological health, and patients perceive the quality of their sleep to be poor whilst in the ICU. Artificial lighting during night-time hours in the ICU may contribute to reduced production of melatonin in critically ill patients. Melatonin is known to have a direct effect on the circadian rhythm, and it appears to reset a natural rhythm, thus promoting sleep. Objectives To assess whether the quantity and quality of sleep may be improved by administration of melatonin to adults in the intensive care unit. To assess whether melatonin given for sleep promotion improves both physical and psychological patient outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2017), Embase (1974 to September 2017), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to September 2017), and PsycINFO (1806 to September 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. Selection criteria We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials with adult participants (over the age of 16) admitted to the ICU with any diagnoses given melatonin versus a comparator to promote overnight sleep. We included participants who were mechanically ventilated and those who were not mechanically ventilated. We planned to include studies that compared the use of melatonin, given at an appropriate clinical dose with the intention of promoting night-time sleep, against no agent; or against another agent administered specifically to promote sleep. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE. Main results We included four studies with 151 randomized participants. Two studies included participants who were mechanically ventilated, one study included a mix of ventilated and non-ventilated participants and in one study participants were being weaned from mechanical ventilation. Three studies reported admission diagnoses, which varied: these included sepsis, pneumonia and cardiac or cardiorespiratory arrest. All studies compared melatonin against no agent; three were placebo-controlled trials; and one compared melatonin with usual care. All studies administered melatonin in the evening. All studies reported adequate methods for randomization and placebo-controlled trials were blinded at the participant and personnel level. We noted high risk of attrition bias in one study and were unclear about potential bias introduced in two studies with differences between participants at baseline. It was not appropriate to combine data owing to differences in measurement tools, or methods used to report data. The effects of melatonin on subjectively rated quantity and quality of sleep are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Three studies (139 participants) reported quantity and quality of sleep as measured through reports of participants or familymembers or by personnel assessments. Study authors in one study reported no difference in sleep efficiency index scores between groups for participant assessment (using Richards-Campbell SleepQuestionnaire) and nurse assessment. Two studies reported no difference in duration of sleep observed by nurses. The effects of melatonin on objectively measured quantity and quality of sleep are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (37 participants) reported quantity and quality of sleep as measured by polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, bispectral index (BIS) or electroencephalogram (EEG). Study authors in one study reported no difference in sleep efficiency index scores between groups using BIS and actigraphy. These authors also reported longer sleep in participants given melatonin which was not statistically significant, and improved sleep (described as "" better sleep"") in participants given melatonin from analysis of area under the curve (AUC) of BIS data. One study used PSG but authors were unable to report data because of a large loss of participant data. One study (82 participants) reported no evidence of a difference in anxiety scores (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (94 participants) reported data for mortality: one study reported that overall one-third of participants died; and one study reported no evidence of difference between groups in hospital mortality (very low certainty). One study (82 participants) reported no evidence of a difference in length of ICU stay (very low certainty evidence). Effects of melatonin on adverse events were reported in two studies (107 participants), and are uncertain (very low certainty evidence): one study reported headache in one participant given melatonin, and one study reported excessive sleepiness in one participant given melatonin and two events in the control group (skin reaction in one participant, and excessive sleepiness in another participant). The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was limited by sparse data with few participants. We noted study limitations in some studies due to high attrition and differences between groups in baseline data; and doses of melatonin varied between studies. Methods used to measure data were not consistent for outcomes, and use of some measurement tools may not be effective for use on the ICU patient. All studies included participants in the ICU but we noted differences in ICU protocols, and one included study used a nonstandard sedation protocol with participants which introduced indirectness to the evidence. Aut hors' conclusions We found insufficient evidence to determine whether administration of melatonin would improve the quality and quantity of sleep in ICU patients. We identified sparse data, and noted differences in study methodology, in ICU sedation protocols, and in methods used to measure and report sleep. We identified five ongoing studies from database and clinical trial register searches. Inclusion of data from these studies in future review updates would provide more certainty for the review outcomes.",0
739,"This paper reviews the literature related to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Syndrome. The intention of the paper is to explore the range of psychotic and affective phenomena that may be observed in practice, together with the management of contributory stressors. Patients experience a range of psycho-affective disturbances that may be triggered by drugs, the environment, dehumanizing practices and sleep deprivation. Symptoms do not always disappear following discharge and further research is required to determine the long-term psychological effects of an ICU. Comprehensive assessment of the patient's psychological state, using an appropriate tool, is necessary and should form an integral part of ongoing care. Interventions identified include eradication of dehumanizing behaviour, modification of environmental stimuli, effective communication and therapeutic touch. Where possible, communication needs should be addressed prior to admission, and patients and their families prepared for the unfamiliar world of the ICU.",0
740,"BACKGROUND: Even low-risk, elderly patients are at increased risk for postoperative morbidity compared with their younger counterparts. We sought to evaluate the role of a scoring model in predicting adverse surgical outcomes in low-risk, older, female cancer patients. STUDY DESIGN: From October 2011 to May 2014, two hundred and eighty-one low-risk female patients (aged 65 years and older, American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1 or 2) undergoing curative cancer surgery were included. The Multidimensional Frailty Score (MFS) was calculated by comprehensive geriatric assessment. The primary end point was postoperative complication (eg, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, delirium, acute pulmonary thromboembolism, and unplanned ICU admission). Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and institutionalization. RESULTS: Twenty patients experienced postoperative complications and 15 patients were discharged to nursing facilities. The fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) per 1-point increase in MFS was 1.412 (95% CI, 1.012-1.969; p = 0.042) for postoperative complications, 1.377 (95% CI, 0.935-2.026; p = 0.105) for institutionalization, and 1.411 (95% CI, 1.110-1.793; p = 0.005) for prolonged hospital stay. The high-risk group (MFS >= 7) showed an increased risk for postoperative complications (OR = 8.513; 95% CI, 2.210-32.785; p = 0.002), institutionalization (OR = 1.291; 95% CI, 0.324-5.152; p = 0.717), and prolonged hospital stay (OR = 2.336; 95% CI, 1.090-5.006; p = 0.029) compared with the low-risk group (MFS <7), after adjusting confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Multidimensional Frailty Score based on a preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment is useful for predicting postoperative complications and prolonged hospital stay, even in low-risk elderly women who are undergoing cancer surgery.

741,"Background: Many intensive care unit (ICU) patients describe noise as stressful and precluding sleep. No previous study in the adult setting has investigated whether room size impacts sound levels or the frequency of disruptive sounds. Methods: A-frequency S-time weighted equivalent continuous sound (L(AS)eq), A-frequency S-time weighted maximum sound level (L(AS)max) and decibel C peak sound pressure (L(C)peak) were measured during five 24-h periods in each of the following settings: three-bed room with nursing station (NS) alcove, single-bed room with NS alcove (1-BR with NSA) and single-bed room with bedside NS. Cumulative restorative time (CRT) (>5min with L(AS)max <55dB and L(C)peak <75dB) was calculated to describe calm periods. Two 8-h bedside observations were performed in each setting in order to note the frequency and sources of disruptive sounds. Results: Mean sound pressure levels (L(AS)eq) ranged between 52 and 58dBA, being lowest during night shifts. There were no statistically significant differences between the room types in mean sound levels or in CRT. However, disruptive sounds were 40% less frequent in the 1-BR with NSA than in the other settings. Sixty-four percent of disruptive sounds were caused by monitor alarms and conversations not related to patient care. Conclusions: Single-bed rooms do not guarantee lower sound levels per se but may imply less frequent disruptive sounds. Sixty-four percent of disruptive sounds were avoidable. Our findings warrant sound reducing strategies for ICU patients.",0
742,"Background/Aims: COVID-19 is a global pandemic, which has seen over 198 million cases as of August 2021. This case study highlights the rehabilitation of a young patient with respiratory and neurologic sequalae of COVID-19 across the continuum of care, from the intensive care unit to the inpatient rehabilitation unit. Case description: A 45-year-old woman, with past medical history of fibromyalgia and morbid obesity, presented with complaints of shortness of breath. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, was transferred to the intensive care unit, and was intubated for 17 days. The day after extubation, she experienced worsened mental status; computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed bilateral strokes. On hospital day 21, she was transferred to the stroke step-down unit. On hospital day 24, she recovered some cognitive ability and movement of her lower extremities. On hospital day 30, she was admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation unit. Examination by occupational and physiotherapists found motor and sensory impairments of multiple peripheral nerves, including musculocutaneous, axillary and radial nerves. Interventions included passive range of motion, sitting balance, transfer training, rigid taping, upper extremity strengthening and functional training (gait, stair, activities of daily living). Her activities of daily living performance was limited by upper extremity weakness, sensory loss and pain. Conclusions This case highlights the medical, neurological and functional implications of COVID-19 on patients after prolonged hospitalisation. The plan of care was informed by collaboration between rehabilitation disciplines. Causes of her injuries are unclear but could include positioning, brachial plexus injuries, or post-critical illness syndrome. Further research on the evaluation and care of patients with COVID-19 that result in profound neurological impairments is warranted.",0
743,"Background People in the intensive care unit (ICU) experience sleep deprivation caused by environmental disruption, such as high noise levels and 24-hour lighting, as well as increased patient care activities and invasive monitoring as part of their care. Sleep deprivation affects physical and psychological health, and people perceive the quality of their sleep to be poor whilst in the ICU. Propofol is an anaesthetic agent which can be used in the ICU to maintain patient sedation and some studies suggest it may be a suitable agent to replicate normal sleep. Objectives To assess whether the quantity and quality of sleep may be improved by administration of propofol to adults in the ICU and to assess whether propofol given for sleep promotion improves both physical and psychological patient outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2017), Embase (1974 to October 2017), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to October 2017) and PsycINFO (1806 to October 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. Selection criteria We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials with adults, over the age of 16 years, admitted to the ICU with any diagnoses, given propofol versus a comparator to promote overnight sleep. We included participants who were and were not mechanically ventilated. We included studies that compared the use of propofol, given at an appropriate clinical dose with the intention of promoting night-time sleep, against: no agent; propofol at a different rate or dose; or another agent, administered specifically to promote sleep. We included only studies in which propofol was given during 'normal' sleeping hours (i.e. between 10 pm and 7 am) to promote a sleep-like state with a diurnal rhythm. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and synthesized findings. Main results We included four studies with 149 randomized participants. We identified two studies awaiting classification for which we were unable to assess eligibility and one ongoing study. Participants differed in severity of illness as assessed by APACHE II scores in three studies and further differences existed between comparisons and methods. One study compared propofol versus no agent, one study compared different doses of propofol and two studies compared propofol versus a benzodiazepine (flunitrazepam, one study; midazolam, one study). All studies reported randomization and allocation concealment inadequately. We judged all studies to have high risk of performance bias from personnel who were unblinded. We noted that some study authors had blinded study outcome assessors and participants for relevant outcomes. It was not appropriate to combine data owing to high levels of methodological heterogeneity. One study comparing propofol with no agent (13 participants) measured quantity and quality of sleep using polysomnography; study authors reported no evidence of a difference in duration of sleep or sleep efficiency, and reported disruption to usual REM (rapid eye movement sleep) with propofol. One study comparing different doses of propofol (30 participants) measured quantity and quality of sleep by personnel using the Ramsay Sedation Scale; study authors reported that more participants who were given a higher dose of propofol had a successful diurnal rhythm, and achieved a greater sedation rhythmicity. Two studies comparing propofol with a different agent (106 participants) measured quantity and quality of sleep using the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; one study reported fewer awakenings of reduced duration with propofol, and similar total sleep time between groups, and one study reported no evidence of a difference in sleep quality. One study comparing propofol with another agent (66 participants) measured quantity and quality of sleep with the Bispectral Index and reported longer time in deep sleep, with fewer arousals. One study comparing propofol with another agent (40 participants) reported higher levels of anxiety and depression in both groups, and no evidence of a difference when participants were given propofol. No studies reported adverse events. We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of the evidence for each outcome to very low. We identified sparse data with few participants, and methodological differences in study designs and comparative agents introduced inconsistency, and we noted that measurement tools were imprecise or not valid for purpose. Authors' conclusions We found insufficient evidence to determine whether administration of propofol would improve the quality and quantity of sleep in adults in the ICU. We noted differences in study designs, methodology, comparative agents and illness severity amongst study participants. We did not pool data and we used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of our evidence to very low.",0
744,"To provide an update to the ""Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock,"" last published in 2008. A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development. The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations. Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure a parts per thousand yen65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0. 03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7-9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a Pao (2)/Fio (2) ratio of a parts per thousand currency sign100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao (2)/Fi o (2) < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose a parts per thousand currency sign180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5-10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven ""absolute""aEuro (TM) adrenal insufficiency (2C). Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.",0
745,"BACKGROUND: Sleep deprivation after major surgery is common and associated with worse outcome. Noise is one important reason for sleep fragmentation, which contributes to enhanced morbidity. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the impact of earplugs on patients' sleep quality during their first night after cardiothoracic surgery to eventually improve an existing fast-track concept. METHODS: Sixty-three patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery eligible for a postoperative fast-track regimen on our cardiothoracic post anesthesia care unit (C-PACU) were prospectively included. They were randomized to either sleep with or without earplugs. Quality of sleep was measured using questionnaires for patients and nurses. Required pain medications, pain intensity, and length of hospital stay were secondary outcome variables. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were randomized to the intervention group (earplugs) and 36 to the control group. Mean (SD) age was 61 (12) years. Self-reported quality of sleep was better in the intervention group (median, IQR [range]: 3, 2-4 [1-5] vs. 4, 3-5 [1-5]; scale: 1, ""excellent,"" to 5, ""very poor""; P=0.025). Patients of the intervention group also experienced less severe pain (P=0.047) despite similar dosages of administered analgesics and expressed improved satisfaction regarding their C-PACU stay (P=0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the use of earplugs in a fast-track concept following cardiothoracic surgery is efficient and easy. Earplugs improved the quality of sleep as well as patient satisfaction and attenuated pain intensity. They may thereby contribute to a faster recovery, less morbidity, and reduced costs.",0
746,"Background Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I-2 statistics, and assessment of study quality. Findings 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12.2 years (SD 4.1) to 68.0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27.9%; 95% CI 20.5-36.0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32.6%; 24.7-40.9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35.7%; 27.6-44.2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34.1%; 26.2-42.5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41.9%; 22.5-50.5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0.7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10.5%; 95% CI 7.5-14.1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12.1%; 8.6-16.3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12.3%; 7.7-17.7] of 171), irritability (28 [12.8%; 8.7-17.6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18.9%; 14.1-24.2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19.3%; 15.1-23.9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30.4%; 23.9-37.3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100.0%; 88.0-100.0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32.2% (95% CI 23.7-42. 0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14 .9% (12.1-18.2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14.8% (11.1-19.4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76.9%; 95% CI 68.1-84.6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35.3 months (SD 40.1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. Interpretation If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

747,"Introduction: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is anticipated to affect about eighteen percent of the population and five percent yearly. Furthermore, it has been suggested that about twenty percent of adults in the emergency department have AUD and that the incidence of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) in patients admitted to surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) varies from eight to forty percent, and most likely to be linked to infectious complications and have a higher mortality rate. It is estimated that up to fifty percent of AUD patients will experience withdrawal symptoms, a minority of whom needs management. AWS represents a clinical condition recognized by symptoms of autonomic hyperactivity like agitation, tremors, irritability, anxiety, hyperreflexia, confusion, hypertension, tachycardia, fever and diaphoresis. AWS often presents in alcoholdependent patients within six to twenty four hours after the sudden stop or reduction of alcohol intake. It is highly life-threatening condition. The severity can range from mild/moderate forms characterized by tremors, nausea, anxiety, and depression, to severe forms recognized by hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens and coma. The mild-moderate form of AWS is usually self-managed by patients or symptoms improves within two to seven days from the last drink, whereas the more severe AWS needs medical treatment. The recognition and further management of AWS is of great clinical value, as AWS is one of the causes of morbidity and mortality. Aim of work: In this review, we will discuss Alcohol withdrawal syndrome, manifestation and management Methodology: We did a systematic search for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, manifestation and management using PubMed search engine (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Google Scholar search engine (https://scholar.google.com). We only included full articles. Conclusions: AWS exemplifies a possibly life-threatening medical illness usually affecting AUD patients suddenly reducing or stopping alcohol intake. AWS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patients presenting with symptoms of autonomic hyperactivity. The use of a clinician-administered scale (CIWA-Ar or Alcohol Withdrawal Scale) is of great value to diagnose AWS and start adequate treatment. BZDs represent the gold standard treatment as a result both for their high rate of efficacy and being the only medications with proven ability to prevent the complicated forms of AWS (seizures, DTs). The management of AWS may be difficult. The primary phase is recognized by patient agitation and non-collaboration. This phase should be managed aggressively, to decrease the risk of medical complications (seizures, DTs, death), decrease patient suffering and improve quality of life. The direct effect of these measures will be, in most of cases, a strong physician-patient relationship. The latter is essential to enhance patient's disposition toward medical management and to start a long-term, multidisciplinary treatment of alcohol dependence. While BZD's addictive characteristics limit their long-term use, the possibility of using other medications able to be effective both for the management of AWS and the further long-term program for alcohol relapse prevention represents an advantage, i. e. carbamazepine, SMO, baclofen, gabapentin and topiramate. The initial administration of a non-BZD agent together with gold-standard treatments represents a useful choice to reduce the need for extra-dose BZD prescription (BZD-sparing drugs) and to start a medication with anti-craving characteristics. But it is highly essential to keep in mind that at present, BZDs are the most effective and manageable medications for the management of AWS.",0
748,"Introduction: Postoperative delirium is a common cognitive complication characterized by an abrupt disturbance in brain function after surgery. It occurs in 15 to 25% of patients undergoing major elective surgeries and up to 50% of patients who have had high-risk procedures such as cardiac surgery or hip fracture repair. Postoperative delirium can result in negative outcomes such as increased healthcare costs, increased length of stay, and lasting cognitive impairment. Although nurses play a critical role in recognizing delirium, the complication remains under-recognized and poorly managed. This finding emphasizes the need for improved delirium recognition and management strategies; therefore, educational initiatives designed to improve delirium care are necessary for nurses caring for patients with this complication. Objectives: This project evaluated the effect of structured delirium education on nursing knowledge, recognition, and management of delirium. Methods: This quality-improvement project utilized the Nurses' Delirium Knowledge Assessment (NDKA) tool, a 36-item scale divided into three subscales, to evaluate medical-surgical nurses' knowledge before and immediately following the implementation of an on-demand web-based delirium education module. It was available to nurses from October 2020 through December 2020. Participation in this project was voluntary and consisted of nurses working on two surgical units. Assessment scores were evaluated pre-and post-education and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to detect significant changes. Results: Sixteen nurses participated in the project. Overall mean scores improved from 67.99% on the pre-assessment to 81.84% on the post-assessment. Subscale mean scores also improved and were as follows: knowledge of assessment tools and scales 71.84% pre and 87.5% post, general knowledge of delirium 75.89% pre and 85.71% post, and risk factors for delirium 56.25% pre and 72.32% post. Conclusion: The educational intervention provided in this project increased nurses' knowledge and recognition of delirium, validating similar findings in the literature. An educational intervention delivered via electronic format is an effective method to provide delirium education to nurses. Improving nursing knowledge of delirium is essential in improving patient outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
749,"Comments on an article Y. S. Roh (see record [rid]2020-95495-001[/rid]). Ho agrees with Roh that the knowledge, skills and attitudes towards delirium care are essential parts of delirium care competency. This has been emphasized in Miller’s pyramid of clinical competence framework summarizing the individual levels of clinical competence ranging from ‘fact gathering’ (i.e. knowledge), over ‘interpretation/application’ (i.e. competence) and ‘demonstration of learning’ (i.e. performance) to ‘performance in practice’ (i.e. action). With ‘knowledge’ being the base of the pyramid, it is central to explore the level of knowledge among these competencies. Therefore, Ho would like to highlight the importance of delirium care knowledge assessment. Understanding the level of the delirium care knowledge among ICU nurses is of particular crucial to improve the awareness and management of ICU delirium. An appropriate measure of knowledge assessment such as a test/quiz type is more likely to achieve this goal. Ho believes a test/quiz type of knowledge assessment can help identify the gap between perceived self-report performance and actual performance with a more effective and objective focus.

750,"Delirium is a change in disturbance of consciousness and cognition, which temporarily develops over a short period of time and fluctuates. It is recommended that routine assessment and monitoring of delirium is very critical. The inappropriate identification and treatment can result in a lengthy hospital stay and prolonged length of mechanical ventilation days, which can lead to the delay in treatment, thereby increasing healthcare costs. The goal of this paper is to establish a foundation for the PICOt question. In critical care trained nurses 18 to 65 years old working in the ICU (P), will the education and utilization of the Confusion Assessment Method Tool-ICU (CAM-ICU), as opposed to no education or utilization (C) be effective in assessing delirium on adult patients admitted to the ICU (I) allowing for early intervention and /or treatment (O) over a 2 -month time frame (T)? A convenience sampling of 30 critical care nurses (n =30) employed at Olive view medical center (OVMC) working in the intensive care unit (ICU). The principal investigator conducted educational training on CAM-ICU tool to teach participants on delirium assessment prior to implementing the tool. Findings from the study indicate an increase in the mean of knowledge of the CAM ICU tool after education training. Mpretest = 56.80 (SD =13.60) and Mposttest = 90.63 (SD = 7.88), p <.05 indicating there was a statistically significant in the difference in mean CAM tool pretest and posttest education.

751,"Purpose: The purpose of this project was to determine if there is sufficient bedside ICU nurse buy-in to the Family HELP protocol to make implementation feasible at one county hospital in West Texas.Background: Delirium is an acute organ failure of the brain creating a state of confusion and biologic instability with implications for hemodynamic and respiratory stability, substantial functional decline, longer ICU stays, longer mechanical ventilation dependence, higher morbidity and mortality rates, and an estimated cost of $4 to $16 billion annually in the United States. Directed nonpharmacological interventions performed by family members have shown promise in reducing delirium symptom severity, need for antipsychotic medications, and delirium duration. Bedside nurse delivered education is highly successful in motivating behavioral and belief changes in families and begins an open communication between ICU staff and family members. The Family HELP protocol, a section of the larger HELP guidelines, brings together nonpharmacological interventions the family can use to effectively decrease delirium duration and severity and facilitates nurse-to-family teaching of these interventions to improve patient outcomes. Introducing Family-HELP as a partnership and co-operative care provides nurses with a framework to encourage family interaction with critically ill patients in a structured and meaningful way. Method: The design was pre and post paper-based surveys with education on the Family HELP protocol, and patient in-room poster placement. Surveys were anonymous with ballot box collection being available to the bedside ICU nurses for 1 week each. Questions were based on literature findings of expected outcomes, identified barriers and facilitators, and Calgary Family Intervention Method framework domains. Results: Survey participation was approximately half of nurses employed in the studied ICU. Analysis of the surveys showed a positive perception of family presence decreasing patient delirium symptoms, and a positive perception of the Family HELP protocol. The results described a high perception of family members as partners in care and high intention to implement the Family HELP protocol, indicating strong support of a full implementation of the protocol. Conclusion: The high level of nurse buy-in present in this study has large implications for the ability to implement the Family HELP protocol at this site in the near future, with sustainability and continued use supported by potential inclusion of the task in the electronic health record charting.

752,"Purpose: The purpose of this DNP project was to increase nurses' knowledge of the 'Assess and manage pain' component in working with adult critical care patients at Mercy Gilbert Medical Center. Evidence-based care practice content was included in the educational portion, with the ultimate goal of increasing compliance with the ABCDEF bundle at Mercy Gilbert Medical Center.Background: Approximately 77% of adult ICU patients have experienced pain during an intensive care unit (ICU) stay (Barr et al., 2013). Current clinical guidelines recommend using a pain, agitation, delirium (PAD) bundle to decrease delirium in the ICU by assessing pain first and screening for pain frequently (Barr et al., 2013; Devlin et al., 2018). The ABCDE bundle significantly decreases delirium (Devlin et al., 2018). Mercy Gilbert Medical Center serves a large population of adult ICU patients; therefore, the possibility of pain-related delirium among these patients is strong.Methods: This project used a pre-test/post-test quantitative design. Participants 1) completed a pre-test survey to evaluate knowledge and beliefs surrounding pain assessment and delirium; 2) viewed an educational presentation about pain assessment, delirium, and screening guidelines; and 3) completed a post-survey to evaluate any changes in knowledge and intention to screen for pain. Results were shared with ICU unit managers to help refine the education process for future testing cycles and other hospital sites.Results: A total final sample size of 11 ICU nurses completed the entire survey for a response rate of 14%. The highest proportion of respondents were ICU nurse females at 63.6%. The typical age range was 36–50 and years of practice were > 10 years. The education level was 54% had Bachelor's degrees in Nursing, 27% Associate's degrees in Nursing and 18% Masters in Nursing. There were significant differences pre- and post-test for knowledge of pain assessment. (The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that five of the participants who completed the surveys and educational video demonstrated statistically significant improvement from pre- and post-testing [p < 0.01].)Conclusions: DNP quality improvement projects like this one help develop strategies to increase best practices, leading to improved patient outcomes. Results may be used to develop strategies to increase and align provider practices with the best standards for promoting early identification and treatment of pain-induced delirium.

753,"Patients in hospital intensive care units are at increased risk to develop delirium, a condition which is characterized by a disturbance of consciousness and a change in cognition. Critical care nurses must have the knowledge to assess, recognize, and manage delirium. The purpose of this project was to develop an evidence-based policy for the assessment of delirium and a comprehensive nursing education plan which included an analysis and synthesis of the literature, a curriculum plan, and a pretest/posttest. The Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice Model framed the project, which used a multidisciplinary team approach. Two nursing leaders, each with a doctor of philosophy degree, served as content experts for the educational curriculum plan and the pretest/posttest. The curriculum plan was evaluated using a dichotomous scale of 1 = not met and 2 = met. An average score of 2 was achieved showing the content met the objectives. The pretest/posttest items were validated using a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = not relevant to 4 = very relevant. A content validation index score of 1.0 was computed, revealing that the items met the objectives and content of the curriculum. The pretest/posttest was administered before and after the educational program to determine the knowledge gained. A paired samples t test was conducted and found to have a statistically significant difference in the scores for the pretest (M = 81.25, SD = 11.29) and post-test (M = 94.06, SD = 7.12); t (31) = -5.92, p = 0.01, revealing that the critical care nurses gained significant knowledge with the delirium educational program. This project can promote positive social change because early recognition and management of the patient with delirium can facilitate positive outcomes for patients, families, and systems.

754,"Background: Delirium, an acute decline in cognition and attention, is a common and severe problem for hospitalized older adults, with incidence rates ranging from 11% to 56%, and 1.5 to 4.0-fold increased risk of death. Despite its multifaceted nature, delirium is preventable in 30% to 40% cases. A California academic community hospital experienced a higher incidence of delirium (30% to 40%) in adult non-critical care units as compared to delirium rates (11% to 29%) in similar hospital settings. The higher rates of delirium were believed to be due to fragmented, inconsistent, and non-individualized delirium care. Purpose/Objectives: The purpose of this evidence-based, quality improvement project was to determine whether a nurse-led Delirium Prevention Bundle (DPB) when compared to usual care, reduces delirium incidence in hospitalized geriatric patients. Method: The project was a two-group, pre-post design using the nurse-led DPB educational intervention for nurses. The project was implemented in two stages: 1) an educational session for nurses on completing the DPB including the Delirium Risk Factor Identification (DRFI) tool, targeted delirium prevention strategies (based on the Hospital Elder Life Program), and nursing documentation; and 2) the DPB implementation on a 26-bed geriatric unit at a 250-bed academic community medical center. Baseline data on delirium incidence rates were collected on eligible patients on the geriatric unit for one month before the intervention and prospectively on patients who were eligible following the educational intervention. Demographic data on eligible patients and unit nursing staff as well as nurse knowledge of delirium and adherence to the DPB were collected. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, t-tests, and chi-square test. Results: implementation of nursing education of the DPB, the addition of the DRFI tool, and documentation template in the hospital Electronic Health Record, was effective in reducing delirium incidence rate from 16% to 14% (p =<.001) and improving documentation compliance from <1% to 17%. Nurse delirium knowledge was also improved significantly (pre-test mean 80.0, post-test mean 94.3, p=.029). Conclusion: Nursing education utilizing the DPB is an effective approach in increasing nurse awareness of preventive care for delirium and decreasing incident delirium in this population.

755,"Approximately 10-30% of hospital admissions develop delirium where nearly 30-40% of the delirium cases are preventable. Non-detection rates by acute care healthcare workers were reported at 72-75%. Hence, it is crucial for hospitals to develop delirium education programs focused on early recognition and prevention. Thus, the purpose of this mixed method study was to develop and evaluate the effect of a delirium education program (DEP) on improving critical care nurses' knowledge and self-confidence in identifying delirium and the associated risk factors. In the quantitative strand (Phase I) of the study, both the intervention and control groups completed the online pre-tests and posttests consisting of demographic survey, Nurses'Knowledge of Delirium (NKD), and Confidence Scale (C-Scale). The intervention group attended the DEP that included an online education module followed by one-on-one case study/vignettes with role playing. Data analysis of Phase I informed the decisions regarding the sampling for the qualitative strand (Phase II). The quantitative data were analyzed utilizing a mixed model Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to test whether there were significant effects of the between group subject factor (group membership: intervention vs control), within group subject Time factor (pre-intervention vs post-intervention scores), and the Group by Time interaction. For Phase II, audio-taped phone interviews were conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of the nurses related to DEP. Dataset of the qualitative strand was then embedded into the quantitative dataset to come up with the final results of the study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0
756,"Excited delirium syndrome (ExDS) is a specific type of agitation in which individuals typically present in an extremely violent and uncontrollable manner. The actual existence of ExDS, which is not currently listed in the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), has been criticized by some as having been 'invented' to classify and ultimately justify deaths that occur in highly agitated individuals during police arrest and restraint. Many researchers, however, believe that ExDS has a long history and has been described using various terms over the past two centuries. Although ExDS does not always result in death, it does carry relatively high mortality compared to other acute behavioral emergencies. Similar to delirium generally, ExDS is a behavioral manifestation of a medical emergency. Knowledge of this condition is therefore significant for individuals who take care of patients in the acute setting, both in and out of the hospital. This includes law enforcement officers, emergency medical system (EMS) providers, critical care psychiatrists, and emergency physicians. This chapter details the history of ExDS, diagnosis and etiology, initial approach and workup, treatment options (benzodiazepines, first-generation antipsychotics, second-generation antipsychotics, ketamine, initial combination therapy, intravenous fluids, sodium bicrbonate, and cooling).

759,"In the United States, there is an urgent need for quality palliative and end-of-life care for patients at the end of life or living with life-limiting illnesses. Palliative and end-of-life training among nurses is inadequate and inconsistent. Little is known about nurses' knowledge and comfort when caring for the dying. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the influence of the CARE (Compassion and Respect at the End-of-life) Program and the CARES Tool at Huntington Hospital to empower nurses to deliver compassionate, dignified, and personalized nursing care at the end of life consistent with patient and family wishes. The study design was a one group pre-test/post-test intervention study using the End-of-Life Professional Caregiver Survey (EPCS) to measure nurses' knowledge and comfort about end-of-life care in the domains of patient- and family-centered communication, cultural and ethical values, and effective care delivery. Fifty-one participants were recruited, and 24 participants completed the post-surveys of EPCS and the CARES Tool Evaluation 6 weeks after the CARE Program training. Participants reported an 18% increase in scores in the domain of patient- and family-centered communication; 21% increase in scores in the domain of cultural and ethical values; and 18% increase in scores in the domain of effective care delivery. Participants without prior knowledge of care for the dying improved the most in all three domains, whereas participants working in critical care showed the least improvement in scores in all three domains. Item analyses of the EPCS questionnaire items revealed that most participants feel comfortable with being present with dying patients and with encouraging patients and families to complete advance care planning. The participants felt least comfortable in addressing requests for physician-assisted death. In addition, the CARES Tool was found to be an effective educational tool to improve knowledge and comfort of nurses to provide compassionate, person-centered care for patients at the end of life or living with life-limiting illnesses. The CARE Program and the CARES Tool have demonstrated effectiveness in increasing nurses' knowledge and comfort with end-of-life care and care delivery for patients with life-limiting illnesses. This study has provided original data and insights into the use of an evidence-based palliative care training program. Implications and suggestions for future research will include how the CARE Program and the CARES Tool impact patient and family outcomes, care satisfaction, physicians and other health care team members' end-of-life care practices, and nursing students' end-of-life care education and training.

760,"Up to one-quarter of patients admitted to acute hospitals have dementia and therefore caring for people with dementia is a significant part of adult nursing in secondary care, including critical care units. In order to identify patients with dementia, knowledge of symptoms is essential. These vary according to the type of dementia and also from person to person, but all types of dementia are characterized by progressive decline in multiple areas of function, including memory, reasoning, communication skills and the skills to carry out daily activities. The current position as regards diagnosis of dementia is another important issue, with figures suggesting that only 42% of people with dementia have a formal diagnosis. Another confounding factor in knowing which patients in critical care have dementia is distinguishing between dementia and delirium. Although it is unlikely that a diagnosis will be made whilst the patient is in critical care, identifying the early signs and making appropriate referrals to specialist services is vital. The most important reason for needing to know which patients in critical care have dementia is so that nurses can provide skilled appropriate interventions. Finally, ensuring that the environment in critical care units is as dementia friendly as possible is also important and will have an impact on the quality of experience for the individual.

761,"Delirium is a neurobehavioral syndrome caused by the transient disruption of normal neuronal activity secondary to systemic disturbances, and is the most common psychiatric syndrome found in the general hospital setting. In addition to causing distress to patients, families, and medical caregivers, the development of delirium has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, increased cost of care, increased hospital-acquired complications, poor functional and cognitive recovery, decreased quality of life, prolonged hospital stays, and increased placement in specialized intermediate and long-term care facilities. Clinical experience and research data suggest that once delirium has occurred, it is possible the patients may not return to their pre-delirium cognitive functional level. In fact, data suggests delirium the occurrence of delirium is associated with an increased risk of dementia, and acceleration in the rate of cognitive decline in those demented patients who develop delirium. Therefore, given increasing evidence that delirium is not always reversible, and given the potentially numerous negative sequelae associated with its development, physicians must do everything possible to prevent its occurrence. In order to prevent delirium, we recommend incorporating nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",0
762,"Background: Patients receiving critical care are experiencing post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSS) as a result of life-saving interventions received in the intensive care unit (ICU). PTSS is associated with poor patient outcomes and decreased quality of life compared to post-ICU patients without PTSS. Personal and clinical characteristics that place patients at higher risk for PTSS are still being examined. It is also unknown to what extent patients are being screened for ICU-induced PTSS. Objectives: This body of work aims to examine the risk factors associated with ICU-related PTSS and describe the screening experiences of patients who recently received care in an ICU. The work will be presented in three manuscripts. Methods: A single-center, descriptive, correlational design was used. Personal and clinical characteristics were obtained from medical records on a sample of 41 patients recently transferred out of the ICU. Two to 4 weeks after hospital discharge, patients completed the PTSS-14 and a Screening Experience Questionnaire via telephone. Screening experiences and the feasibility of the PTSS-14 in this population was described and associations between the personal and clinical characteristics and PTSS-14 scores were examined. Results: The first manuscript titled 'ICU-related PTSD; The Importance of Nurse Involvement' is under review at Critical Care Nurse. The purpose of this manuscript is to examine current literature addressing risk factors, negative health outcomes, and nursing roles in identifying patients at risk for PTSS. The second manuscript titled 'A Concept Analysis of ICU-related PTSD' is under review at Journal of Advanced Nursing . The purpose of this manuscript is to report a concept analysis of ICU-related PTSD. Manuscript three is titled 'Identification of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Post-ICU Patients' and is being submitted to  American Journal of Critical Care. The purpose of this manuscript is to report the study's results. It was found that the majority of patients were not screened, and none received education about the risk of PTSS after ICU care. The PTSS-14 was found to be an acceptable and feasible way to identify at risk patients and higher PTSS-14 scores were correlated with depression, moderate levels of sedation, number of days sedated, and delirium. Further research is needed to address strategies in implementing early screening for PTSS, and to determine if early identification and referral of at-risk patients can reduce the incidence of PTSD in this population.

763,"Introduction: As much as 8% of the general population is afflicted by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) throughout the lifespan. In the surgical setting, PTSD contributes to unique challenges for the anesthesia provider. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways serve to optimize the surgical experience of patients by establishing a set of interventions aimed at improving surgical outcomes. Many ERAS pathways exist for surgical specialties, yet few have been developed to provide patient-centered care that acknowledges comorbid disorders. This study will serve to create an evidence-based multimodal ERAS pathway for the patient with PTSD.Methods: Exhaustive literature search was concluded to identify assessments and interventions beneficial to the patient with PTSD in the perioperative and perianesthetic period. CINAHL, EBSCOhost, Cochrane Libraries and Google Scholar were searched for terms relating to PTSD, ERAS, and perioperative care. There is a lack of available research on PTSD and the perioperative environment. Gaps in literature were addressed by including relevant studies specifically applicable to the surgical care of PTSD patients. Five phases are ideal to separate interventions critical to the success and outcomes of the PTSD patients: prehospital, preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative and post-discharge. A pathway will be introduced to anesthesia providers for future implementation and study.Discussion: Literature suggests that identification and preparation of these patients is critical, but current practice guidelines do not address perioperative care. In line with common ERAS, interventions are categorized into 5 phases. Optimization of the patient is critical. The prehospital phase is one characterized by information gathering and preparation. Preoperative efforts should be focused on stress reduction, which include narrative communication. A 1mcg/kg bolus of dexmedetomidine should be administered prior to induction. Intraoperative efforts need to be preemptive and precautionary, and emergence must be a priority for all personnel. The postoperative phase is characterized by continued vigilance for ED assessment and prevention. Consistent care and providers must be maintained in a calm, private environment. After discharge, patient's progress should be monitored and communication maintained with any providers involved in recovery.Conclusion: This is the first known attempt at creating a comprehensive ERAS pathway for the PTSD patient. The prevalence of the disorder makes it a potentially daily comorbidity that anesthesia providers must manage. Assessment tools recommended for this pathway are easy to understand and are rapidly administered. Collaborative care is emphasized, which highlights the Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia Practice. This study offers a tangible product in order to bring about evidence-based changes to the clinical environment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)",0
764,"Adverse health outcomes among communities of color compared to their White, not Hispanic or Latino counterparts have existed throughout the history of the United States. Despite tremendous progress in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease as well as significant federal, state, and local efforts to address health inequities, many have increased in recent years. The World Health Organization states health inequities are mostly driven by social determinants of health (SDoH), which it defines as 'the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age'. Many studies have demonstrated that communities of color, compared to their White counterparts, typically fare worse across SDoH such as education, income, housing, working conditions, and access to health care and that they experience poorer health outcomes. Furthermore, additional studies have demonstrated correlations among such SDoH and between SDoH and health outcomes. Children whose parents have less than a high school education are more likely to live in neighborhoods without sidewalks, a library, or parks, playgrounds, or recreation centers. Similarly, lower levels of education have been shown to directly correlate with lower incomes and shorter life expectancy, and as incomes go down premature deaths increase. Differences in correlations by race and ethnicity have also been demonstrated, with poor people of color being more likely to experience concentrated poverty in their neighborhoods compared to their poor White counterparts. Critical Race Theory and Public Health Critical Race Theory argue that racism is at the root of these inequities and therefore must be addressed in order to achieve health equity. Unfortunately, despite extensive studies demonstrating individual behaviors are only a small part of what determines health, current research tends to focus on interpersonal racism without also examining institutional racism. This is the first of two primary inadequacies with current strategies for examining the role of race and ethnicity in the relationships between SDoH. Current practices tend to emphasize individual risk and responsibility without considering how such behaviors may be initiated and sustained as a result of cultural and social contexts. The purpose of this study was to utilize existing population-level data to explore latent SDoH factors to better understand the underlying population-level contributors to racial and ethnic health inequities, the implications of such inequities, and the geographical scales in which they emerge, all of which are essential as the field of public health shifts towards placing a greater emphasis on health equity. Population-level interventions are the foundation of public health practice, and there is a common understanding among public health researchers and practitioners that interventions gain greater efficacy when they are intentionally tailored and delivered to meet the unique community, social, and cultural contexts of groups most impacted by the health concern. The field of public health is increasingly using summary measures of population health based on aggregated individual-level health indicators in research and evaluation efforts. Measures such as life expectancy and years of life lost are common examples of this approach. However, while population-based approaches to healthy living are a core element of public health, calculating population-level measures to comprehensively examine SDoH has been far less common, thus limiting opportunities to examine SDoH and other elements associated with the root causes of population-level inequities. Racial and ethnic residential segregation is one of the most studied population-level constructs associated with racial and ethnic health inequities. Segregation has been demonstrated to contribute to racial and ethnic health inequities even after controlling… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)",0
765,"Background: Early detection, prevention, and treatment of delirium after cardiac surgery are important for quick postoperative recovery. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) may be an easy-to-use instrument for detecting delirium in clinical practice. Objectives: To compare the congruent validity of the CAM with the results from repeated assessments by using a combination of the Organic Brain Syndrome Scale and the Mini-Mental State Examination according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) criteria for delirium. Methods: Patients aged 70 years or older undergoing cardiac surgery were assessed on postoperative days 1 and 4, and the 2 diagnostic methods were compared. The sensitivity and specificity of the CAM were examined. The reference method allowed categorization of delirium into subgroups of psychomotor activities and psychiatric symptom profiles, which were compared with the CAM results. Results: Postoperative delirium was diagnosed in 78 of 141 patients (55.3%). According to the CAM, 59 patients (41.8%) were categorized as delirious, 53 correctly. Thus, the sensitivity was 68% and the specificity was 90%, indicating false-negative rather than false-positive observations. Conclusion: Patients with psychomotor hyperactivity and mixed psychotic-emotional symptoms were more likely to have delirium detected via the CAM than were patients with less obvious clinical manifestations of delirium. Repetitive cognitive testing and psychogeriatric experience are probably necessary to improve the results obtained with the CAM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0

767,"Research published in 2016 identified strategies to enhance acute and critical care, initiated discussions on professional roles and responsibilities, clarified complex care issues, and led to robust debate. Some of this important work addressed strategies to prevent delirium and pressure ulcers, considerations for pain management within the context of the opioid abuse crisis, strategies to guide fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis and heart failure, and ways to enhance care for family members of intensive care patients.The new sepsis definitions highlight the importance of detecting and providing care to patients with sepsis outside of critical care areas. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy is an example of the advancement of research in genomics and personalized medicine and of the need to understand the care implications of these therapies. Other research topics include interprofessional collaboration and shared decision-making as well as nurses' role in family conferences.

768,"Background Delirium in older adults is considered a medical emergency; it contributes to a cascade of functional decline and to increased mortality. Early recognition of delirium symptoms is critical to prevent these negative consequences. Family caregivers who are educated about delirium could partner with nurses and other healthcare professionals in early recognition of delirium symptoms. Before implementing such partnership models, it is important to examine the effectiveness of educating family caregivers about delirium. Aims To examine whether providing education on delirium to family caregivers improved their knowledge, emotional state, or response in reducing the incidence of delirium in older adults. Methods For this systematic review, we conducted literature searches in CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Social Sciences in ProQuest, Dissertations and Theses, and the Virginia Henderson Global Nursing eRepository for studies published in the English language between January 2000 and June 2015. Criteria for inclusion were: (a) primary focus on educating family caregivers for older adults about delirium; (b) use of experimental, quasi‐experimental, or comparative design; (c) measured family caregiver outcomes of delirium knowledge, emotional state, or response in reducing delirium incidence in older adults; and (d) published in the English language. Articles were appraised using Melnyk's rapid critical appraisal guides. Results Seven studies met the review criteria. Four studies found that family caregivers’ delirium knowledge increased; two noted that delirium incidence in older adults declined; and one study reported less distress following receipt of education. Linking Evidence to Action Providing family caregivers with information about delirium can be beneficial for both family caregivers and older adults. However, rigorous evaluation of education programs for family caregivers about delirium is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0

770,"Background: Australians seeking health care from any public hospital have the right to non-discriminatory safe medical assessment, treatment and nursing care. The literature clearly indicates that people presenting to public hospitals with acute alcohol- or drug-related conditions are at risk of dying by being denied medical and nursing treatment. This denial of treatment is on the basis that their presumed condition is solely drug- and alcohol-related. There is often even a greater risk for Aboriginal people who present for treatment. This literature comprises reports from coronial inquiries, police incidents, safety audits, and critical incidents in health services, and anecdotal information from specialist drug and alcohol nurses. Such violation of this vulnerable population's right to safe health care has often resulted in suicide and other preventable deaths, disability and exacerbation of physical and mental illness. Method: A critique was conducted of recent available Australian 'grey' literature comprising coronial and police reports, local critical incident alert systems in hospital reports and anecdotal information from specialist drug and alcohol nurses associated with three case studies. Findings: The reports revealed that some of the people seeking treatment for alcohol-, drug-and mental health-related crises, who were denied treatment, subsequently died in police custody, shelters, home, public places or elsewhere. The evidence showed that many who died did so because medical and nursing staff presumed they were just 'alcoholic' or 'drunk' and therefore were not seriously injured or ill. Commonly, stereotyping and racism were found to influence a health professional's decision to refuse treatment, and their unethical practice was directly linked to deaths because of missed or wrong diagnoses and poor standards of nursing assessment. Several cases, all occurring recently in South Australian country areas, were identified through a critical incident alert system and re-confirmed by local specialist drug and alcohol nurses who were aware of each case. One case was an Aboriginal man and two others were non-Aboriginal men. All were relatively young. Each man was denied proper medical assessment, treatment and safe nursing care by staff in the hospitals in which they sought help. As a consequence, the Aboriginal man developed delirium tremens requiring medical retrieval by air to a major teaching hospital for intensive care. The other two men required extensive support and intervention due to acute mental illnesses that co-existed with their drug use. Discussion: This review offers important information from which to build strategies to remediate poor policies, practices, and attitudes. Hopefully, these strategies may assist to prevent similar situations occurring in the future. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0

Physicians who complete the exercises in this workbook can improve their clinical decision making, advance their communication and diagnostic abilities, evaluate their knowledge and clinical skills, learn leading-edge clinical information, and most importantly, improve patient care. The dynamic patient management exercises included here are derived from material in FOCUS: The Journal of Lifelong Learning in Psychiatry. These exercises are designed to test clinical considerations beyond the typical multiple-choice testing approach. They describe diagnostic and therapeutic questions in a clinical narrative that follows a patient through the passage of time. Each vignette closely resembles an actual patient presentation, including contradictory or confusing constellations of symptoms and introduction of new and critical information that was unexpected by the physician. These clinical vignettes can help refine diagnostic skills and sharpen practitioners' clinical decision making. This book is meant to be used in a program of continuous professional development. It will help psychiatrists assess their processes of evaluation, diagnosis, and clinical management. These exercises may also be useful in preparing for board-type examinations, and they have been found to promote discussion and learning for individuals of various levels of experience, ranging from seasoned clinicians to psychiatric residents.

774,"Delirium is a common presentation of deteriorating health in older people. It is potentially deleterious in terms of patient experience and clinical outcomes. Much of what is known about delirium is through positivist research, which forms the evidence base for disease-based classification systems and clinical guidelines. There is little systematic study of nurses' day-to-day practice of nursing patients with delirium. The aim was to uncover the kinds of knowledge that informs nurses' care and to explicate the basis of that knowledge. Critical Discourse Analysis is underpinned by the premise that powerful interests within society mediate how social practices are constructed. Links were made between the grammatical and lexical features of nurses' language about care in interviews and naturalistic settings, and the healthcare context. Care focused on the continuous surveillance of patients with delirium by nurses themselves or vicariously through other patients, and containment. Nurses influenced by major discourses of risk reduction and safety, constructed patients with delirium as risk objects. The philosophy of person-centred and dignified care advocated in nursing literature and government policy is an emerging discourse, though little evident in the data. The current dominant discourses on safety must give space to discourses of dignity and compassion.",0
775,"OBJECTIVE: Although medical intensive care unit nurses at our institution routinely use the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) to identify delirium, physicians rely on traditional diagnostic methods. We sought to measure the effect of physicians' use of the ICDSC on their ability to detect delirium. DESIGN: Before-after study. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit of an academic medical center. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 25 physicians with >or=1 month of clinical experience in the medical intensive care unit conducted 300 delirium assessments in 100 medical intensive care unit patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physicians sequentially evaluated two patients for delirium using whatever diagnostic method preferred. Following standardized education regarding ICDSC use, each physician evaluated two different patients for delirium using the ICDSC. Each physician assessment was preceded by consecutive, but independent, evaluations for delirium by the patient's nurse and then a validated judge using the ICDSC. Before (PRE) physician ICDSC use, the validated judge identified delirium in five patients; the physicians and nurses identified delirium in zero and four of these patients, respectively. The physicians incorrectly identified delirium in four additional patients. After (POST) physician ICDSC use, the validated judge identified delirium in 11 patients; the physicians and nurses identified delirium in eight and ten of these patients, respectively. The physicians incorrectly identified delirium in one patient. After physician ICDSC use, agreement improved between both the physicians and validated judge (PRE kappa = -0.14 [95% confidence interval {CI} = -0.27 to -0.02] to POST kappa = 0.67 [95% CI = 0.38 to 0.96]) and physicians and nurses (PRE kappa = -0.15 [95% CI = -0.29 to -0.02] to POST kappa = 0.58 [95% CI = 0.25 to 0.91]). Nurses vs. validated judge agreement was strong in both periods (PRE kappa = 0.65 [95% CI = 0.29 to 1.00] and POST kappa = 0.92 [95% CI = 0.76 to 1.00]). CONCLUSIONS: Use of the ICDSC, along with education supporting its use, improves the ability of physicians to detect delirium in the medical intensive care unit.",0

786,"Background Delirium is a common and serious problem among acutely unwell persons. Alhough linked to higher rates of mortality, institutionalisation and dementia, it remains underdiagnosed. Careful consideration of its phenomenology is warranted to improve detection and therefore mitigate some of its clinical impact. The publication of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5) provides an opportunity to examine the constructs underlying delirium as a clinical entity. Discussion Altered consciousness has been regarded as a core feature of delirium; the fact that consciousness itself should be physiologically disrupted due to acute illness attests to its clinical urgency. DSM-5 now operationalises ‘consciousness’ as ‘changes in attention’. It should be recognised that attention relates to content of consciousness, but arousal corresponds to level of consciousness. Reduced arousal is also associated with adverse outcomes. Attention and arousal are hierarchically related; level of arousal must be sufficient before attention can be reasonably tested. Summary Our conceptualisation of delirium must extend beyond what can be assessed through cognitive testing (attention) and accept that altered arousal is fundamental. Understanding the DSM-5 criteria explicitly in this way offers the most inclusive and clinically safe interpretation.",0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases from database inception until August 13, 2018, with no restrictions. RESULTS: Of 9635 abstracts, 20 studies were included. Older age was not associated with any delirium subtype in 4/7 (57%) studies. Sex was not associated with any delirium subtype in 4/4 (100%) studies. Mortality was consistently associated with hypoactive delirium in 4/7 (57%) studies. The evidence supporting the association of APACHE-II score, mechanical ventilation, length of stay, duration of delirium and removal of tubes were inconsistent across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Although included studies reported on many subtype-specific risk factors and outcomes, heterogeneity in reporting and methodological quality limited the generalizability of the results and the evidence for many subtype-specific risk factors or outcomes is inconsistent across studies. Standardized methodology and the creation of a universal template for collecting data in ICU delirium studies are essential moving forward; helping to identify subtype-specific risk factors or outcomes and strengthen the association of potential risk factors or outcomes.",0
791,"OBJECTIVE: Delirium, a common behavioral manifestation of acute brain dysfunction in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), is a significant contributor to mortality and worse long-term outcome. Antipsychotics, especially haloperidol, are commonly administered for the treatment and prevention of delirium in critically ill patients while the evidence for the safety and efficacy of these drugs is still lacking. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the benefits of haloperidol for the prevention of delirium in ICU patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We made a systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eight RCTs with 2806 patients were included. The prophylactic use of haloperidol did not reduce the delirium incidence (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.69-1.71), the duration of delirium (MD: -0.33, 95% CI: -1.25-0.588) and the delirium/coma free days (MD: 0.08, 95% CI: -0.06-0.23). We did not find an increase of extrapyramidal effects (RR: 1.86, 95% CI: 0.30-11.39), QTc prolongation (RR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.79-1.55) and arrhythmias (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.72-2.19). The use of haloperidol did not increase the ICU (MD: 0.77, 95% CI: -0.28-1.83) and hospital length of stay (MD: -0.57, 95% CI: -1.32-0.18). Haloperidol did not increase the sedation level (RR: 1.88, 95% CI: 0.76-4.63) and mortality (RR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.83-1.18). CONCLUSIONS: Haloperidol did not reduce the delirium incidence, the delirium duration, the delirium/coma free-days and did not increase the incidence of extrapyramidal effects, arrhythmias, the ICU and hospital length of stays and sedation.",0
792,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors for each area of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and to determine their effect size. REVIEW METHOD USED: This study used systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library were searched. REVIEW METHODS: Eighty-nine studies were selected for the review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The PICS areas and risk factors reported in the individual studies were reviewed and categorised. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the quality of studies. The effect size of each risk factor was calculated as odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: There were 33 mental health studies, 15 cognitive impairment studies, 32 physical impairment studies, eight studies on two areas, and one study on all three areas. Sixty risk factors were identified, including 33 personal and 27 intensive care unit (ICU)-related factors. Significant risk factors for mental health included female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 3.37, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-10.17), previous mental health problems (OR = 9.45, 95% CI: 2.08-42.90), and negative ICU experience (OR = 2.59, 95% CI: 2.04-3.28). The only significant risk factor for cognitive impairment was delirium (OR = 2.85, 95% CI: 1.10-7.38). Significant risk factors for physical impairment included older age (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.11-4.33), female sex (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.32-2.91), and high disease severity (OR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.76-3.66). CONCLUSIONS: Although PICS is a multidimensional concept, each area has been studied separately. Significant risk factors for PICS included older age, female sex, previous mental health problems, disease severity, negative ICU experience, and delirium. To prevent PICS, the multidisciplinary team should pay attention to modifiable risk factors such as delirium and patients' ICU experience.",0
794,"OBJECTIVE: Summarize performance and development of ICU delirium-prediction models published within the past 5 years. DATA SOURCES: Systematic electronic searches were conducted in April 2019 using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature to identify peer-reviewed studies. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were published in English during the past 5 years that specifically addressed the development, validation, or recalibration of delirium-prediction models in adult ICU populations. DATA EXTRACTION: Screened citations were extracted independently by three investigators with a 42% overlap to verify consistency using the CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eighteen studies featuring 23 distinct prediction models were included. Model performance varied greatly, as assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.62-0.94), specificity (0.50-0.97), and sensitivity (0.45-0.96). Most models used data collected from a single time point or window to predict the occurrence of delirium at any point during hospital or ICU admission, and lacked mechanisms for providing pragmatic, actionable predictions to clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: Although most ICU delirium-prediction models have relatively good performance, they have limited applicability to clinical practice. Most models were static, making predictions based on data collected at a single time-point, failing to account for fluctuating conditions during ICU admission. Further research is needed to create clinically relevant dynamic delirium-prediction models that can adapt to changes in individual patient physiology over time and deliver actionable predictions to clinicians.",0
795,"Objective:          To update and expand the 2013 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Pain, Agitation, and Delirium in Adult Patients in the ICU.         Design:          Thirty-two international experts, four methodologists, and four critical illness survivors met virtually at least monthly. All section groups gathered face-to-face at annual Society of Critical Care Medicine congresses; virtual connections included those unable to attend. A formal conflict of interest policy was developed a priori and enforced throughout the process. Teleconferences and electronic discussions among subgroups and whole panel were part of the guidelines’ development. A general content review was completed face-to-face by all panel members in January 2017.         Methods:          Content experts, methodologists, and ICU survivors were represented in each of the five sections of the guidelines: Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and Sleep (disruption). Each section created Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome, and nonactionable, descriptive questions based on perceived clinical relevance. The guideline group then voted their ranking, and patients prioritized their importance. For each Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome question, sections searched the best available evidence, determined its quality, and formulated recommendations as “strong,” “conditional,” or “good” practice statements based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation principles. In addition, evidence gaps and clinical caveats were explicitly identified.         Results:          The Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and Sleep (disruption) panel issued 37 recommendations (three strong and 34 conditional), two good practice statements, and 32 ungraded, nonactionable statements. Three questions from the patient-centered prioritized question list remained without recommendation.         Conclusions:          We found substantial agreement among a large, interdisciplinary cohort of international experts regarding evidence supporting recommendations, and the remaining literature gaps in the assessment, prevention, and treatment of Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and Sleep (disruption) in critically ill adults. Highlighting this evidence and the research needs will improve Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and Sleep (disruption) management and provide the foundation for improved outcomes and science in this vulnerable population.",0
796,"Rationale: Physical restraints are used liberally in some intensive care units (ICUs) to prevent patient harm from device removal or falls. Although the intention of restraint use is patient safety, their application may inadvertently cause physical or psychological harm. Physical restraints may contribute to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but there is a paucity of supportive data.Objectives: To investigate the association between physical restraint use and PTSD symptoms in ICU survivors. Secondary objectives were to examine the cognitive and physical outcomes associated with physical restraint use and to assess interventions that may be effective in reducing restraint use.Methods: A systematic review of English language studies in PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL between January 1, 1990, to February 8, 2020 was performed. Observational or randomized studies that reported on restraint use and associated outcomes, or interventions to reduce restraint use, in critically ill adult patients were identified. Two independent reviewers completed the review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines.Results: We identified 794 articles, of which 37 met inclusion criteria and were included. Thirty of these studies related to patient outcomes including PTSD, delirium, mechanical ventilation hours, and physical injury. Seven related to interventions to reduce physical restraint use. The quality of studies was not high; only four of the included studies were assessed to have a low risk of bias. Three studies found a significant relationship between restraint use and PTSD, but their results could not be pooled for analysis. Pooled data indicated a significant association between physical restraint use and delirium (odds ratio [OR], 11.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.66-20.01; P < 0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference in days, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.95-4.75; P < 0.001). We also found that interventions, such as nursing education, may effectively reduce restraint use by approximately 50% (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.32-0.73; P < 0.001). The impact that a reduction in restraint use may have on associated outcomes was not examined.Conclusions: Physical restraint use may be associated with PTSD in ICU survivors and is associated with delirium and longer duration of mechanical ventilation. Nurse education is likely effective in reducing rates of physical restraint among ICU patients.",0
797,"IntroductionThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic represents the largest contemporary challenge to the nursing workforce in the 21st century given the high stress and prolonged strain it has created for both human and healthcare supply resources. Nurses on the frontlines providing patient care during COVID-19 have faced unrivaled psychological and physical demands. However, no known large-scale qualitative study has described the emotions experienced by nurses providing patient care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Objective: Therefore, the purpose of this study was to qualitatively describe the emotions experienced by US nurses during the initial COVID-19 pandemic response.MethodsOne hundred individual interviews were conducted with nurses across the United States from May to September of 2020 asking participants to describe how they felt taking care of COVID-19 patients. All interviews followed a semi-structured interview guide, were audio recorded, transcribed, verified, and coded by the research team.ResultsParticipants narratives of the emotions they experienced providing patient care during COVID-19 unequivocally described (1) moral distress, and moral distress related (1.1) fear, (1.2) frustration, (1.3) powerlessness, and (1.4) guilt. In sum, the major emotional response of nurses across the US providing patient care during the pandemic was that of moral distress.ConclusionInvestments in healthcare infrastructures that address moral distress in nurses may improve retention and reduce burnout in the US nursing workforce.",0
798,"Background Delirium in patients in the intensive care unit is associated with adverse outcomes. Nurses experience many difficulties in caring for those with delirium, which can lead to nurse burnout, prevent effective care for patients, and negatively impact the patient. The identification of factors creating challenges for nurses is, therefore, important to enable intervention. Objectives The aim of this study was to develop a new scale to assess the difficulties faced by nurses caring for patients with delirium in the intensive care unit and to examine its reliability and validity. Methods We based our draft scale items on literature reviews and interviews. Four experts evaluated the collected items. After a pilot study, 211 nurses working in intensive care units in Japan completed the questionnaire. Subsequent statistical analysis of results included factor validity, construct validity, known-group validity, internal consistency, and test–retest reliability. Results Exploratory factor analysis extracted a scale of 33 items with eight factors and an additional scale of four items with one factor. The analysis of construct validity suggested a possible association with the Strain of Care for Delirium Index. In the known-group validity, a comparison with two groups based on experience in the intensive care unit found significant differences among the five factors. Internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.68–.87) and test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients = .46–.62) were confirmed. Conclusion We developed a difficulty scale for nurses caring for patients with delirium in the intensive care unit and confirmed its reliability and validity. The difficulty factors were developed with the intention to identify educational interventions for nurses and the introduction of new organisational resources, such as manpower and providing emotional support and feedback to nurses.",0
799,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is the most common cerebral dysfunction in the intensive care unit (ICU) and can be subdivided into a hypoactive, hyperactive, or mixed motor subtype based on the clinical manifestation. The aim of this review was to describe the distribution, pharmacological interventions, and outcomes of delirium motor subtypes in ICU patients. METHODS: This systematic scoping review was performed according to the PRISMA-ScR and Cochrane guidelines. We performed a systematic search in six major databases to identify relevant studies. A meta-regression analysis was performed where pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals were computed by a random effect model. RESULTS: We included 131 studies comprising 13,902 delirious patients. There was a large between-study heterogeneity among studies, including differences in study design, setting, population, and outcome reporting. Hypoactive delirium was the most prevalent delirium motor subtype (50.3% [95% CI 46.0-54.7]), followed by mixed delirium (27.7% [95% CI 24.1-31.3]) and hyperactive delirium (22.7% [95% CI 19.0-26.5]). When comparing the delirium motor subtypes, patients with mixed delirium experienced the longest delirium duration, ICU and hospital length of stay, the highest ICU and hospital mortality, and more frequently received administration of specific agents (antipsychotics, α2-agonists, benzodiazepines, and propofol) during ICU stay. In studies with high average age for delirious patients (> 65 years), patients were more likely to experience hypoactive delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoactive delirium was the most prevalent motor subtype in critically ill patients. Mixed delirium had the worst outcomes in terms of delirium duration, length of stay, and mortality, and received more pharmacological interventions compared to other delirium motor subtypes. Few studies contributed to secondary outcomes; hence, these results should be interpreted with care. The large between-study heterogeneity suggests that a more standardized methodology in delirium research is warranted.",0
800,"Aims The purpose of this systematic review and meta-summary was the aggregation of the empirical qualitative literature on patients’ experiences of delirium in order to support the development and implementation of patient-oriented delirium management and to guide future research. Design We conducted a systematic literature review of qualitative research published between January 1980 and June 2019. Data sources In June 2019, we searched in Medline, CINAHL, SSCI and PsycInfo to identify relevant reports. In addition, we conducted searches in three dissertation databases (BASE, DART and ProQuest) and Google Scholar. Review methods We used methods developed by Sandelowski and Barroso to construct a meta-summary of the findings by extracting them from the reports, abstracting them into meta- findings and calculating their manifest interstudy frequency effect sizes. Results Out of the 742 identified records, 24 reports based on delirium experience accounts of 483 patients met our criteria and were included. One thousand ninety-seven findings were extracted from these reports and abstracted into 92 meta-findings. These were grouped to the five emerging themes ‘perception’, ‘emotions’, ‘interaction with others’, ‘dealing with delirium’ and ‘influence on further life’. Conclusion Delirium is commonly perceived as an overall distressing condition, which can accompany and influence patients even after hospital discharge. Impact This systematic review and meta-summary is the most comprehensive aggregation of qualitative research of the patient delirium experience to date. It allows us to better understand, extract meaning from, and weigh the qualitative findings in their context by calculating their manifest frequency effect sizes. This can be used to support the development and implementation of delirium management concepts.",0
801,"Aims: The aim of this narrative synthesis was to explore the necessary and sufficient conditions required to define moral distress. Background: Moral distress is said to occur when one has made a moral judgement but is unable to act upon it. However, problems with this narrow conception have led to multiple redefinitions in the empirical and conceptual literature. As a consequence, much of the research exploring moral distress has lacked conceptual clarity, complicating attempts to study the phenomenon. Design: Systematic literature review and narrative synthesis (November 2015–March 2016). Data sources: Ovid MEDLINE® In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 1946–Present, PsycINFO® 1967–Present, CINAHL® Plus 1937–Present, EMBASE 1974–24 February 2016, British Nursing Index 1994–Present, Social Care Online, Social Policy and Practice Database (1890–Present), ERIC (EBSCO) 1966–Present and Education Abstracts. Review methods: Literature relating to moral distress was systematically retrieved and subjected to relevance assessment. Narrative synthesis was the overarching framework that guided quality assessment, data analysis and synthesis. Results: In all, 152 papers underwent initial data extraction and 34 were chosen for inclusion in the narrative synthesis based on both quality and relevance. Analysis revealed different proposed conditions for the occurrence of moral distress: moral judgement, psychological and physical effects, moral dilemmas, moral uncertainty, external and internal constraints and threats to moral integrity. Conclusion: We suggest the combination of (1) the experience of a moral event, (2) the experience of ‘psychological distress’ and (3) a direct causal relation between (1) and (2) together are necessary and sufficient conditions for moral distress.",0
802,"OBJECTIVES:          To determine the effect of daily written updates on the satisfaction and psychologic symptoms of families of ICU patients.         DESIGN:          Randomized controlled trial.         SETTING:          Single, urban academic medical center.         SUBJECTS:          Surrogates of nondecisional, critically ill adults with high risk of mortality (n = 252) enrolled from June 2019 to January 2021.         INTERVENTIONS:          Usual communication with the medical team with or without written communication detailing the suspected cause and management approach of each ICU problem, updated each day.         MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:          Participants completed surveys at three time points during the ICU stay: enrollment (n = 252), 1 week (n = 229), and 2 weeks (n = 109) after enrollment. Satisfaction with care was measured using the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory (CCFNI). The presence of anxiety, depression, and acute stress were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R). CCFNI, HADS, and IES-R scores were similar among participants assigned to the intervention group and control group upon enrollment and during the first week after enrollment (p > 0.05). From enrollment to the second week after enrollment, there was an improvement in CCFNI and HADS scores among participants assigned to the intervention group versus the control group. At week 2, CCFNI scores were significantly lower among participants in the intervention group versus the control group, indicating greater satisfaction with care: 15.1 (95% CI, 14.2–16.0) versus 16.4, (95% CI, 15.5–17.3); p = 0.04. In addition, 2 weeks after enrollment, the odds of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and acute stress among participants assigned to the intervention versus control group were 0.16 (95% CI, 0.03–0.82; p = 0.03); 0.15 (95% CI, 0.01–1.87; p = 0.14); and 0.27 (95% CI, 0.06–1.27; p = 0.10), respectively.

804,"The experience of moral distress can be distinguished from the experience of moral dilemmas. In moral distress, a nurse knows the morally right course of action to take, but institutional structure and conflicts with other co-workers create obstacles. A nurse who fails to act in the face of obstacles also may have reactive distress in addition to the initial distress. Both kinds of distress pose dilemmas about individual and collective moral responsibility. Coping with these dilemmas effectively requires taking at least some successful actions to resolve distress.",0

806,"Nursing is considered to be an at-risk profession of burnout due to daily exposure to difficult situations such as death and pain care. In addition, some units such as the intensive care unit (ICU), can be stressful due to high levels of morbidity and mortality and ethical dilemmas. Burnout causes a deterioration in quality of care, increasing the risk of mortality in patients due to poor performance and errors in the healthcare environment. The aim of this study was to analyse the levels, prevalence and related factors of burnout in ICU nurses. A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out in the Medline, Scopus and CINAHL databases. Fifteen articles were found for the systematic review and four for the meta-analysis. With a sample of n = 1986 nurses, the meta-analytic estimate prevalence for high emotional exhaustion was 31% (95% CI, 8–59%), for high depersonalization was 18% (95% CI, 8–30%), and for low personal accomplishment was 46% (95% CI, 20–74%). Within the dimensions of burnout, emotional exhaustion had a significant relationship with depression and personality factors. Both sociodemographic factors (being younger, single marital status, and having less professional experience in ICU) and working conditions (workload and working longer hours) influence the risk of burnout syndrome.",0
807,"Nursing is associated with high levels of emotional strain and heavy workloads. Changing working conditions raise the importance of investigating job satisfaction, stress and burnout and its consequences for nurses. The aim of the study was to investigate whether work-related behaviour and experience patterns are associated with mental and physical health status in nurses. A sample of 356 nurses in four German hospitals were interviewed using questionnaires regarding work-related behaviour and experience patterns, work stress, depression, anxiety and physical symptoms ('Work-related Behaviour and Experience Pattern'--AVEM and ERI). The main result of this study is that unhealthy work-related behaviour and experience patterns (i.e. the excessive ambitious type and the resigned type) are associated with reduced mental and physical health. Preventive, as well as intervention, strategies are needed that focus both on the individual as well as on working conditions.",0
808,"The number of registered nurses (RNs) in the United States is roughly 3 times the number of physicians and surgeons, making RNs a critically important component of the US health care system. Registered nurse burnout-the state of emotional exhaustion in which the individual feels overwhelmed by work to the point of feeling fatigued, unable to face the demands of the job, and unable to engage with others-is a real concern, having been reported in many hospitals. The purpose of this research was to examine the causes and consequences of burnout syndrome among RNs in US hospitals and its role in the RN shortage in hospitals. The methodology involved a review of the literature and semistructured interviews. Seven primary databases, 2 websites, and 43 articles were consulted in this project. Findings indicated that burnout syndrome in RNs can be analyzed in terms of 4 clusters of characteristics: individual, management, organizational, and work. The consequences of burnout syndrome have increased RN turnover rates, poor job performance, and threats to patient safety. Burnout syndrome was more prevalent in hospitals with a higher number of patients per nurse and among younger RNs. Registered nurse burnout in hospitals has negatively impacted the quality of care, patient safety, and the functioning of staff workers in the health care industry.",0

810,"BACKGROUND: To meet the increasing demand for healthcare providers, it is crucial to recruit and retain more nurse anaesthetists (NAs). The majority of NAs in the Netherlands are >45 years old, and retaining them in their jobs is very important. This study investigates the relationships among burnout, physical health and job satisfaction among Dutch NAs. METHODS: Two thousand NAs working in Dutch hospitals were invited to participate in this online questionnaire. We tested the relationships among burnout, psychosomatic symptoms, sickness absence, perceived general health and job satisfaction. RESULTS: Nine hundred and twenty-three questionnaires were completed and analysed (46% response rate). Burnout and psychosomatic symptoms were negatively associated with job satisfaction, and predicted 27% of job satisfaction. Perceived general health was positively and sickness absence was negatively related to job satisfaction. Older NAs had a higher incidence of burnout than their younger counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed the importance of a healthy psychosocial work environment for promoting job satisfaction. To prevent burnout, further research is necessary to determine the factors causing stress. These findings may also apply to anaesthesiologists who share many tasks and work in close cooperation with NAs.",0
811,"Objective To determine whether there is an association between healthcare professionals’ wellbeing and burnout, with patient safety. Design Systematic research review. Data Sources PsychInfo (1806 to July 2015), Medline (1946 to July 2015), Embase (1947 to July 2015) and Scopus (1823 to July 2015) were searched, along with reference lists of eligible articles. Eligibility Criteria for Selecting Studies Quantitative, empirical studies that included i) either a measure of wellbeing or burnout, and ii) patient safety, in healthcare staff populations. Results Forty-six studies were identified. Sixteen out of the 27 studies that measured wellbeing found a significant correlation between poor wellbeing and worse patient safety, with six additional studies finding an association with some but not all scales used, and one study finding a significant association but in the opposite direction to the majority of studies. Twenty-one out of the 30 studies that measured burnout found a significant association between burnout and patient safety, whilst a further four studies found an association between one or more (but not all) subscales of the burnout measures employed, and patient safety. Conclusions Poor wellbeing and moderate to high levels of burnout are associated, in the majority of studies reviewed, with poor patient safety outcomes such as medical errors, however the lack of prospective studies reduces the ability to determine causality. Further prospective studies, research in primary care, conducted within the UK, and a clearer definition of healthcare staff wellbeing are needed. Implications This review illustrates the need for healthcare organisations to consider improving employees’ mental health as well as creating safer work environments when planning interventions to improve patient safety.

812,"Several studies have linked treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with negative psychological outcomes. This study explores the prevalence of negative psychological outcomes in Greek patients (N=29), a year after treatment in ICU. Percentages of participants with anxiety [41%, 95% CI (22%, 60%)] and Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) [34%, 95% CI (16%, 53%)] symptoms were similar to the related literature. Percentages of participants with depressive [17%, 95% CI (3%, 32%)] symptoms were rather low. Only 10% of participants reported absence of quality of live issues. Anxiety symptoms were related to desire to talk about the ICU experience (p=0.010), duration of propofol administration (p=0.018) and loss of employment (p=0.019) and negatively related to duration of stay in the ICU (p=0.025). PTSD symptoms were related to experiencing other stressors during the year after the ICU stay (p=0.001), social constraint (p=0.003), duration of propofol administration (p=0.004), loss of employment (p=0.020), low income (p=0.022) and negative ICU memories (p=0.029). Depressive symptoms were related to loss of employment (p=0.003), low income (p=0.029) and social constraint (p=0.033). Patients experience elevated levels of psychological symptoms long after they are discharged from the hospital. Several psychosocial factors emerged as important factors to consider for predicting levels of distress.",0

814,"BACKGROUND: Clinical nursing practice may involve moral distress, which has been reported to occur frequently when nurses care for dying patients. Palliative sedation is a practice that is used to alleviate unbearable and refractory suffering in the last phase of life and has been linked to distress in nurses. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore nurses' reports on the practice of palliative sedation focusing on their experiences with pressure, dilemmas and morally distressing situations. METHODS: In-depth interviews with 36 nurses working in hospital, nursing home or primary care. RESULTS: Several nurses described situations in which they felt that administration of palliative sedation was in the patient's best interest, but where they were constrained from taking action. Nurses also reported on situations where they experienced pressure to be actively involved in the provision of palliative sedation, while they felt this was not in the patient's best interest. The latter situation related to (1) starting palliative sedation when the nurse felt not all options to relieve suffering had been explored yet; (2) family requesting an increase of the sedation level where the nurse felt that this may involve unjustified hastening of death; (3) a decision by the physician to start palliative sedation where the patient had previously expressed an explicit wish for euthanasia. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses experienced moral distress in situations where they were not able to act in what they believed is the patient's best interest. Situations involving moral distress require nurses to be well informed and able to adequately communicate with suffering patients, distressed family and physicians.",0
815,"BACKGROUND: The intensive care unit (ICU) stay has been linked with a number of physical and psychological sequelae, known collectively as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Specific ICU follow-up services are relatively recent developments in health systems, and may have the potential to address PICS through targeting unmet health needs arising from the experience of the ICU stay. There is currently no single accepted model of follow-up service and current aftercare programmes encompass a variety of interventions and materials. There is uncertain evidence about whether follow-up services effectively address PICS, and this review assesses this. OBJECTIVES: Our main objective was to assess the effectiveness of follow-up services for ICU survivors that aim to identify and address unmet health needs related to the ICU period. We aimed to assess effectiveness in relation to health-related quality of life (HRQoL), mortality, depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), physical function, cognitive function, ability to return to work or education and adverse effects.Our secondary objectives were to examine different models of follow-up services. We aimed to explore: the effectiveness of service organisation (physician- versus nurse-led, face-to-face versus remote, timing of follow-up service); differences related to country (high-income versus low- and middle-income countries); and effect of delirium, which can subsequently affect cognitive function, and the effect of follow-up services may differ for these participants. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL on 7 November 2017. We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and non-randomised studies with adult participants, who had been discharged from hospital following an ICU stay. We included studies that compared an ICU follow-up service using a structured programme and co-ordinated by a healthcare professional versus no follow-up service or standard care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesised findings. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included five studies (four randomised studies; one non-randomised study), for a total of 1707 participants who were ICU survivors with a range of illness severities and conditions. Follow-up services were led by nurses in four studies or a multidisciplinary team in one study. They included face-to-face consultations at home or in a clinic, or telephone consultations or both. Each study included at least one consultation (weekly, monthly, or six-monthly), and two studies had up to eight consultations. Although the design of follow-up service consultations differed in each study, we noted that each service included assessment of participants' needs with referrals to specialist support if required.It was not feasible to blind healthcare professionals or participants to the intervention and we did not know whether this may have introduced performance bias. We noted baseline differences (two studies), and services included additional resources (two studies), which may have influenced results, and one non-randomised study had high risk of selection bias.We did not combine data from randomised studies with data from one non-randomised study. Follow-up services for improving long-term outcomes in ICU survivors may make little or no difference to HRQoL at 12 months (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.1 to 0.1; 1 study; 286 participants; low-certainty evidence). We found moderate-certainty evidence from five studies that they probably also make little or no difference to all-cause mortality up to 12 months after ICU discharge (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.22; 4 studies; 1289 participants; and in one non-randomised study 79/259 deaths in the intervention group, and 46/151 in the control group) and low-certainty evidence from four studies that they may make little or no difference to PTSD (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10, 703 participants, 3 studies; and one non-randomised study reported less chance of PTSD when a follow-up service was used).It is uncertain whether using a follow-up service reduces depression and anxiety (3 studies; 843 participants), physical function (4 studies; 1297 participants), cognitive function (4 studies; 1297 participants), or increases the ability to return to work or education (1 study; 386 participants), because the certainty of this evidence is very low. No studies measured adverse effects.We could not assess our secondary objectives because we found insufficient studies to justify subgroup analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found insufficient evidence, from a limited number of studies, to determine whether ICU follow-up services are effective in identifying and addressing the unmet health needs of ICU survivors. We found five ongoing studies which are not included in this review; these ongoing studies may increase our certainty in the effect in future updates. Because of limited data, we were unable to explore whether one design of follow-up service is preferable to another, or whether a service is more effective for some people than others, and we anticipate that future studies may also vary in design. We propose that future studies are designed with robust methods (for example randomised studies are preferable) and consider only one variable (the follow-up service) compared to standard care; this would increase confidence that the effect is due to the follow-up service rather than concomitant therapies.",0
816,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To synthesise the evidence reported in qualitative studies concerning the lived experiences of adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU have been reported to suffer from severe physical and emotional responses such as hopelessness, anxiety, high levels of frustration and stress. Recent improvements in the field of mechanical ventilation and sedative medications as experienced by patients that can inform nursing care have not been summarised to date. DESIGN: A systematic review of qualitative studies followed by a meta-synthesis and a meta-summary was performed. METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched by two authors in June 2019. A total of nine studies were included and evaluated based on their methodological quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. RESULTS: A total of 24 codes emerged from the abstraction process, which were categorised into 11 categories and four themes: (a) ""The effect of the intense stress on the body's systems,"" (b) ""The induced negative emotional situations,"" (c) ""The feeling of being cared for in a hospital setting"" and (d) ""The perceived support from the family and loved ones."" Furthermore, the most frequent codes across studies were ""Being afraid,"" ""Feeling supervised,"" ""Feeling comforted,"" ""Failing to communicate,"" and ""Experiencing difficulties in breathing,"" with an intensity of 66.6%. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving mechanical ventilation have expressed a general sense of vulnerability, of which critical care nurses need to be aware. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Findings suggest the need for improvements at the nursing, unit, educational and policy levels; furthermore, more research is also required at the international levels given the current trends towards no sedation protocols for the management of ICU patients: listening to their experiences becomes imperative, in order to ensure an awake, comfortable and ventilator-tolerant patient.",0
817,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: This systematic literature review explores and maps what we know about survivorship to understand how survivorship can be theoretically defined. BACKGROUND: Survivorship of critical illness has been identified as a challenge for the 21st Century. Whilst the use of the term 'survivorship' is now common in critical care, it has been borrowed from the cancer literature where the discourse on what survivorship means in a cancer context is ongoing and remains largely descriptive. In the absence of a theoretical understanding, the term 'survivorship' is often used in critical illness in a generic way, limiting our understanding of what survivorship is. The current COVID-19 pandemic adds to an urgency of understanding what intensive care unit (ICU) survivorship might mean, given the emerging long-term consequences of this patient cohort. We set out to explore how survivorship after critical illness is being conceptualised and what the implications might be for clinical practice and research. DESIGN: Integrated systematic literature review. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. PRISMA guidelines were followed and a PRISMA checklist for reporting systematic reviews completed. RESULTS: The three main themes around which the reviewed studies were organised are: (a) healthcare system; (b) ICU survivors' families; and (c) ICU survivor's identity. These three themes feed into an overarching core theme of 'ICU Survivorship Experiences'. These themes map our current knowledge of what happens when a patient survives a critical illness and where we are in understanding ICU survivorship. CONCLUSION: We mapped in this systematic review the different pieces of the jigsaw that emerge following critical illness to understand and see the bigger picture of what happens after patients survive critical illness. It is evident that existing research has mapped these connections, but what we have not managed to do yet is defining what survivorship is theoretically. We offer a preliminary definition of survivorship as a process but are aware that this definition needs to be developed further with patients and families.",0
818,"The aim of this study was to synthesize quantitative research that identified ranking lists of the most severe stressors of patients in the intensive care unit, as perceived by patients, relatives, and health care professionals (HCP). We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library from 1989 to 15 May 2020. Data were analyzed with descriptive and semi-quantitative methods to yield summarizing ranking lists of the most severe stressors. We synthesized the results of 42 prospective cross-sectional observational studies from different international regions. All investigations had assessed patient ratings. Thirteen studies also measured HCP ratings, and four studies included ratings of relatives. Data indicated that patients rate the severity of stressors lower than HCPs and relatives do. Out of all ranking lists, we extracted 137 stressor items that were most frequently ranked among the most severe stressors. After allocation to four domains, a group of clinical ICU experts sorted these stressors with good to excellent agreement according to their stress levels. Our results may contribute to improve HCPs' and relatives' understanding of patients' perceptions of stressors in the ICU. The synthesized stressor rankings can be used for the development of new assessment instruments of stressors.",0
819,"OBJECTIVES: Compared with noncardiac critical illness, critically ill postoperative cardiac surgical patients have different underlying pathophysiologies, are exposed to different processes of care, and thus may experience different outcome trajectories. Our objective was to systematically review the outcomes of cardiac surgical patients requiring prolonged intensive care with respect to survival, residential status, functional recovery, and quality of life in both hospital and long-term follow-up. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Dissertations and Theses Global up to July 21, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they assessed hospital or long-term survival and/or patient-centered outcomes in adult patients with prolonged ICU stays following major cardiac surgery. After screening 10,159 citations, 114 articles were reviewed in full; a final 34 articles met criteria for data extraction. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Studies. Extracted data included the used definition of prolonged ICU stay, number and characteristics of prolonged ICU stay patients, and any comparator short stay group, length of follow-up, hospital and long-term survival, residential status, patient-centered outcome measure used, and relevant score. DATA SYNTHESIS: The definition of prolonged ICU stay varied from 2 days to greater than 14 days. Twenty-eight studies observed greater in-hospital mortality among all levels of prolonged ICU stay. Twenty-five studies observed greater long-term mortality among all levels of prolonged ICU stay. Multiple tools were used to assess patient-centered outcomes. Long-term health-related quality of life and function was equivalent or worse with prolonged ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: We found consistent evidence that patients with increases in ICU length of stay beyond 48 hours have significantly increasing risk of hospital and long-term mortality. The significant heterogeneity in exposure and outcome definitions leave us unable to precisely quantify the risk of prolonged ICU stay on mortality and patient-centered outcomes.",0
820,"BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in patient outcomes following critical illness, with an increasing number and different types of studies conducted, and a need for synthesis of existing findings to help inform the field. For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies evaluating patient outcomes after hospital discharge for survivors of critical illness. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL databases from inception to June 2015. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the study population was >50 % adults discharged from the ICU, with qualitative evaluation of patient outcomes. Studies were excluded if they focused on specific ICU patient populations or specialty ICUs. Citations were screened in duplicate, and two reviewers extracted data sequentially for each eligible article. Themes related to patient outcome domains were coded and categorized based on the main domains of the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) framework. RESULTS: A total of 2735 citations were screened, and 22 full-text articles were eligible, with year of publication ranging from 1995 to 2015. All of the qualitative themes were extracted from eligible studies and then categorized using PROMIS descriptors: satisfaction with life (16 studies), including positive outlook, acceptance, gratitude, independence, boredom, loneliness, and wishing they had not lived; mental health (15 articles), including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and irritability/anger; physical health (14 articles), including mobility, activities of daily living, fatigue, appetite, sensory changes, muscle weakness, and sleep disturbances; social health (seven articles), including changes in friends/family relationships; and ability to participate in social roles and activities (six articles), including hobbies and disability. CONCLUSION: ICU survivors may experience positive emotions and life satisfaction; however, a wide range of mental, physical, social, and functional sequelae occur after hospital discharge. These findings are important for understanding patient-centered outcomes in critical care and providing focus for future interventional studies aimed at improving outcomes of importance to ICU survivors.",0
821,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To theorise intensive care unit survivorship after a critical illness based on longitudinal qualitative data. BACKGROUND: Increasingly, patients survive episodes of critical illness. However, the short- and long-term impact of critical illness includes physical, psychological, social and economic challenges long after hospital discharge. An appreciation is emerging that care needs to extend beyond critical illness to enable patients to reclaim their lives postdischarge with the term 'survivorship' being increasingly used in this context. What constitutes critical illness survivorship has, to date, not been theoretically explored. DESIGN: Longitudinal qualitative and constructivist grounded theory. Interviews (n = 46) with 17 participants were conducted at four time points: (1) before discharge from hospital, (2) four to six weeks postdischarge, (3) six months and (4) 12 months postdischarge across two adult intensive care unit setting. METHOD: Individual face-to-face interviews. Data analysis followed the principles of Charmaz's constructivist grounded theory. 'Intensive care unit survivorship' emerged as the core category and was theorised using concepts such as status passages, liminality and temporality to understand the various transitions participants made postcritical illness. FINDINGS: Intensive care unit survivorship describes the unscheduled status passage of falling critically ill and being taken to the threshold of life and the journey to a life postcritical illness. Surviving critical illness goes beyond recovery; surviving means 'moving on' to life postcritical illness. 'Moving on' incorporates a redefinition of self that incorporates any lingering intensive care unit legacies and being in control of one's life again. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: For healthcare professionals and policymakers, it is important to realise that recovery and transitioning through to survivorship happen within an individual's time frame, not a schedule imposed by the healthcare system. Currently, there are no care pathways or policies in place for critical illness survivors that would support intensive care unit survivors and their families in the transitions to survivorship.",0
822,"PURPOSE: It is unknown how sepsis survivors conceptualize health-related quality of life (HRQL). We aimed to identify important HRQL domains for this population. METHODS: A literature search was performed to inform an interview guide. Open-ended interviews were held with 15 purposefully sampled sepsis survivors. Interview transcripts were analyzed by interpretative phenomenological analysis to allow themes to develop organically. Resulting codes were reviewed by an independent expert. The preliminary list of domains was rated in a two-round Delphi consensus procedure with therapists and survivors. RESULTS: Eleven domains emerged as critically important: Psychological impairment, Fatigue, Physical impairment, Coping with daily life, Return to normal living, Ability to walk, Cognitive impairment, Self-perception, Control over one's life, Family support, and Delivery of health care. Sepsis survivors want a ""normal life,"" to walk again, and to regain control without cognitive impairment. Family support is essential to overcome sepsis aftermaths. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors described many HRQL domains which are not captured by the QoL instruments that have traditionally been used to study ICU survivorship (i.e., SF-36 and EQ-5D). Future studies of QoL in ICU survivors should consider using both a traditional instrument so that results are comparable to previous research, as well as a more holistic QoL measurement instrument like the WHOQOL-BREF.",0

825,"Rationale: Physical restraints are used liberally in some intensive care units (ICUs) to prevent patient harm from device removal or falls. Although the intention of restraint use is patient safety, their application may inadvertently cause physical or psychological harm. Physical restraints may contribute to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but there is a paucity of supportive data. Objectives: To investigate the association between physical restraint use and PTSD symptoms in ICU survivors. Secondary objectives were to examine the cognitive and physical outcomes associated with physical restraint use and to assess interventions that may be effective in reducing restraint use. Methods: A systematic review of English language studies in PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL between January 1, 1990, to February 8, 2020 was performed. Observational or randomized studies that reported on restraint use and associated outcomes, or interventions to reduce restraint use, in critically ill adult patients were identified. Two independent reviewers completed the review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Results: We identified 794 articles, of which 37 met inclusion criteria and were included. Thirty of these studies related to patient outcomes including PTSD, delirium, mechanical ventilation hours, and physical injury. Seven related to interventions to reduce physical restraint use. The quality of studies was not high; only four of the included studies were assessed to have a low risk of bias. Three studies found a significant relationship between restraint use and PTSD, but their results could not be pooled for analysis. Pooled data indicated a significant association between physical restraint use and delirium (odds ratio [OR], 11.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.66–20.01; P < 0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference in days, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.95–4.75; P < 0.001). We also found that interventions, such as nursing education, may effectively reduce restraint use by approximately 50% (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.32–0.73; P < 0.001). The impact that a reduction in restraint use may have on associated outcomes was not examined. Conclusions: Physical restraint use may be associated with PTSD in ICU survivors and is associated with delirium and longer duration of mechanical ventilation. Nurse education is likely effective in reducing rates of physical restraint among ICU patients.",0
826,"Purpose. The purpose of this research was to determine the extent to which anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms were experienced by a sample of patients after discharge from intensive care units (ICUs). The participants had a mean stay of 3 days in ICUs in a level 1 academic hospital in Gauteng, South Africa. Methods. A prospective, quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive design was used to investigate these variables. A preliminary record review of the hospital’s ICU bed occupancy for the previous year was 1 596. The total study sample was 98 (N=98) to ensure that a power of at least 95% accuracy was acquired for the 0.05 level of significance testing. The instruments used in the structured interview were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) developed by Zigmond and Snaith (1983) and the Experience after Treatment in Intensive Care 7-Item scale (ETIC-7) developed by Scragg, Jones and Fauvel (2001). Data were analysed using STATA 10. Findings. Just under half the sample population (48%) had symptoms of anxiety, more than a quarter had symptoms of depression (28%), and 32% had symptoms of PTS. Furthermore, it was elicited that 58% of the sample had combined anxiety and depressive symptoms severe enough to have a ‘possible clinical disorder’. An unexpected finding of this study was that patients who had memory of physical restraints in the ICU were six times more likely to develop symptoms of PTS than those with no memory of physical restraint. Conclusions. It was observed in this study that a significant number of ICU patients returning to the community develop psychological sequelae related to their admission and the treatments necessary, e.g. mechanical ventilation. This psychological distress can affect patients’ physical recovery (by an altered and decreased immune function), their quality of life and their functioning in the family and in society. Clinical relevance. The prevalence of psychological sequelae after treatment in an ICU was found to be high. At present ICU staff in South Africa have limited evidence on which to base decisions about improvements to critical care practice and the psychological sequelae following treatments in an ICU. Critical illness and the recovery from it do not end at the ICU door, and patients should be identified, followed up and offered the necessary support.",0

828,"BACKGROUND: Being a patient in an intensive care unit (ICU) and being mechanically ventilated is a scary and unpleasant experience to many patients. Qualitative studies describe these Patients' experiences, but the findings have not yet been synthesised. AIM: The aim of this study was to gather and synthesise interpreted knowledge from qualitative studies about Patients' experiences of being mechanically ventilated in an ICU. METHOD: A qualitative metasynthesis was conducted on findings from nine qualitative studies performed in the period from 1994 to 2012. The studies were critically appraised according to the method defined by Sandelowski and Barosso, and the findings were extracted, edited, grouped and abstracted. Subsequently, the abstracted findings were analysed, using the constant comparison analysis. In the analysis, we used findings from patients with home ventilation and findings from patients admitted to an ICU, while they were not ventilated. RESULTS: Fifteen abstracted findings appeared from the metasynthesis and led to the synthesised finding: 'Being dependent on health professionals, without being able to communicate, causes experiences with anxiety, fear and loneliness. How intensively these feelings are experienced seems to depend on the health professionals' ability of being present with these patients. The presence of relatives can alleviate these experiences'. CONCLUSION: This study shows that patients being mechanically ventilated in an ICU experience an emic vulnerability, consisting of anxiety, fear and loneliness. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In future practice, it is expected that patients will be more awake during mechanical ventilation. It is therefore important that health professionals have the knowledge that their presence and their support of the relationship between the patient and his/her relatives are of great importance in the care of patients.",0
829,"AIM: To investigate patients' psychological distress in relation to memory and stressful experiences in the intensive care unit (ICU), and to identify early predictors for the development of high levels of acute post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed over 18 months in two general ICUs, including 313 intubated mechanically ventilated adults admitted for more than 24 h, 226 of whom completed the study. Patients were interviewed 5 days and 2 months post-ICU concerning their memories and psychological distress. The instruments used were the ICU Memory Tool, ICU Stressful Experience Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS: High symptom levels of anxiety, depression and acute PTSD 2 months post-ICU were present in 4.9%, 7.5% and 8.4% of the 226 patients, respectively. Psychological distress 2 months post-ICU was associated with experiences of the ICU rated as extremely stressful and with high levels of anxiety and depression 5 days post-ICU, but not with amnesia or delusional memories without factual recall of the ICU. Female sex, signs of agitation (increasing proportion of Motor Activity Assessment Scale scores of 4-6) and feelings of extreme fear during the ICU stay were significantly and independently associated with IES-R scores of 30 or more. CONCLUSIONS: Extremely stressful experiences of the ICU are associated with subsequent psychological distress. Female sex, agitation and extreme fear during the ICU stay seem to increase the risk of developing high levels of acute PTSD-related symptoms.",0
830,"INTRODUCTION: There is growing evidence of poor mental health and quality of life among survivors of intensive care. However, it is not yet clear to what extent the trauma of life-threatening illness, associated drugs and treatments, or patients' psychological reactions during intensive care contribute to poor psychosocial outcomes. Our aim was to investigate the relative contributions of a broader set of risk factors and outcomes than had previously been considered in a single study. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 157 mixed-diagnosis highest acuity patients was conducted in a large general intensive care unit (ICU). Data on four groups of risk factors (clinical, acute psychological, socio-demographic and chronic health) were collected during ICU admissions. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and quality of life were assessed using validated questionnaires at three months (n = 100). Multivariable analysis was used. RESULTS: At follow-up, 55% of patients had psychological morbidity: 27.1% (95% CI: 18.3%, 35.9%) had probable PTSD; 46.3% (95% CI: 36.5%, 56.1%) probable depression, and 44.4% (95% CI: 34.6%, 54.2%) anxiety. The strongest clinical risk factor for PTSD was longer duration of sedation (regression coefficient = 0.69 points (95% CI: 0.12, 1.27) per day, scale = 0 to 51). There was a strong association between depression at three months and receiving benzodiazepines in the ICU (mean difference between groups = 6.73 points (95% CI: 1.42, 12.06), scale = 0 to 60). Use of inotropes or vasopressors was correlated with anxiety, and corticosteroids with better physical quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Strikingly high rates of psychological morbidity were found in this cohort of intensive care survivors. The study's key finding was that acute psychological reactions in the ICU were the strongest modifiable risk factors for developing mental illness in the future. The observation that use of different ICU drugs correlated with different psychological outcomes merits further investigation. These findings suggest that psychological interventions, along with pharmacological modifications, could help reduce poor outcomes, including PTSD, after intensive care.",0
831,"BACKGROUND: Patients may suffer extreme psychological reactions in intensive care units (ICU), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after leaving hospital. Previous systematic reviews of studies up to 2007 found that the true prevalence of and consistent risk factors for PTSD after ICU were not established, due to methodological shortcomings of studies. Therefore we aimed to conduct a systematic review of observational studies of post-ICU PTSD from 2008-2012, and to compare them to 1997-2007 studies, with regard to quality, prevalence estimates and risk factors. METHODS: We used a pre-specified protocol, and systematic, explicit methods to identify, select and critically appraise studies. Studies in general ICU settings with mixed-diagnosis patients (N.>30) were included. Risk of bias was assessed, with lower-risk studies given greater weight. No quantitative synthesis was possible due to heterogeneity, therefore ranges of estimates and frequencies of risk factors were examined. RESULTS: The review included 26 papers, 13 from 1997-2007 and 13 from 2008-2012. There were more high quality studies in the latter period. The range of prevalence estimates from high-quality studies was similar; 8% to 27% (1997-2007) and 9% to 27% (2008-2012). Clinical risk factors consistently identified over the two periods were use of benzodiazepines, duration of sedation and mechanical ventilation. Psychological risk factors include stress and fear experienced acutely in ICU, and frightening memories of the admission. CONCLUSION: The quality and number of post-ICU PTSD studies has increased over time, and we can be more confident in the accumulated findings. Evidence from both periods suggests that up to 27% of ICU survivors suffer from PTSD. There is also increasing evidence that use of benzodiazepines and duration of sedation, along with fear, stress and delirium in the ICU are likely risk factors for subsequent PTSD.",0
832,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to summarize and critically review data on the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in general intensive care unit (ICU) survivors, risk factors for post-ICU PTSD and the impact of post-ICU PTSD on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review using Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO and a hand-search of 13 journals. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were eligible. The median point prevalence of questionnaire-ascertained ""clinically significant"" PTSD symptoms was 22% (n=1,104), and the median point prevalence of clinician-diagnosed PTSD was 19% (n=93). Consistent predictors of post-ICU PTSD included prior psychopathology, greater ICU benzodiazepine administration and post-ICU memories of in-ICU frightening and/or psychotic experiences. Female sex and younger age were less consistent predictors, and severity of critical illness was consistently not a predictor. Post-ICU PTSD was associated with substantially lower HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PTSD in ICU survivors is high and negatively impacts survivors' HRQOL. Future studies should comprehensively address how patient-specific factors (e.g., pre-ICU psychopathology), ICU management factors (e.g., administration of sedatives) and ICU clinical factors (e.g., in-ICU delirium) relate to one another and to post-ICU PTSD. Clinicians caring for the growing population of ICU survivors should be aware of PTSD risk factors and monitor patients' needs for early intervention.",0

ICU survivors with mental health disorders showed worse HRQoL scores in both physical and mental dimensions than those without. The higher the number of psychiatric syndromes manifested, the worse the mental dimension of HRQoL. Age of < 65 years (<i>P</i> = .009), history of depression (<i>P</i> = .009), anxiety (<i>P</i> = .003) and depression (<i>P</i> = .02) symptoms at ICU discharge, physical dependence (<i>P</i> = .01), and decreased physical functional status (<i>P</i> = .04) at 6 months were associated with anxiety. History of depression (<i>P</i> = .001), depression symptoms at ICU discharge (<i>P</i> < .001), and decreased physical functional status at 6 months (<i>P</i> = .01) were associated with depression. Depression symptoms at ICU discharge (<i>P</i> = .01), physical dependence (<i>P</i> = .01), and decreased physical functional status (<i>P</i> = .02) at 6 months were associated with PTSD.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>The network of potential risk factors for mental illness among patients discharged from an ICU is complex and involves multiple factors (age, premorbid mental health, acute emotional stress, and physical impairment after ICU stay). The negative impact of the burden of mental illness on HRQoL among critical care survivors is of concern.</p>",0
834,"OBJECTIVES: To study memories of ICU following discharge, their associations, and impact on mental health and quality of life in a low- and middle-income country. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort; data on memories (pain, fear, nightmare, factual), clinical and demographic variables, anxiety-depression, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and quality of life were collected 0, 7, 14, 30, 90, and 180 days post discharge. Home visits for assessment minimized loss to follow-up. Linear mixed-models and regression analyses were used to estimate adjusted effects of memories controlling for age, sex, time, and severity of illness. SETTING: Twenty-five bedded ICU of a tertiary care center in East India. PATIENTS: Adult ICU survivors between January 2017 and July 2018 able to communicate their memories. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Final sample consisted of 322 patients who completed 180 days follow-up. Pain, fear, factual, and nightmare memories dropped from 85%, 56%, 55%, and 45% at discharge to less than or equal to 5% at 180 days. Patients with gaps in ICU memory had worse anxiety-depression, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and quality of life at all follow-up points. Sedation (odds ratio, 0.54; CI, 0.4-0.7), steroids (odds ratio, 0.47; CI, 0.3-0.8), benzodiazepines (odds ratio, 1.74; CI, 1-3.04), and mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 0.43; CI, 0.2-0.8) were independently associated with gaps in memory. Non-ICU factor such as substance addiction (odds ratio, 5.38; CI, 2-14) was associated with memories affecting mental health and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Gaps in memory and various memory types were common after ICU admission, whose prevalence waned over time. Compared with nightmares and fearful memories, gaps in memories were most strongly associated with poor mental health and quality of life. Identifying patients with gaps in memories might be an objective way of planning interventions to improve their long-term outcomes.",0
835,"During ICU admissions efforts should be made towards identifying and psychologically supporting those patients with a previous history of a psychiatric disease, as they are at considerably higher risk of suffering from the long-term psychological sequelae of ICU admission.",0
836,"PURPOSE: We investigated the impact of delirium on illness severity, psychological state, and memory in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with very long ICU stay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study in the medical-surgical ICUs of 2 teaching hospitals. Very long ICU stay (>75days) and prolonged delirium (≥40days) thresholds were determined by ROC analysis. Subjects were ≥18years, full-code, and provided informed consent. Illness severity was assessed using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV, Simplified Acute Physiology Score-3, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. Psychological impact was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and the 14-question Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSS-14). Memory was assessed using the ICU Memory Tool survey. RESULTS: 181 subjects were included. Illness severity did not correlate with delirium duration. On logistic regression, only PTSS-14<49 correlated with delirium (p=0.001; 95% CI 1.011, 1.041). 49% remembered their ICU stay clearly. 47% had delusional memories, 50% reported intrusive memories, and 44% reported unexplained feelings of panic or apprehension. CONCLUSION: Delirium was associated with memory impairment and PTSS-14 scores suggestive of PTSD, but not illness severity.",0
837,"BACKGROUND: The association between intensive care unit (ICU) survivors' psychological sequelae, individual care needs, and discharge disposition has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To describe depressive symptoms and anxiety in ICU survivors and explore these symptoms based on individual care needs and discharge disposition for 4 months post-ICU discharge. METHODS: We analyzed data from 39 ICU survivors who self-reported measures of depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression 10 items [CESD-10]) and anxiety (Shortened Profile of Mood States-Anxiety subscale [POMS-A]). RESULTS: A majority of patients reported CESD-10 scores above the cut off (≥ 8) indicating risk for clinical depression. POMS-A scores were highest within 2 weeks post-ICU discharge and decreased subsequently. Data trends suggest worse depressive symptoms and anxiety when patients had moderate to high care needs and/or were unable to return home. CONCLUSION: ICU survivors who need caregiver assistance and extended institutional care reported trends of worse depressive symptoms and anxiety.",0
838,"OBJECTIVE: To study posttraumatic stress in patients after treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 136 adult patients with critical medical and surgical problems who were discharged from the ICU of the Caritas Medical Centre, Hong Kong. Their occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression after ICU treatment were measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Patient ICU experience was measured using the ICU Memory Tool. Multivariable analyses were conducted to examine the predictors of PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and depression. RESULTS: Symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression were reported in 10% to 17% of patients. Symptom severity was associated with less factual memory, more vivid memory of feelings about and more delusional memory of the ICU experience, low emotional support, and high perceived life threat. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression may occur after ICU treatment. Early identification and appropriate intervention for PTSD are important for rehabilitation.",0
839,"PURPOSE: Survivors of critical illness may be at higher risk of developing subsequent mental illness. We sought to determine the risk of new mental illness diagnoses across a large population of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors compared with hospitalized patients. METHODS: Population-based study (2005-2015) conducted in adults hospitalized in Ontario, Canada. The primary exposure was ICU admission for ≥ 48 h; secondary exposures were ICU procedures including mechanical ventilation and duration of ICU. The primary outcome was mental illness diagnosed during the year after hospital discharge. To account for case mix differences between ICU and other hospitalized patients, sensitivity analyses were conducted restricting to six pre-specified diagnoses that can lead to hospitalization with or without ICU. RESULTS: 1,847,462 patients survived hospitalization, of whom 121,101 were admitted to ICU for ≥ 48 h. ICU patients had a higher rate of new mental illness diagnoses in the year after discharge compared to hospitalized patients (17 vs. 15%, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.08, 95% CI 1.07-1.10). In analyses restricted to pre-specified most responsible diagnoses, the increased risk associated with ICU was only significant for patients with pneumonia. Among ICU survivors, exposure to mechanical ventilation (aHR: 1.08; 95% CI 1.05-1.12) or longer ICU stays (aHR: 1.004 per day; 95% CI 1.003-1.005) increased the risk of new mental illness diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: ICU was associated with a marginally increased risk of mental illness diagnosis after hospitalization that was often no longer apparent when reason for admission was considered. Patients exposed to mechanical ventilation or longer ICU stays may be at higher risk of subsequent mental illnesses.",0
840,"This study aimed to examine the relationship between memory status of and factors related to patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) using a cross-sectional study design. Participants were adult patients who were admitted to the general ICUs for more than 48 hours. One week after ICU discharge, a survey on memory distortion was conducted. Overall, 133 patients were included, of whom 51.1% reported distorted memories. Among them, 15.0% had memory loss; 48.1% had unrealistic experiences; 27.8% recalled confusion, panic, anxiety, and discomfort during their ICU stay; and 9% had traumatic experiences. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that memory loss was associated with an operation, and a significant association was observed between traumatic memory and pain. Opioid use may have a protective effect against memory loss. These results suggest the importance of relieving pain and preserving true memories during ICU treatment.",0
841,"BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms following intensive care unit (ICU) treatment can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder and represent a severe health burden. In trauma patients, a strong sense of coherence (SOC) is associated with fewer PTS symptoms. However, this association has not been investigated in a general ICU sample. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the occurrence of PTS symptoms in general ICU patients early after ICU discharge and to assess possible associations between PTS symptoms and SOC, ICU memory, pain, and demographic and clinical characteristics. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. METHODS: Adult patients aged ≥18 years admitted for ≥24 hours to five ICUs between 2014 and 2016 were recruited. PTS symptoms and SOC were measured at the ward within the first week after discharge from the ICU using the Posttraumatic Stress Scale-10 and Sense of Coherence Scale-13. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify associations between PTS symptoms and SOC and the selected independent variables. RESULTS: A total of 523 patients were included (17.8% trauma patients; median age 57 years [range 18-94]; 53.3% male). The prevalence of clinically significant PTS symptoms was 32%. After adjustments for gender and age, lower SOC (P < 0.001), more ICU delusional memories (P < 0.001), greater pain interference (P < 0.001), not being a trauma patient (P = 0.02), and younger age (P = 0.03) were significantly associated with more PTS symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: One third of patients experienced clinically relevant PTS symptoms early after discharge from the ICU. In the present study, SOC, delusional memory, pain interference, younger age, and not being a trauma patient were factors associated with more PTS symptoms. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Early individual follow up after ICU discharge focusing on pain relief and delusional memory may reduce PTS symptoms, with a potential of improving rehabilitation.",0
842,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the epidemiology of and postintensive care unit (ICU) interventions for anxiety symptoms after critical illness. METHODS: We searched five databases (1970-2015) to identify studies assessing anxiety symptoms in adult ICU survivors. Data from studies using the most common assessment instrument were meta-analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 27 studies (2880 patients) among 27,334 citations. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A) subscale was the most common instrument (81% of studies). We pooled data at 2-3, 6 and 12-14month time-points, with anxiety symptom prevalences [HADS-A≥8, 95% confidence interval (CI)] of 32%(27-38%), 40%(33-46%) and 34%(25-42%), respectively. In a subset of studies with repeated assessments in the exact same patients, there was no significant change in anxiety score or prevalence over time. Age, gender, severity of illness, diagnosis and length of stay were not associated with anxiety symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms during admission and memories of in-ICU delusional experiences were potential risk factors. Physical rehabilitation and ICU diaries had potential benefit. CONCLUSIONS: One third of ICU survivors experience anxiety symptoms that are persistent during their first year of recovery. Psychiatric symptoms during admission and memories of in-ICU delusional experiences were associated with post-ICU anxiety. Physical rehabilitation and ICU diaries merit further investigation as possible interventions.",0
843,"BACKGROUND: As more patients are surviving intensive care, mental health concerns in survivors have become a research priority. Among these, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can have an important impact on the quality of life of critical care survivors. However, data on its burden are conflicting. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in adult critical care patients after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, PsycNET, and Scopus databases from inception to September 2018. We included observational studies assessing the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in adult critical care survivors. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Studies were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model to estimate PTSD symptom prevalence at different time points, also estimating confidence and prediction intervals. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool and the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Of 13,267 studies retrieved, 48 were included in this review. Overall prevalence of PTSD symptoms was 19.83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.72-23.13; I2 = 90%, low quality of evidence). Prevalence varied widely across studies, with a wide range of expected prevalence (from 3.70 to 43.73% in 95% of settings). Point prevalence estimates were 15.93% (95% CI, 11.15-21.35; I2 = 90%; 17 studies), 16.80% (95% CI, 13.74-20.09; I2 = 66%; 13 studies), 18.96% (95% CI, 14.28-24.12; I2 = 92%; 13 studies), and 20.21% (95% CI, 13.79-27.44; I2 = 58%; 7 studies) at 3, 6, 12, and > 12 months after discharge, respectively. CONCLUSION: PTSD symptoms may affect 1 in every 5 adult critical care survivors, with a high expected prevalence 12 months after discharge. ICU survivors should be screened for PTSD symptoms and cared for accordingly, given the potential negative impact of PTSD on quality of life. In addition, action should be taken to further explore the causal relationship between ICU stay and PTSD, as well as to propose early measures to prevent PTSD in this population.

844,"OBJECTIVES: To synthesize data on prevalence, natural history, risk factors, and post-ICU interventions for depressive symptoms in ICU survivors. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry (1970-2015). STUDY SELECTION: Studies measuring depression after hospital discharge using a validated instrument in more than 20 adults from non-specialty ICUs. DATA EXTRACTION: Duplicate independent review and data abstraction. DATA SYNTHESIS: The search identified 27,334 titles, with 42 eligible articles on 38 unique studies (n = 4,113). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression subscale was used most commonly (58%). The pooled Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression subscale prevalence (95% CI) of depressive symptoms at a threshold score greater than or equal to 8 was 29% (22-36%) at 2-3 months (12 studies; n = 1,078), 34% (24-43%) at 6 months (seven studies; n = 760), and 29% (23-34%) at 12-14 months (six studies; n = 1,041). The prevalence of suprathreshold depressive symptoms (compatible with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression subscale, ≥ 8) across all studies, using all instruments, was between 29% and 30% at all three time points. The pooled change in prevalence (95% CI) from 2-3 to 6 months (four studies; n = 387) was 5% (-1% to +12%), and from 6 to 12 months (three studies; n = 412) was 1% (-6% to +7%). Risk factors included pre-ICU psychologic morbidity and presence of in-ICU psychologic distress symptoms. We did not identify any post-ICU intervention with strong evidence of improvement in depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically important depressive symptoms occurred in approximately one-third of ICU survivors and were persistent through 12-month follow-up. Greater research into treatment is needed for this common and persistent post-ICU morbidity.",0
845,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and metaanalysis of the prevalence, risk factors, and prevention/treatment strategies for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in critical illness survivors. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library from inception through March 5, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies met the following criteria: 1) adult general/nonspecialty ICU, 2) validated posttraumatic stress disorder instrument greater than or equal to 1 month post-ICU, and 3) sample size greater than or equal to 10 patients. DATA EXTRACTION: Duplicate independent review and data abstraction from all eligible titles/abstracts/full-text articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: The search identified 2,817 titles/abstracts, with 40 eligible articles on 36 unique cohorts (n = 4,260 patients). The Impact of Event Scale was the most common posttraumatic stress disorder instrument. Between 1 and 6 months post-ICU (six studies; n = 456), the pooled mean (95% CI) Impact of Event Scale score was 20 (17-24), and the pooled prevalences of clinically important posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (95% CI) were 25% (18-34%) and 44% (36-52%) using Impact of Event Scale thresholds greater than or equal to 35 and greater than or equal to 20, respectively. Between 7 and 12 months post-ICU (five studies; n = 698), the pooled mean Impact of Event Scale score was 17 (9-24), and pooled prevalences of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were 17% (10-26%) and 34% (22-50%), respectively. ICU risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms included benzodiazepine administration and post-ICU memories of frightening ICU experiences. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were associated with worse quality of life. In European-based studies: 1) an ICU diary was associated with a significant reduction in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, 2) a self-help rehabilitation manual was associated with significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptom reduction at 2 months, but not 6 months; and 3) a nurse-led ICU follow-up clinic did not reduce posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically important posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms occurred in one fifth of critical illness survivors at 1-year follow-up, with higher prevalence in those who had comorbid psychopathology, received benzodiazepines, and had early memories of frightening ICU experiences. In European studies, ICU diaries reduced posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.",0
846,"Current achievements in medical science and technological advancements in intensive care medicine have allowed better support of critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and have increased survival probability. Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is a relatively new term introduced almost 10 years ago, defined as “new or worsening impairments in physical, cognitive, or mental health status arising after critical illness and persisting beyond acute care hospitalization”. A significant percentage of critically ill patients suffer from PICS for a prolonged period of time, with physical problems being the most common. The exact prevalence of PICS is unknown, and many risk factors have been described well. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors seem to be at especially high risk for developing PICS. The families of ICU survivors can also be affected as a response to the stress suffered during the critical illness of their kin. This separate entity is described as PICS family (PICS-F). A multidisciplinary approach is warranted for the treatment of PICS, involving healthcare professionals, clinicians, and scientists from different areas. Improving outcomes is both challenging and imperative for the critical care community. The review of the relevant literature and the study of the physical, cognitive, and mental sequelae could lead to the prevention and timely management of PICS and the subsequent improvement of the quality of life for ICU survivors.",0
847,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors experience a high prevalence of cognitive impairment with concomitantly impaired functional status and quality of life, often persisting months after hospital discharge. In this review, we explore the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment following ARDS, the interrelations between mechanisms and risk factors, and interventions that may mitigate the risk of cognitive impairment. Risk factors for cognitive decline following ARDS include pre-existing cognitive impairment, neurological injury, delirium, mechanical ventilation, prolonged exposure to sedating medications, sepsis, systemic inflammation, and environmental factors in the intensive care unit, which can co-occur synergistically in various combinations. Detection and characterization of pre-existing cognitive impairment imparts challenges in clinical management and longitudinal outcome study enrollment. Patients with brain injury who experience ARDS constitute a distinct population with a particular combination of risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms: considerations raised by brain injury include neurogenic pulmonary edema, differences in sympathetic activation and cholinergic transmission, effects of positive end-expiratory pressure on cerebral microcirculation and intracranial pressure, and sensitivity to vasopressor use and volume status. The blood-brain barrier represents a physiological interface at which multiple mechanisms of cognitive impairment interact, as acute blood-brain barrier weakening from mechanical ventilation and systemic inflammation can compound existing chronic blood-brain barrier dysfunction from Alzheimer’s-type pathophysiology, rendering the brain vulnerable to both amyloid-beta accumulation and cytokine-mediated hippocampal damage. Although some contributory elements, such as the presenting brain injury or pre-existing cognitive impairment, may be irreversible, interventions such as minimizing mechanical ventilation tidal volume, minimizing duration of exposure to sedating medications, maintaining hemodynamic stability, optimizing fluid balance, and implementing bundles to enhance patient care help dramatically to reduce duration of delirium and may help prevent acquisition of long-term cognitive impairment.",0
848,"The authors enrolled 277 subjects with acute respiratory failure to describe the epidemiology of depressive disorders and antidepressant use during and after intensive care. By SCID criteria, the prevalence of major depressive episode at 2 months was 16%, and 16% had depressive disorder not otherwise specified. Mood disorder incidence was 25% or 28%, depending on methodology. Pre-ICU physical functioning and depression were associated with 2- and 6-month depression severity. At 2 months, the prevalence of antidepressant medication use was 49%, and the incidence was 28%. Depression and antidepressant pharmacotherapy are frequent during recovery from acute respiratory failure.",0
849,"Negative emotional outcomes (anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress) have been identified in patients discharged from intensive care. The aims of this prospective, longitudinal study were to assess levels of and changes in emotional outcome after intensive care, and to explore how these relate to objective and subjective indicators of the intensive care experience. Emotional outcome was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression and Impact of Event Scales. Anxiety (p = 0.046) and depression (p = 0.001) were reduced subsequently, but not avoidance (p = 0.340) or intrusion (p = 0.419). Most objective (age, gender, length of ICU and hospital stay) and subjective indicators (as measured by the Intensive Care Experience Questionnaire) of the intensive care experience were related to negative emotional outcome. Subjective interpretation of the intensive care experience emerged as a consistent predictor of adverse emotional outcome, in both the short- and the long-term.",0
850,"OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively the relationship between memories of intensive care (ICU) and levels of anxiety after ICU discharge, the stability of these memories with time, and their relationship to the development of acute posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms. DESIGN: Case series cohort assessed by interview at 2 and 8 wks after ICU discharge. SETTING: District general hospital (serving a population of 350,000) general intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Memories of ICU and anxiety levels were studied in 45 patients after ICU discharge. Thirty patients were examined again at 8 wks to assess memory stability and development of acute PTSD-related symptoms. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Standardized interviews and questionnaires were used to assess memory for ICU, anxiety, and depression 2 wks after ICU discharge. In addition, PTSD-related symptoms and panic were assessed 8 wks after ICU discharge. A total of 33 of 45 patients had delusional memories from ICU at 2 wks; nine of the patients with delusional memories had no factual memories, and these patients had higher anxiety levels 2 wks after ICU discharge (p < .0001). Thirty patients had paired assessments at 2 and 8 wks. Those patients who had no factual recall of ICU but had delusional memories at 2 wks scored highly for PTSD-related symptoms and panic attacks at 8 wks (p = .023 and .014, respectively). The only predictors of possible acute PTSD-related symptoms at the 8-wk assessment were trait anxiety (p = .006) and having delusional memories without recall of factual events in the ICU at 2 wks (p < .0001). Only delusional memories were retained over time, whereas the recall of factual events in the ICU declined. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the development of acute PTSD-related symptoms may be related more to recall of delusions alone. This study suggests that even relatively unpleasant memories for real events during critical illness may give some protection from anxiety and the later development of PTSD-related symptoms when memories of delusions are prominent.",0
851,"AIM: To investigate patients' psychological distress in relation to memory and stressful experiences in the intensive care unit (ICU), and to identify early predictors for the development of high levels of acute post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed over 18 months in two general ICUs, including 313 intubated mechanically ventilated adults admitted for more than 24 h, 226 of whom completed the study. Patients were interviewed 5 days and 2 months post-ICU concerning their memories and psychological distress. The instruments used were the ICU Memory Tool, ICU Stressful Experience Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS: High symptom levels of anxiety, depression and acute PTSD 2 months post-ICU were present in 4.9%, 7.5% and 8.4% of the 226 patients, respectively. Psychological distress 2 months post-ICU was associated with experiences of the ICU rated as extremely stressful and with high levels of anxiety and depression 5 days post-ICU, but not with amnesia or delusional memories without factual recall of the ICU. Female sex, signs of agitation (increasing proportion of Motor Activity Assessment Scale scores of 4-6) and feelings of extreme fear during the ICU stay were significantly and independently associated with IES-R scores of 30 or more. CONCLUSIONS: Extremely stressful experiences of the ICU are associated with subsequent psychological distress. Female sex, agitation and extreme fear during the ICU stay seem to increase the risk of developing high levels of acute PTSD-related symptoms.",0
852,"Introduction There is growing evidence of poor mental health and quality of life among survivors of intensive care. However, it is not yet clear to what extent the trauma of life-threatening illness, associated drugs and treatments, or patients' psychological reactions during intensive care contribute to poor psychosocial outcomes. Our aim was to investigate the relative contributions of a broader set of risk factors and outcomes than had previously been considered in a single study. Methods A prospective cohort study of 157 mixed-diagnosis highest acuity patients was conducted in a large general intensive care unit (ICU). Data on four groups of risk factors (clinical, acute psychological, socio-demographic and chronic health) were collected during ICU admissions. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and quality of life were assessed using validated questionnaires at three months (n =100). Multivariable analysis was used. Results At follow-up, 55% of patients had psychological morbidity: 27.1% (95% CI: 18.3%, 35.9%) had probable PTSD; 46.3% (95% CI: 36.5%, 56.1%) probable depression, and 44.4% (95% CI: 34.6%, 54.2%) anxiety. The strongest clinical risk factor for PTSD was longer duration of sedation (regression coefficient = 0.69 points (95% CI: 0.12, 1.27) per day, scale = 0 to 51). There was a strong association between depression at three months and receiving benzodiazepines in the ICU (mean difference between groups = 6.73 points (95% CI: 1.42, 12.06), scale = 0 to 60). Use of inotropes or vasopressors was correlated with anxiety, and corticosteroids with better physical quality of life., The effects of these clinical risk factors on outcomes were mediated (partially explained) by acute psychological reactions in the ICU. In fully adjusted models, the strongest independent risk factors for PTSD were mood in ICU, intrusive memories in ICU and psychological history. ICU mood, psychological history and socio-economic position were the strongest risk factors for depression. Conclusions Strikingly high rates of psychological morbidity were found in this cohort of intensive care survivors. The study's key finding was that acute psychological reactions in the ICU were the strongest modifiable risk factors for developing mental illness in the future. The observation that use of different ICU drugs correlated with different psychological outcomes merits further investigation. These findings suggest that psychological interventions, along with pharmacological modifications, could help reduce poor outcomes, including PTSD, after intensive care.",0
853,"OBJECTIVE: To assess self-reported symptom burden of chronic critical illness. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Respiratory care unit for treatment of chronically critically ill patients at an academic, tertiary-care, urban medical center. PATIENTS: Fifty patients who underwent elective tracheotomy and transfer from an adult intensive care unit to the respiratory care unit for weaning from mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: Assessment of physical and psychological symptoms through patients' self-reports using a modification of the Condensed Form of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured self-reported symptom burden, ventilator outcomes, and vital status and functional status at discharge and 3 and 6 months after discharge. Half of the patients were successfully liberated from mechanical ventilation, but most hospital survivors were discharged to skilled nursing facilities and more than half of the cohort was dead at 3 months after discharge. Seventy-two percent (36 of 50) of patients were able to self-report symptoms during the period of respiratory care unit treatment. Among patients responding to symptom assessment, approximately 90% were symptomatic. Forty-four percent of patients reported pain at the highest levels. More than 60% reported psychological symptoms at these levels, and approximately 90% of patients reported severe distress due to difficulty communicating. CONCLUSIONS: Physical and psychological symptom distress is common and severe among patients receiving treatment for chronic critical illness. The majority of these patients die soon after hospital discharge. Given the level of distress in our study patients and the high mortality rate that we and others have observed, greater attention should be given to relief of pain and other distressing symptoms and to assessment of burdens and benefits of treatment for the chronically critically ill.",0
854,"OBJECTIVE: To study the physical and psychological stressors in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to correlate stressors with different demographic variables. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analytical survey. SETTING: Intensive care unit of a private hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: 50 randomly selected ICU patients during the first week of their ICU stay. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The Intensive Care Unit Environmental Stressor Scale was administered to 50 patients. Pain and the impossibility of sleeping due to noise and having tubes in the nose and mouth were considered the most important physical stressors. Loss of self control and lack of understanding about the attitudes and procedures were the main psychological stressors. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions should be aimed at relieving the patient's pain and at controlling the level of noise to make sleep possible. From the psychological standpoint, the independence of the patient should be encouraged, thus stimulating the recovery of self-control. The team should also inform the patient about the procedures which will be carried out.",0

PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-one intensive care unit patients at high risk of dying. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were interviewed every other day for up to 14 days. Patients rated the presence, intensity (1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe), and distress (1 = not very distressing; 2 = moderately distressing; 3 = very distressing) of ten symptoms (that is, pain, tired, short of breath, restless, anxious, sad, hungry, scared, thirsty, confused). The Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit was used to ascertain the presence of delirium. A total of 405 symptom assessments were completed by 171 patients. Patients' average age was 58 ± 15 yrs; 64% were males. Patients were mechanically ventilated during 34% of the 405 assessments, and 22% died in the hospital. Symptom prevalence ranged from 75% (tired) to 27% (confused). Thirst was moderately intense, and shortness of breath, scared, confusion, and pain were moderately distressful. Delirium was found in 34.2% of the 152 patients who could be evaluated. Delirious patients were more acutely ill and received significantly higher doses of opioids. Delirious patients were significantly more likely to report feeling confused (43% vs. 22%, p = .004) and sad (46% vs. 31%, p = .04) and less likely to report being tired (57% vs. 77%, p = .006) than nondelirious patients. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that unrelieved and distressing symptoms are present for the majority of intensive care unit patients, including those with delirium. Symptom assessment in high-risk intensive care unit patients may lead to more focused interventions to avoid or minimize unnecessary suffering.",0
856,"The intensive care unit syndrome (ICU syndrome) is defined as an altered emotional state occurring in a highly stressful environment, which may manifest itself in various forms such as delirium, confusion, crazy dreams or unreal experiences. The purpose of this part of a study of patients' experiences is to describe and illuminate patients' experiences of acute confusion, disorientation, wakefulness, dreams and nightmares during and after their stay in the ICU. The data were obtained from 19 ventilated patients, who were interviewed twice and had stayed at least 36 hours in the ICU, the first interview being about one week after discharge from the ICU, and the second 4-8 weeks later. The hermeneutic approach used when interpreting and analysing the text from the interviews revealed that patients' experiences of unreal experiences were often associated with intense fear. Intense or continuous unbearable fear seems to result in frightening unreal experiences, which further increase the level of fear. Care actions or caring relationships with relatives or nurses can reduce this fear, which can help to prevent the occurrence and/or duration and intensity of the unreal experiences. Trust and confidence in nurses or significant others and feelings of self-control or trust in self-control seemed to reduce the risk of unreal experiences so that adverse stimuli might only trigger a mild confusion.",0
857,"Depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are common, long-lasting and associated with worse quality of life among intensive care unit (ICU) survivors.1–4 There are few clinical trials evaluating interventions to improve these symptoms. Cox and colleagues evaluated the feasibility of a mobile mindfulness training application (App) to address psychological stress after critical illness.5 Mindfulness promotes non-judgmental awareness of the present and acceptance of emotions, thoughts (eg, ‘I’m broken’, ‘I’m dependent’) and physiological states (eg, pain, shortness of breath), thus improving engagement with thoughts and behaviours related to illness along with coping and medical management of disease.6  This multisite pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) randomised 80 participants to one of the three groups: mobile App, telephone mindfulness training or education control. Eligibility criteria included adults in the ICU ≥24 hours with cardiorespiratory failure. Participants randomised to mobile mindfulness intervention interacted with the App over 4 weekly mindfulness training sessions. Participants in the telephone group completed 4 weekly telephone mindfulness sessions (~30 min each) with a trained psychologist. The education control group received two telephone calls and a self-directed web-based programme focused on the nature and treatment of critical illness. Primary outcomes included feasibility, acceptability and usability. Secondary outcomes included depressive, anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Approximately 83% (n=66) of patients completed the study. Loss to follow-up was 29%, 10% and 11% in the mobile mindfulness, telephone mindfulness and education groups, respectively. The percentage of participants who were not lost to follow-up completing all intervention sessions was ≥92% in each group. The results demonstrated ‘strong’ acceptability and usability with qualitative feedback considered overall ‘positive’ regarding the App. At 3-month follow-up, preliminary data demonstrated no significant improvement from baseline (before hospital discharge) in anxiety and depressive symptoms in the education control group while there was a trend toward improvements in these symptoms in the mobile and …",0
858,"Objective Post-intensive care syndrome is a term used to describe new or worsening multidimensional impairments in physical, psychological cognitive and social status arising from critical illness and persisting beyond hospital discharge. It is associated with high morbidity among patients discharged from intensive care units. However, due to its complexities, which encompass physical, psychological, cognitive and social impairments, the exact nature of this condition has not been fully conceptualized. The aim of this analysis therefore was to define the concept of post-intensive care syndrome. This conceptual clarity provides a general definition that is essential for practitioners and researchers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the syndrome and provide for accurate measurement of its incidence and prevalence. Design The Walker and Avant approach to concept analysis guided this investigation. Data source An electronic search of the literature using PubMed, CINHAL, PsycArticles, Academic search complete, Science Direct, MEDLINE and Health Source databases informed the analysis. The search included both quantitative and qualitative studies related to post-intensive care syndrome published in English between 2010 and 2020. Results Of the 3948 articles identified, 24 ultimately met the inclusion criteria. Analysis identified the defining attributes of post-intensive care syndrome as: (1) new or worsening multidimensional impairments; (2) physical dysfunction; (3) psychological disorder; (4) cognitive impairment; (5) failed social reconstruction; and (6) persistent impaired multidimensional symptoms extending beyond intensive care and hospital discharge. Antecedents were divided into two categories: pre-existing and those related to the intensive care admission. Consequences were identified as both positive (for example the establishment of coping processes) and adverse (for example decreased quality of life and caregiver burden). Conclusion Post-intensive care syndrome affects more than half of patients discharged from intensive care units. This operational definition and conceptual understanding of this syndrome will help improve understanding and inform the design of preventative strategies to improve long-term consequences of the syndrome. Future research and standardized instrument development will serve to better understand the scope and characteristics of this syndrome and inform the development of possible preventative interventions.",0
859,"BACKGROUND: Better understanding of patient and family member experiences of delirium and related distress during critical care is required to inform the development of targeted nonpharmacologic interventions. OBJECTIVE: To examine and synthesize qualitative data on patient and family member delirium experiences and relieving factors in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis. Eligible studies contained adult patient or family quotes about delirium during critical care, published in English in a peer-reviewed journal since 1980. Data sources included PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane and Clinicaltrials.gov. METHODS: Systematic searches yielded 3238 identified articles, of which 14 reporting 13 studies were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Qualitative meta-synthesis was performed through line-by-line coding of relevant quotes, organization of codes into descriptive themes, and development of analytical themes. Five patients/family members with experience of ICU delirium contributed to the thematic analysis. RESULTS: Qualitative meta-synthesis resulted in four major themes and two sub-themes. Key new patient and family-centric insights regarding delirium-related distress in the ICU included articulation of the distinct emotions experienced during and after delirium (for patients, predominantly fear, anger and shame); its 'whole-person' nature; and the value that patients and family members placed on clinicians' compassion, communication, and connectedness. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct difficult emotions and other forms of distress are experienced by patients and families during ICU delirium, during which patients and families highly value human kindness and empathy. Future studies should further explore and address the many facets of delirium-related distress during critical care using these insights and include patient-reported measures of the predominant difficult emotions.",0
860,"OBJECTIVES: Patients' experience of psychological distress in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with adverse effects, reduced satisfaction, and delayed physical and psychological recovery. There are no specific guidelines for the assessment and management of acute psychological distress during hospitalisation in the ICU. We reviewed existing tools for the assessment of acute psychological distress in ICU patients, examined evidence on their metric properties, and identified potential gaps and methodological considerations. METHOD: A scoping review based on literature searches (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica Database, PsycINFO, Scopus, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, Dissertations and Theses Global, and Google Scholar) and predefined eligibility criteria was conducted as per current scoping review guidelines. FINDINGS: Overall, 14 assessment tools were identified having been developed in diverse ICU settings. The identified tools assess mainly anxiety and depressive symptoms and ICU stressors, and investigators have reported various validity and reliability metrics. It was unclear whether available tools can be used in specific groups, such as noncommunicative patients and patients with delirium, brain trauma, stroke, sedation, and cognitive impairments. CONCLUSION: Available tools have methodological limitations worth considering in future investigations. Given the high prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in ICU survivors, rigorously exploring the metric integrity of available tools used for anxiety, depressive, and psychological distress symptom assessment in the vulnerable ICU population is a practice and research priority. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: These results have implications for the selection and implementation of psychological distress assessment methods as a means for promoting meaningful patient-centred clinical outcomes and humanising ICU care experiences.",0
862,"BACKGROUND: Patients may suffer extreme psychological reactions in intensive care units (ICU), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after leaving hospital. Previous systematic reviews of studies up to 2007 found that the true prevalence of and consistent risk factors for PTSD after ICU were not established, due to methodological shortcomings of studies. Therefore we aimed to conduct a systematic review of observational studies of post-ICU PTSD from 2008-2012, and to compare them to 1997-2007 studies, with regard to quality, prevalence estimates and risk factors. METHODS: We used a pre-specified protocol, and systematic, explicit methods to identify, select and critically appraise studies. Studies in general ICU settings with mixed-diagnosis patients (N.>30) were included. Risk of bias was assessed, with lower-risk studies given greater weight. No quantitative synthesis was possible due to heterogeneity, therefore ranges of estimates and frequencies of risk factors were examined. RESULTS: The review included 26 papers, 13 from 1997-2007 and 13 from 2008-2012. There were more high quality studies in the latter period. The range of prevalence estimates from high-quality studies was similar; 8% to 27% (1997-2007) and 9% to 27% (2008-2012). Clinical risk factors consistently identified over the two periods were use of benzodiazepines, duration of sedation and mechanical ventilation. Psychological risk factors include stress and fear experienced acutely in ICU, and frightening memories of the admission. CONCLUSION: The quality and number of post-ICU PTSD studies has increased over time, and we can be more confident in the accumulated findings. Evidence from both periods suggests that up to 27% of ICU survivors suffer from PTSD. There is also increasing evidence that use of benzodiazepines and duration of sedation, along with fear, stress and delirium in the ICU are likely risk factors for subsequent PTSD.",0
863,"Delirium is an acute and usually transient severe neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with significant long-term physical morbidity. However, its chronic psychiatric sequelae remain poorly characterized. To investigate the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, namely anxiety, depressive, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms after delirium, a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases was performed independently by two authors in March 2016. Bibliographies were hand-searched, and a forward- and backward-citation search using Web of Science was performed for all included studies. Of 6411 titles, we included eight prospective cohort studies, including 370 patients with delirium and 1073 without delirium. Studies were heterogeneous and mostly included older people from a range of clinical groups. Consideration of confounders was variable. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was almost three times higher in patients with delirium than in patients without delirium (22.2% vs 8.0%, risk ratio = 2.79; 95% confidence interval = 1.36-5.73). There was no statistically significant difference between the prevalence of anxiety symptoms between patients with and without delirium. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms after delirium was inconclusive: only one study investigated this and no association between PTSD symptoms after delirium was reported. There is limited published evidence of the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms after non-ICU delirium and the strongest evidence is for depressive symptoms. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and PTSD symptoms.",0
864,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the relation between delirium in critically ill patients and their outcomes in the short term (in the intensive care unit and in hospital) and after discharge from hospital. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PsychINFO, with no language restrictions, up to 1 January 2015. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTION STUDIES: Reports were eligible for inclusion if they were prospective observational cohorts or clinical trials of adults in intensive care units who were assessed with a validated delirium screening or rating system, and if the association was measured between delirium and at least one of four clinical endpoints (death during admission, length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and any outcome after hospital discharge). Studies were excluded if they primarily enrolled patients with a neurological disorder or patients admitted to intensive care after cardiac surgery or organ/tissue transplantation, or centered on sedation management or alcohol or substance withdrawal. Data were extracted on characteristics of studies, populations sampled, identification of delirium, and outcomes. Random effects models and meta-regression analyses were used to pool data from individual studies. RESULTS: Delirium was identified in 5280 of 16,595 (31.8%) critically ill patients reported in 42 studies. When compared with control patients without delirium, patients with delirium had significantly higher mortality during admission (risk ratio 2.19, 94% confidence interval 1.78 to 2.70; P<0.001) as well as longer durations of mechanical ventilation and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and in hospital (standard mean differences 1.79 (95% confidence interval 0.31 to 3.27; P<0.001), 1.38 (0.99 to 1.77; P<0.001), and 0.97 (0.61 to 1.33; P<0.001), respectively). Available studies indicated an association between delirium and cognitive impairment after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly a third of patients admitted to an intensive care unit develop delirium, and these patients are at increased risk of dying during admission, longer stays in hospital, and cognitive impairment after discharge.",0
865,"Objective The diagnosis of delirium depends on eliciting its features through mental status examination and informant history. However, there is marked heterogeneity in how these features are assessed, from binary subjective clinical judgement to more comprehensive methods supported by cognitive testing. The aim of this article is to review the neuropsychological research in delirium and suggest future directions in research and clinical practice. Methods We reviewed the neuropsychological literature on formal assessment and quantification of the different domains in delirium, focusing on the core feature of inattention. Results Few studies have characterised and quantified the features of delirium using objective methods commonly employed in neuropsychological research. The existing evidence confirms that patients with delirium usually show impairments on objective tests of attention compared with cognitively intact controls and, in most cases, compared with patients with dementia. Further, abnormal level of arousal appears to be a specific indicator of delirium. The neuropsychological evidence base for impairments in other cognitive domains in delirium, including visual perception, language and thought processes, is small. Conclusions Delirium diagnosis requires accurate testing for its features, but there is little neuropsychological research examining the nature of these features, or evaluating the reliability, validity and discriminatory power of existing assessment processes. More research using the neuropsychological approach has enormous potential to improve and standardise delirium assessment methods of the individual features of delirium, such as inattention, and in developing more robust reference standards to enable greater comparability between studies.",0
866,"Background: The ABCDE (Awakening and Breathing Coordination of daily sedation and ventilator removal trials, Delirium monitoring and management, and Early mobility and exercise) and ABCDEF (Assessment, prevent and manage pain, Both spontaneous awakening and spontaneous breathing trials, Choice of analgesia and sedation, assess, prevent and manage Delirium, Early mobility and exercise, Family engagement) care bundles consist of small sets of evidence-based interventions and are part of the science behind Intensive Care Unit (ICU) liberation. This review sought to analyse the process of implementation of ABCDE and ABCDEF care bundles in ICUs, identifying barriers, facilitators and changes in perception and attitudes of healthcare professionals; and to estimate care bundle effectiveness and safety. Methods: We selected qualitative and quantitative studies addressing the implementation of ABCDE and ABCDEF bundles in the ICU, identified on MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Epistemonikos, PsycINFO, Virtual Health Library and Open Grey, without restriction on language or date of publication, up to June 2018. The outcomes measured were ICU and hospital length of stay; mechanical ventilation time; incidence and prevalence of delirium or coma; level of agitation and sedation; early mobilization; mortality in ICU and hospital; change in perception, attitude or behaviour of the stakeholders; and change in knowledge of health professionals. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias and methodological quality. A meta-analysis of random effects was performed. Results: Twenty studies were included, 13 of which had a predominantly qualitative and 7 a quantitative design (31,604 participants). The implementation strategies were categorized according to the taxonomy developed by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Group and eighty strategies were identified. The meta-analysis results showed that implementation of the bundles may reduce length of ICU stay, mechanical ventilation time, delirium, ICU and hospital mortality, and promoted early mobilization in critically-ill patients. Conclusions : This study can contribute to the planning and execution of the implementation process of ABCDE and ABCDEF care bundles in ICUs. However, the effectiveness and safety of these bundles need to be corroborated by further studies with greater methodological rigor. Protocol registration: PROSPERO CRD42019121307.",0
867,"Background There is currently no reliable way to choose strategies that are appropriate for implementing guidelines facing different barriers. This study examined trends in guideline implementation by topic over a 10-year period to explore whether and how strategies may be suitable for addressing differing barriers. Methods A scoping systematic review was performed. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 2004 to 2013 for studies that evaluated the implementation of guidelines on arthritis, diabetes, colorectal cancer and heart failure. Data on study characteristics, reason for implementation (new guideline or quality improvement), implementation strategy used, rationale for selecting that strategy and reported impact were extracted and summarized. Interventions were mapped against a published taxonomy of guideline implementation strategies. Results The search resulted in 1,709 articles; 156 were retrieved and 127 were excluded largely because they did not evaluate guideline implementation, leaving 32 eligible for review (4 arthritis, 3 colorectal cancer, 21 diabetes, 4 heart failure). Six of 7 randomized trials and 8 of 25 observational studies had a low risk of bias. Most studies promoted guideline use for quality improvement (78.0%). Few studies rationalized strategy choice (18.8%). Most employed multiple approaches and strategies, most often educational meetings and print material for professionals or patients. Few studies employed organizational, financial or regulatory approaches. Strategies employed that were unique to the published taxonomy included professional (print material, tailoring guidelines, self-audit training or material) and patient strategies (education, counselling, group interaction, print material, reminders). Most studies achieved positive impact (87.5%). This did not appear to be associated with guideline topic, use of theory or barrier assessment, or number or type of implementation approaches and strategies. Conclusions While few studies were eligible, limiting insight on how to choose implementation strategies that address guideline-specific barriers, this review identified other important findings. Education for professionals or patients and print material were the most commonly employed strategies for translating guidelines to practice. Mapping of strategies onto the published taxonomy identified gaps in guideline implementation that represent opportunities for future research and expanded the taxonomy.

868,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of ICU diaries on posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in ICU survivors and their relatives. Secondary objectives were to determine the effect on anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life in patients and their relatives. DATA SOURCES: We searched online databases, trial registries, and references of relevant articles. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if there was an ICU diary intervention group which was compared with a group without a diary. DATA EXTRACTION: Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles were reviewed independently by two authors. Data was abstracted using a structured template. DATA SYNTHESIS: Our search identified 1,790 articles and retained eight studies for inclusion in the analysis. Pooled results found no significant reduction in patients' posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms with ICU diaries (risk ratio, 0.75 [0.3-1.73]; p = 0.5; n = 3 studies); however, there was a significant improvement in patients' anxiety (risk ratio, 0.32 [0.12, 0.86]; p = 0.02; n = 2 studies) and depression (risk ratio, 0.39 [0.17-0.87]; p = 0.02; n = 2 studies) symptoms. Two studies reported significant improvement in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms of relatives of ICU survivors; however, these results could not be pooled due to reporting differences. One study reported no significant improvement in either anxiety (risk ratio, 0.94; 95% [0.66-1.33]; p = 0.72) or depression (risk ratio, 0.98; 95% [0.5-1.9]; p = 0.95) in relatives. There was a significant improvement in health-related quality of life of patients with a mean increase in the Short Form-36 general health score by 11.46 (95% CI, 5.87-17.05; p ≤ 0.0001; n = 2 studies). No studies addressed health-related quality of life of relatives. CONCLUSIONS: ICU diaries decrease anxiety and depression and improve health-related quality of life, but not posttraumatic stress disorder among ICU survivors and may result in less posttraumatic stress disorder among relatives of ICU patients. Multicenter trials with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm these findings.",0
869,"BACKGROUND: Memory gaps in intensive care unit (ICU) survivors are associated with psychiatric disorders. The ICU diaries improve the patient's factual memory of the ICU, but it is not clear if they reduce the incidence of psychiatric disorders in patients and relatives after hospital discharge. The aim of this study is to evaluate the literature on the effect of ICU diaries for patients admitted in ICU and their relatives. METHODS: Two authors independently searched the online databases PubMed, OVID, Embase, EBSCO host, and PsycINFO from inception to July 2019. Studies were included if the intervention group (ICU diary) was compared with a group with no diaries and the sample was comprised patients ≥ 18 years old admitted in the ICU for more than 24 h and their relatives. Randomized clinical trials, observational studies, letter with original data, and abstracts were included, irrespective of the language. The search was not limited by any specific outcome. Review articles, commentaries, editorials, and studies without a control group were excluded. Structured tools were used to assess the methodological quality (""Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I)"" for cohort studies and the ""Cochrane Risk of Bias tool"" for included RCTs and before/after studies). A random-effects model was employed considering the anticipated variability between the studies. RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty-five titles were identified for screening. Two additional studies were selected after a reference search, and after a full-text review, a total of 12 studies were included. When pooling the results, ICU diary was associated with lower risk of depression (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23-0.75) and better quality of life (10.3 points higher in SF-36 general health score, 95% CI 0.79-19.8), without a decrease in anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For the relatives receiving an ICU diary, there was no difference in the incidence of PTSD, anxiety, or depression. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis supports the use of ICU diaries to reduce the risk of depression and preserve the quality of life of patients after ICU admission. ICU diaries do not seem to have any beneficial effect on the relatives of the patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO, CRD42019136639.",0
870,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to summarize the current qualitative evidence on patients' experiences of reading the ICU diaries. DATA SOURCES: We searched the online databases PubMed, Ovid, EMBASE, and EBSCO host from inception to July 2020. STUDY SELECTION: All studies that presented any qualitative findings regarding patients' experiences of reading an ICU diary were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Study design, location, publication year, data collection method, and mode, all qualitative themes identified and reported, and participant quotations, when appropriate. We also extracted data regarding the diary structure, when available. A thematic synthesis approach was used to analyze and synthesize qualitative data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seventeen studies were analyzed. Most patients reported positive experiences with the ICU diary, such as understanding what they survived during critical illness, better understanding the process of recovery, gaining coherence of nightmares and delusional memories, realizing the importance of the presence of family and loved ones during ICU stay, and humanizing healthcare professionals that helped them survive critical illness. Patients also reported which components of the diary were important for their recovery, such as the presence of photographs and reading the diary with a healthcare professional, allowing the improvement of the concept of the ICU diary. CONCLUSION: This qualitative synthesis shows that patients recommend having an ICU diary, enlightening benefits such as better coping with the slow recovery from critical illness, strengthening family ties, and humanizing the ICU staff. It also identifies characteristics of the diary valued by the patients, in order to standardize the ICU diary according to their perspectives, and allowing future comparability between randomized controlled trials.",0
871,"PURPOSE: Although the intensive care unit (ICU) diary has been proposed as a tool for preventing psychiatric symptoms in survivors of critical illness, relatives and health care providers may benefit from it too. This study aims to summarize the current qualitative evidence on families' and health care professionals' experiences of writing in and reading the ICU diaries. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, OVID, Embase, and EBSCOhost from inception to February 2021, and included all the studies that presented any qualitative finding regarding relatives' and health care providers' experiences of writing in and reading an ICU diary. We used modified Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) and Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) for quality assessment. A thematic synthesis approach was used to analyze and synthesize the qualitative data. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were analyzed (15 including family members and 13 including health care professionals). For family members, the ICU diary is an important source of medical information, provides a way for them to register their presence at patient's bedside and express their feelings, and contributes to humanizing the ICU staff. This impression is shared by relatives of patients who did not survive critical illness. Health care providers believe the diary is beneficial for themselves and others; however, they are concerned with possible negative impressions from patients and family that could lead to judicial problems. They also remark on several obstacles they face when constructing the diaries (workload, creativity, and environment for writing), which can make it a distressful process. CONCLUSION: This qualitative synthesis shows that family members and health care professionals consider the ICU diary a valuable intervention. It also brings evidence to challenges faced during diary writing, which should be carefully approached in order to reduce the stress associated with this process.",0
872,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of an intensive care unit (ICU) diary versus no ICU diary on patients, and their caregivers or families, during the patient's recovery from admission to an ICU. DESIGN: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PILOT; Web of Science Conference Proceedings, clinical trial registries and reference lists of identified trials. REVIEW METHODS: Studies evaluated the effectiveness of patient diaries, when compared to no ICU diary, for patients or family members to promote recovery after admission to ICU were included. Outcome measures for describing recovery from ICU included the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptomatology, health-related quality of life and costs. We used standard methodological approaches as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently reviewed titles for inclusion, extracted data and undertook risk of bias according to pre-specified criteria. RESULTS: We identified three eligible studies; two describing ICU patients (N=358), and one describing relatives of ICU patients (N=30). No study adequately reported on risk of PTSD as described using a clinical interview, family or caregiver anxiety or depression, health-related quality of life or costs. Within a single study there was no clear evidence of a difference in risk for developing anxiety (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.07-1.19) or depression (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.12-1.19) in participants who received ICU diaries, in comparison to those that did not receive a patient diary. Within a single study there was no evidence of difference in median post-traumatic stress symptomatology scores (diaries 24, SD 11.6; no diary 24, SD 11.6) and delusional ICU memory recall (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84-1.28) between the patients recovering from ICU admission who received patient diaries, and those who did not. One study reported reduced post-traumatic stress symptomatology in family members of patients recovering from admission to ICU who received patient diaries (median 19; range 14-28), in comparison to no diary (median 28; range 14-38). CONCLUSIONS: Currently there is minimal evidence from RCTs of the benefits or harms of patient diaries for patients and their caregivers or family members. A small study has described their potential to reduce post-traumatic stress symptomatology in family members. However, there is currently inadequate evidence to support their effectiveness in improving psychological recovery after critical illness for patients and their family members.",0
873,"BACKGROUND: During intensive care unit (ICU) admission, patients experience extreme physical and psychological stressors, including the abnormal ICU environment. These experiences impact on a patient's recovery from critical illness and may result in both physical and psychological disorders. One strategy that has been developed and implemented by clinical staff to treat the psychological distress prevalent in ICU survivors is the use of patient diaries. These provide a background to the cause of the patient's ICU admission and an ongoing narrative outlining day-to-day activities. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of a diary versus no diary on patients, and their caregivers or families, during the patient's recovery from admission to an ICU. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to January 2014), EBSCOhost CINAHL (1982 to January 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1980 to January 2014), PsycINFO (1950 to January 2014), Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) database (1971 to January 2014); Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science and Social Science and Humanities (1990 to January 2014); seven clinical trial registries and reference lists of identified trials. We applied no language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or clinical controlled trials (CCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of patient diaries, when compared to no ICU diary, for patients or family members to promote recovery after admission to ICU. Outcome measures for describing recovery from ICU included the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptomatology, health-related quality of life and costs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological approaches as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently reviewed titles for inclusion, extracted data and undertook risk of bias according to prespecified criteria. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three eligible studies; two describing ICU patients (N = 358), and one describing relatives of ICU patients (N = 30). The study involving relatives of ICU patients was a substudy of family members from one of the ICU patient studies. There was a mixed risk of bias within the included studies. Blinding of participants to allocation was not possible and blinding of the outcome assessment was not adequately achieved or reported. Overall the quality of the evidence was low to very low. The patient diary intervention was not identical between studies. However, each provided a prospectively prepared, day-to-day description of the participants' ICU admission.No study adequately reported on risk of PTSD as described using a clinical interview, family or caregiver anxiety or depression, health-related quality of life or costs. Within a single study there was no clear evidence of a difference in risk for developing anxiety (risk ratio (RR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 1.19) or depression (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.19) in participants who received ICU diaries, in comparison to those that did not receive a patient diary. However, the results were imprecise and consistent with benefit in either group, or no difference. Within a single study there was no evidence of difference in median post-traumatic stress symptomatology scores (diaries 24, SD 11.6; no diary 24, SD 11.6) and delusional ICU memory recall (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.28) between the patients recovering from ICU admission who received patient diaries, and those who did not. One study reported reduced post-traumatic stress symptomatology in family members of patients recovering from admission to ICU who received patient diaries (median 19; range 14 to 28), in comparison to no diary (median 28; range 14 to 38). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently there is minimal evidence from RCTs of the benefits or harms of patient diaries for patients and their caregivers or family members. A small study has described their potential to reduce post-traumatic stress symptomatology in family members. However, there is currently inadequate evidence to support their effectiveness in improving psychological recovery after critical illness for patients and their family members.",0
874,"AIM: To systematically evaluate the effect of intensive care unit diary psychotherapy on the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression after discharge from intensive care unit. BACKGROUND: Many studies have reported the potential advantages and risks of intensive care unit diary psychotherapy in adult patients discharged from intensive care unit, but the results are divergent. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective randomized controlled or case-controlled studies. DATA SOURCE: Databases such as Cochran Library, Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, and ProQuest databases, China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI) were searched for literatures published from January 2000-March 2020. REVIEW METHODS: We use the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for quality assessment and audit manager 5.3 software for meta-analysis. The main result is the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. RESULTS: Ten studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified, including eight randomized controlled studies and two case-controlled studies, with a total of 1,210 patients. The pooled results of this meta-analysis indicated that the intensive care unit diary could reduce the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. CONCLUSION: This study showed that an intensive care unit diary could improve the psychological symptoms of adult intensive care unit patients after discharge. However, due to limitations such as publication bias and case sample size, the results should be carefully considered. Researchers need to further clarify the multidisciplinary collaborative process of intensive care unit diary therapy, the real beneficiaries, and its impact on family members' psychological status by conducting large, robust studies in the future. IMPACT: This study's findings suggest that medical staff need to re-examine the role of intensive care unit diary therapy, its standardized implementation and provide effective intervention for reducing psychological stress-related symptoms of intensive care unit patients after discharge.",0
875,"INTRODUCTION: Patients discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) suffer from long-term symptoms affecting the physical, psychological, and cognitive well-being and cannot understand memories and dreams. Intensive care unit diaries describe daily events about the patient and may allow them to reconstruct their experience. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the effects of ICU diaries on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched up to May 6, 2022. We included RCTs comparing patients admitted to the ICU who received a diary to those who did not receive a diary. The primary outcome was the rate of PTSD. Secondary outcomes were rates of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: We included 7 RCTs. Patients who received a diary during the ICU admission had reduced rate of PTSD (78/432 [18%] vs 106/422 [25%]; risk ratio [RR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.94; P = .02; I2 = 0%; trial sequential analysis-adjusted CI, 0.55-0.97) when compared with patients who did not receive a diary. We found a non-statistically significant difference toward a reduction in the rate of depression (38/232 [16%] vs 54/224 [24%]; RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.49-1.01; P = .06; I2 = 0%) and anxiety (63/232 [27%] vs 70/224 [31%]; RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.29-1.40; P = .26; I2 = 67%). CONCLUSIONS: Providing an ICU diary to patients admitted to the ICU reduced the rate of PTSD symptoms compared with usual care.",0
876,"The various views and language used in the discussion of stress and distress lead to confusion in the scientific, regulatory, and animal welfare communities. Indeed, the animal welfare literature itself does not distinguish stress from distress in any systematic fashion, and the term distress rarely appears in the biomedical sciences literature. In addition, the U.S. Government Principles and the Animal Welfare Act (see below) use both terms without definitions. Moreover, the general public often uses “stress” and “distress” interchangeably, and frequently in conjunction with the term “suffering,” thus blurring distinctions between these concepts. Because there is in fact good scientific evidence for both an adaptive stress response and a state of distress, it is important to distinguish these terms. Even though this chapter attempts to clarify these terms as much as possible, the available scientific information—while useful—is far from complete, and distress remains a complex and still poorly understood phenomenon. This chapter, therefore, is an amalgam of current scientific information, along with the Committee members’ perspectives, best professional judgment, and expert opinion.",0
877,"OBJECTIVES: To explore factors associated with unplanned extubation in Intensive Care Unit for adult patients. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed of studies identified through Pubmed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and Web of Science published from initiation to September 2017. Only articles in English were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the included articles. RESULTS: Ten eligible studies were identified, encompassing a total of 2092 patients (457 in the unplanned extubation group; 1635 in the control group). The subsequent meta-analysis identified significant risk factors for unplanned extubation are male [odds ratio (OR) 1.54, 95% CI 1.12-2.12; P = 0.008], confusion [OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.05-0.17; P < 0.00001], physical restraint [OR 3.10, 95% CI 2.21-4.34; P < 0.00001], higher GCS scores [mean difference (MD) 1.06, 95% CI 0.59-1.52; P < 0.00001] and lower APACHE II scores [MD -2.26, 95% CI -3.35- -1.16; P < 0.0001]. Renal disease is a protective factor for unplanned extubation [OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15-0.70; P = 0.004]. CONCLUSION: Patients were male, confused, having physical restraint, with higher GCS and lower APACHE II scores are significant risk factors for unplanned extubation in Intensive Care Unit adult patients.",0
878,"Falls frequently occur in persons with cognitive impairment, including delirium. This article presents a systematic review of the association between falls and delirium in adults aged 65 years or older. For the studies that compared falls and delirium, the risk ratio was consistently elevated (median RR 4.5, range 1.4-12.6) and statistically significant in all but one study. These results suggest that falls and delirium are inextricably linked. There is a need to further refine fall risk assessment tools and protocols to specifically include delirium for consideration as a risk factor that needs additional assessment and management.",0
879,"Background: Better understanding of patients’ and their family members’ experiences of delirium and related distress during critical care is required to inform the development of targeted nonpharmacologic interventions. Objective: To examine and synthesize qualitative data on patients’ and their family members’ delirium experiences and relieving factors in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Design: We conducted a systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis. Eligible studies contained adult patient or family quotes about delirium during critical care, published in English in a peer-reviewed journal since 1980. Data sources included PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane and Clinicaltrials.gov. Methods: Systematic searches yielded 3238 identified articles, of which 14 reporting 13 studies were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Qualitative meta-synthesis was performed through line-by-line coding of relevant quotes, organisation of codes into descriptive themes, and development of analytical themes. Five patients/family members with experience of ICU delirium contributed to the thematic analysis. Results: Qualitative meta-synthesis resulted in four major themes and two sub-themes. Key new patient and family-centric insights regarding delirium-related distress in the ICU included articulation of the distinct emotions experienced during and after delirium (for patients, predominantly fear, anger and shame); its ‘whole-person’ nature; and the value that patients and family members placed on clinicians’ compassion, communication, and connectedness. Conclusions: Distinct difficult emotions and other forms of distress are experienced by patients and families during ICU delirium, during which patients and family members highly value human kindness and empathy. Future studies should further explore and address the many facets of delirium-related distress during critical care using these insights and include patient-reported measures of the predominant difficult emotions.",0

881,"Delirium is an acute deterioration in attention, conscious state, perception, and cognition of a person. While nurses possess the theoretical understanding of the condition, they lack insight into its early recognition and management. This systematic review aims to understand what factors influence nurses as they care for patients with delirium, and to identify best practices to improve overall clinical care. The Qualitative Evidence Synthesis (QES), as a strategy process to identify gaps in research, formulate new models or strategies for care, underpinned the review. In addition to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, a methodological assessment, data were analysed using QES, as informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute Review process. Ten studies were identified and synthesised to generate four key themes. The themes included (1) nurse's knowledge deficit; (2) increased workload and stress; (3) safety concerns among nurse when caring for patients with delirium; and (4) strategies used when caring for patients with delirium. Overall, the review has highlighted the need for increased delirium education and coping strategies among nurses to effectively care for patients with delirium. This may be augmented through regular education sessions to provide nurses with the confidence and competence to care for the acutely confused person.",0
882,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is a multifactorial syndrome closely associated with negative hospitalisation outcomes. Given the global growth of the ageing population, delirium becomes increasingly prevalent among older persons. Nurses play a pivotal role in delirium management and receive direct impacts of delirious presentations. Yet, there is a dearth of literature reviewing nurses' experiences. OBJECTIVE: To synthesise the best available evidence exploring nurses' experiences in managing delirium of older persons in acute care wards. DESIGN: Systematic review of qualitative studies and meta-aggregation. DATA SOURCES: Published and unpublished literature between January 2010 and December 2020 were identified from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, PsycINFO and ProQuest. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic search strategy was applied in October 2020, with an update in January 2021. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts and selected the eligible studies after reading the full texts. This review included studies focusing on licensed nurses providing care to patients aged 65 and above, having any type of delirium during their hospitalisation stays in acute care settings. Studies included are qualitative papers with research designs such as phenomenology, ethnography, qualitative descriptive and grounded theory. The eligible studies were appraised independently using The JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research. Data of included studies were extracted by two independent reviewers using a standardised form. Findings were synthesised by the meta-aggregative approach. RESULTS: Thirty-one papers that considered nurses' (n = 464) experiences in managing older persons' delirium were included. A total of 375 findings were extracted, aggregated into 23 categories, and developed 5 synthesised findings: (i) delirium detection could be hindered when nurses possess a narrowed view of delirium, (ii) nurses navigate through complexity when providing multi-faceted care, (iii) nurses carry personal emotions, assumptions, and identities, (iv) various stakeholders have double-edged influences, and (v) nurses display preferences in their learning needs. CONCLUSION: This review informed about nurses' perceptions of delirium, delirious older persons, and their nursing management which were specific to older persons and acute care settings. Nurses should practise self-awareness regarding their own knowledge and attitudes while performing delirium management in older adults. Meanwhile, healthcare professionals and policymakers should make a concerted effort in cultivating a better working environment. Future research of delirium care that specifically investigates with a geriatric perspective would better contribute to the improvement of evidence-based nursing practices for older persons.",0
883,"To synthesize literature addressing maternal distress and associated variables in response to infant hospitalization in the NICU. CINAHL, Medline, PubMed, PsychINFO, and Scopus were searched for studies addressing maternal distress during NICU hospitalization published between January 2009 and August 2019. The initial literature search yielded 862 articles. Articles were included for analysis if (a) they were peer-reviewed, (b) maternal distress was defined or measured, and (c) maternal distress occurred in the NICU. Ultimately, 33 articles were included for analysis. Distress symptoms were not consistently measured across the literature by one specific instrument. However, despite the variety of instruments, distress was prevalent in this population. Individual elements of maternal distress in the NICU include depression, anxiety, trauma, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. These elements often occur together and tend to follow a specific trajectory during hospitalization. This body of literature was inconsistent regarding the timing of distress measurement as well as the relationship between relevant associated variables (e.g., marital status or infant illness severity) and maternal distress. Additionally, researchers often excluded mothers of non-preterm infants and infants with congenital anomalies from investigation. Researchers and clinicians should carefully consider timing and instrumentation in their interpretations of maternal distress measurement during a NICU hospitalization. Future work should focus on developing a comprehensive, valid, and reliable screening tool for clinicians and researchers to use to identify maternal distress in the NICU. Additionally, future research should address gaps in the populations included in studies.",0
884,"OBJECTIVES: To study memories of ICU following discharge, their associations, and impact on mental health and quality of life in a low- and middle-income country. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort; data on memories (pain, fear, nightmare, factual), clinical and demographic variables, anxiety-depression, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and quality of life were collected 0, 7, 14, 30, 90, and 180 days post discharge. Home visits for assessment minimized loss to follow-up. Linear mixed-models and regression analyses were used to estimate adjusted effects of memories controlling for age, sex, time, and severity of illness. SETTING: Twenty-five bedded ICU of a tertiary care center in East India. PATIENTS: Adult ICU survivors between January 2017 and July 2018 able to communicate their memories. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Final sample consisted of 322 patients who completed 180 days follow-up. Pain, fear, factual, and nightmare memories dropped from 85%, 56%, 55%, and 45% at discharge to less than or equal to 5% at 180 days. Patients with gaps in ICU memory had worse anxiety-depression, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and quality of life at all follow-up points. Sedation (odds ratio, 0.54; CI, 0.4-0.7), steroids (odds ratio, 0.47; CI, 0.3-0.8), benzodiazepines (odds ratio, 1.74; CI, 1-3.04), and mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 0.43; CI, 0.2-0.8) were independently associated with gaps in memory. Non-ICU factor such as substance addiction (odds ratio, 5.38; CI, 2-14) was associated with memories affecting mental health and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Gaps in memory and various memory types were common after ICU admission, whose prevalence waned over time. Compared with nightmares and fearful memories, gaps in memories were most strongly associated with poor mental health and quality of life. Identifying patients with gaps in memories might be an objective way of planning interventions to improve their long-term outcomes.",0
885,"OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively the relationship between memories of intensive care (ICU) and levels of anxiety after ICU discharge, the stability of these memories with time, and their relationship to the development of acute posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms. DESIGN: Case series cohort assessed by interview at 2 and 8 wks after ICU discharge. SETTING: District general hospital (serving a population of 350,000) general intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Memories of ICU and anxiety levels were studied in 45 patients after ICU discharge. Thirty patients were examined again at 8 wks to assess memory stability and development of acute PTSD-related symptoms. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Standardized interviews and questionnaires were used to assess memory for ICU, anxiety, and depression 2 wks after ICU discharge. In addition, PTSD-related symptoms and panic were assessed 8 wks after ICU discharge. A total of 33 of 45 patients had delusional memories from ICU at 2 wks; nine of the patients with delusional memories had no factual memories, and these patients had higher anxiety levels 2 wks after ICU discharge (p < .0001). Thirty patients had paired assessments at 2 and 8 wks. Those patients who had no factual recall of ICU but had delusional memories at 2 wks scored highly for PTSD-related symptoms and panic attacks at 8 wks (p = .023 and .014, respectively). The only predictors of possible acute PTSD-related symptoms at the 8-wk assessment were trait anxiety (p = .006) and having delusional memories without recall of factual events in the ICU at 2 wks (p < .0001). Only delusional memories were retained over time, whereas the recall of factual events in the ICU declined. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the development of acute PTSD-related symptoms may be related more to recall of delusions alone. This study suggests that even relatively unpleasant memories for real events during critical illness may give some protection from anxiety and the later development of PTSD-related symptoms when memories of delusions are prominent.",0
886,"Objective: The absence of a tool for assessing memory after being treated on the intensive care unit (ICU) has inhibited research. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and validate a tool known as the ICU Memory Tool (ICUMT) for assessing memory forintensive care during the recovery period. Validity was assessed through internal consistency, construct validity and test-retest reliability. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Single intensive care unit in a district general hospital. Subjects and measurements: Forty-five patients recovering from critical illness. The ICUMT consists of 14 items administered by clinical interview. Main results: The ICU Memory Tool was internally consistent (alpha coefficient 0.86). Some evidence for the tool's construct validity was found as a predicted relationship between infection and memory loss was confirmed (p < 0.04). Good test-retest reliability was found over a 4-month period for factual memories (r = 0.84, p < 0.0001) and delusion memories (r = 0.91, p < 0.0001). However, memories of feelings were not as consistent over the 4-month period (r = 0.69, p > 0.0002). Conclusions: The initial reliability testing and validity check of the new ICUMT was favourable.",0
887,"PURPOSE: To develop an instrument for use at ICU discharge for prediction of psychological problems in ICU survivors. METHODS: Multinational, prospective cohort study in ten general ICUs in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. Adult patients with an ICU stay ≥ 12 h were eligible for inclusion. Patients in need of neurointensive care, with documented cognitive impairment, unable to communicate in the local language, without a home address or with more than one limitation of therapy were excluded. Primary outcome was psychological morbidity 3 months after ICU discharge, defined as Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) subscale score ≥ 11 or Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms Checklist-14 (PTSS-14) part B score > 45. RESULTS: A total of 572 patients were included and 78% of patients alive at follow-up responded to questionnaires. Twenty percent were classified as having psychological problems post-ICU. Of 18 potential risk factors, four were included in the final prediction model after multivariable logistic regression analysis: symptoms of depression [odds ratio (OR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.50], traumatic memories (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.13-1.82), lack of social support (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.47-7.32) and age (age-dependent OR, peak risk at age 49-65 years). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) for the instrument was 0.76 (95% CI 0.70-0.81). CONCLUSIONS: We developed an instrument to predict individual patients' risk for psychological problems 3 months post-ICU, http://www.imm.ki.se/biostatistics/calculators/psychmorb/ . The instrument can be used for triage of patients for psychological ICU follow-up. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02679157.",0

889,"INTRODUCTION: Guidelines recommend follow-up for patients after an intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Methods for identifying patients with psychological problems after intensive care would be of value, to optimize treatment and to improve adequate resource allocation in ICU follow-up of ICU survivors. The aim of the study was to develop a predictive screening instrument, for use at ICU discharge, to identify patients at risk for post-traumatic stress, anxiety or depression. METHODS: Twenty-one potential risk factors for psychological problems - patient characteristics and ICU-related variables - were prospectively collected at ICU discharge. Two months after ICU discharge 252 ICU survivors received the questionnaires Post-Traumatic Stress Symptom scale -10 (PTSS-10) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to estimate the degree of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Of the 150 responders, 46 patients (31%) had adverse psychological outcome, defined as PTSS-10 >35 and/or HADS subscales ≥8. After analysis, six predictors were included in the screening instrument: major pre-existing disease, being a parent to children younger than 18 years of age, previous psychological problems, in-ICU agitation, being unemployed or on sick-leave at ICU admission and appearing depressed in the ICU. The total risk score was related to the probability for adverse psychological outcome in the individual patient. The predictive accuracy of the screening instrument, as assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was 0.77. When categorizing patients in three risk probability groups - low (0 to 29%), moderate (30 to 59%) high risk (60 to 100%), the actual prevalence of adverse psychological outcome in respective groups was 12%, 50% and 63%. CONCLUSION: The screening instrument developed in this study may aid ICU clinicians in identifying patients at risk for adverse psychological outcome two months after critical illness. Prior to wider clinical use, external validation is needed.",0
890,"BACKGROUND: To examine the relationship between delusional memories from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, health related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety, and symptoms of depression in patients with physical trauma, 6 months to 18 months after their ICU stay. METHODS: Multicenter study in five combined medical and surgical ICUs (n = 239). A questionnaire comprising the Medical outcome Short Form 36, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, and the Intensive Care Unit Memory tool was sent to the patients with trauma 6 months to 18 months after their discharge from the ICU. Clinical data were drawn from patient records in retrospect. A matched reference sample (n = 159) was randomly drawn from the Swedish Short Form 36 norm database (n = 8,930). RESULTS: Patients with trauma had significantly lower HRQoL than the reference sample. One or more delusional memories such as hallucinations, nightmares, dreams, or sensations of people trying to hurt them in the ICU were experienced by 26%. These patients were significantly younger, had a longer ICU stay, relied more on mechanical ventilation, and had higher Injury Severity Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. They also reported a significantly poorer HRQoL and a higher probability of experiencing anxiety (51% vs. 29%) and symptoms of depression (48% vs. 26%) compared with patients without such memories. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of treating the delusional memories experienced by ICU patients with a trauma diagnosis as a postinjury factor with a potential to create anxiety and symptoms of depression and which may affect HRQoL after discharge.",0
891,"The psychological impact of critical illness on a patient can be severe, and frequently results in acute distress as well as psychological morbidity after leaving hospital. A UK guideline states that patients should be assessed in critical care units, both for acute distress and risk of future psychological morbidity; but no suitable method for carrying out this assessment exists. The Intensive care psychological assessment tool (IPAT) was developed as a simple, quick screening tool to be used routinely to detect acute distress, and the risk of future psychological morbidity, in critical care units.",0
893,"BACKGROUND: Moral distress is a neglected issue in most palliative education programmes, and research has largely focused on this phenomenon as an occupational problem for nursing staff. RESEARCH QUESTION: The primary outcome of this study was to explore the causes of morally distressing events, feelings experienced by nurses and coping strategies utilised by a nursing population at an Italian teaching hospital. A secondary outcome of this qualitative study was to analyse whether palliative care or end-of-life care education may reduce morally distressing events. RESEARCH DESIGN: A hermeneutic-phenomenological qualitative study was performed. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: Participants were recruited through snowball sampling. The interviews were conducted and recorded by one interviewer and transcribed verbatim. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Hospital Board. FINDINGS: Six main themes emerged from the interview analyses: (1) the causes of moral distress; (2) feelings and emotions experienced during morally distressing events; (3) factors that affect the experience of moral distress; (4) strategies for coping with moral distress; (5) recovering from morally distressing events; and (6) end-of-life accompaniment. Varying opinions regarding the usefulness of palliative care education existed. Some nurses stated that participation in end-of-life courses did not help them cope with morally distressing events in the ward, and they believe that existing courses should be strengthened and better structured. DISCUSSION: In this study, moral distress was often associated with poor communication or a lack of communication between healthcare professionals and the patients and/or their relatives and with the inability to satisfy the patients' last requests. According to our findings, the concept of 'good' end-of-life accompaniment was extremely important to our sample for the prevention of morally distressing events. CONCLUSION: Nurses who work in the onco-haematological setting frequently experience moral distress. Determining the causes of moral distress at early stages is of paramount importance for finding a solution.",0
894,"BACKGROUND Despite the significant burden of delirium among hospitalized adults, critical appraisal of systematic data on delirium diagnosis, pathophysiology, treatment, prevention, and outcomes is lacking. PURPOSE To provide evidence-based recommendations for delirium care to practitioners, and identify gaps in delirium research. DATA SOURCES Medline, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) information systems fromJanuary 1966 to April 2011. STUDY SELECTION All published systematic evidence reviews (SERs) on delirium were evaluated. DATA EXTRACTION Three reviewers independently extracted the data regarding delirium risk factors, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and outcomes, and critically appraised each SER as good, fair, or poor using the United States Preventive Services Task Force criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS Twenty-two SERs graded as good or fair provided the data. Age, cognitive impairment, depression, anticholinergic drugs, and lorazepam use were associated with an increased risk for developing delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is reliable for delirium diagnosis outside of the intensive care unit. Multicomponent nonpharmacological interventions are effective in reducing delirium incidence in elderly medical patients. Low-dose haloperidol has similar efficacy as atypical antipsychotics for treating delirium. Delirium is associated with poor outcomes independent of age, severity of illness, or dementia. CONCLUSION Delirium is an acute, preventable medical condition with short- and long-term negative effects on a patient’s cognitive and functional states.",0
895,"Background: Data regarding delivery of evidence-based care to critically ill patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial but lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the implementation rate of the ABCDEF bundle, which is a collection of six evidence-based ICU care initiatives which are strongly recommended to be incorporated into clinical practice, and ICU diaries for patients with and without COVID-19 infections in ICUs, and to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on implementation of each element of the bundle and independent associated factors. Methods: A world-wide 1-day point prevalence study investigated the delivery of the ABCDEF bundle and ICU diary to patients without or with COVID-19 infections on 27 January 2021 via an online questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for patient demographics evaluated the impact of COVID-19 and identified factors in ICU administrative structures and policies independently associated with delivery. Results: From 54 countries and 135 ICUs, 1,229 patients were eligible, and 607 (49%) had COVID-19 infections. Implementation rates were: entire bundle (without COVID-19: 0% and with COVID-19: 1%), Element A (regular pain assessment: 64 and 55%), Element B (both spontaneous awakening and breathing trials: 17 and 10%), Element C (regular sedation assessment: 45 and 61%), Element D (regular delirium assessment: 39 and 35%), Element E (exercise: 22 and 25%), Element F (family engagement/empowerment: 16 and 30%), and ICU diary (17 and 21%). The presence of COVID-19 was not associated with failure to implement individual elements. Independently associated factors for each element in common between the two groups included presence of a specific written protocol, application of a target/goal, and tele-ICU management. A lower income status country and a 3:1 nurse-patient ratio were significantly associated with non-implementation of elements A, C, and D, while a lower income status country was also associated with implementation of element F. Conclusions: Regardless of COVID-19 infection status, implementation rates for the ABCDEF bundle, for each element individually and an ICU diary were extremely low for patients without and with COVID-19 infections during the pandemic. Strategies to facilitate implementation of and adherence to the complete ABCDEF bundle should be optimized and addressed based on unit-specific barriers and facilitators.",0
896,"AIMS: This study was performed to identify and summarize systematic reviews focusing on the prevention of unplanned endotracheal extubation in the intensive care unit.

A literature search of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, CINAH, Embase, Web of Science, SINOMED and PROSPERO was performed from January 1, 2005-June 1, 2021. A systematic review focusing on unplanned extubation was included, resulting in an evidence summary. RESULTS: Thirteen systematic reviews were included. A summary of evidence on unplanned endotracheal extubation was developed, and the main contents were risk factors, preventive measures and prognosis. The most important nursing measures were restraint, fixation of the tracheal tube, continuous quality improvement, psychological care and use of a root cause analysis for the occurrence of unplanned endotracheal extubation. CONCLUSIONS: This overview re-evaluated risk factors and preventive measures for unplanned endotracheal extubation in the intensive care unit, resulting in a summary of evidence for preventing unplanned endotracheal extubation and providing direction for future research.

898,"BACKGROUND: The accuracy with which surgeons can predict outcomes following surgery has not been explored in a systematic way. The aim of this review was to determine how accurately a surgeon's 'gut feeling' or perception of risk correlates with patient outcomes and available risk scoring systems. METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A narrative synthesis was performed in accordance with the Guidance on the Conduct of Narrative Synthesis In Systematic Reviews. Studies comparing surgeons' preoperative or postoperative assessment of patient outcomes were included. Studies that made comparisons with risk scoring tools were also included. Outcomes evaluated were postoperative mortality, general and operation-specific morbidity and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies comprising 20 898 patients undergoing general, gastrointestinal, cardiothoracic, orthopaedic, vascular, urology, endocrine and neurosurgical operations were included. Surgeons consistently overpredicted mortality rates and were outperformed by existing risk scoring tools in six of seven studies comparing area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC). Surgeons' prediction of general morbidity was good, and was equivalent to, or better than, pre-existing risk prediction models. Long-term outcomes were poorly predicted by surgeons, with AUC values ranging from 0·51 to 0·75. Four of five studies found postoperative risk estimates to be more accurate than those made before surgery. CONCLUSION: Surgeons consistently overestimate mortality risk and are outperformed by pre-existing tools; prediction of longer-term outcomes is also poor. Surgeons should consider the use of risk prediction tools when available to inform clinical decision-making.",0
899,"BACKGROUND: Timely identification of patients at a high risk of clinical deterioration is key to prioritizing care, allocating resources effectively, and preventing adverse outcomes. Vital signs-based, aggregate-weighted early warning systems are commonly used to predict the risk of outcomes related to cardiorespiratory instability and sepsis, which are strong predictors of poor outcomes and mortality. Machine learning models, which can incorporate trends and capture relationships among parameters that aggregate-weighted models cannot, have recently been showing promising results. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify, summarize, and evaluate the available research, current state of utility, and challenges with machine learning-based early warning systems using vital signs to predict the risk of physiological deterioration in acutely ill patients, across acute and ambulatory care settings. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed, original studies with keywords related to ""vital signs,"" ""clinical deterioration,"" and ""machine learning."" Included studies used patient vital signs along with demographics and described a machine learning model for predicting an outcome in acute and ambulatory care settings. Data were extracted following PRISMA, TRIPOD, and Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. RESULTS: We identified 24 peer-reviewed studies from 417 articles for inclusion; 23 studies were retrospective, while 1 was prospective in nature. Care settings included general wards, intensive care units, emergency departments, step-down units, medical assessment units, postanesthetic wards, and home care. Machine learning models including logistic regression, tree-based methods, kernel-based methods, and neural networks were most commonly used to predict the risk of deterioration. The area under the curve for models ranged from 0.57 to 0.97. CONCLUSIONS: In studies that compared performance, reported results suggest that machine learning-based early warning systems can achieve greater accuracy than aggregate-weighted early warning systems but several areas for further research were identified. While these models have the potential to provide clinical decision support, there is a need for standardized outcome measures to allow for rigorous evaluation of performance across models. Further research needs to address the interpretability of model outputs by clinicians, clinical efficacy of these systems through prospective study design, and their potential impact in different clinical settings.",0
900,"Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.",0
901,"OBJECTIVE: Few studies have examined the disproportionate use of restraints for Black adults receiving emergency psychiatric care. This study sought to determine whether the odds of physical and chemical restraint use were higher for Black patients undergoing emergency psychiatric care compared with their White counterparts. METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study examined 12,977 unique encounters of adults receiving an emergency psychiatric evaluation between January 1, 2014, and September 18, 2020, at a large academic medical center in Durham, North Carolina. Self-reported race categories were extracted from the electronic medical record. Primary outcomes were the presence of a behavioral physical restraint order or chemical restraint administration during the emergency department encounter. Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, height, time of arrival, positive urine drug screen results, peak blood alcohol concentration, and diagnosis of a bipolar or psychotic disorder. RESULTS: A total of 961 (7.4%) encounters involved physical restraint, and 2,047 (15.8%) involved chemical restraint. Models with and without a race covariate were compared by using quasi-likelihood information criterion scores; in each instance, the model with race performed better than the model without. Black patients were more likely to be physically (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.07-1.72) and chemically (AOR=1.33; 95% CI=1.15-1.55) restrained than White patients. CONCLUSIONS: After analyses were adjusted for measured confounders, Black patients undergoing psychiatric evaluation were at higher odds of experiencing physical or chemical restraint compared with White patients, which is consistent with the growing body of evidence revealing racial disparities in psychiatric care.",0

903,"INTRODUCTION: Debate continues with respect to when to introduce interprofessional education for maximal potential benefit. One perspective is that interprofessional education should be introduced early in the undergraduate curriculum before students develop stereotyped impressions of other professional groups. However, it may be that students at entry to medical school have already developed these stereotypical impressions. This study examines perceived professional characteristics of doctors and nurses by students entering medical school. METHODOLOGY: Year 1 medical students in 4 consecutive years completed a questionnaire on their perceptions of the characteristics and backgrounds of nurses and doctors and on their attitudes to shared teaching. RESULTS: Year 1 medical students were found to perceive the characteristics of doctors and nurses differently. They considered nurses to be more caring and doctors to be more arrogant. They considered nurses to have lower academic ability, competence and status, although comparable life experience. They were generally very positive about beginning shared learning at an early stage of training. DISCUSSION: Whilst it is encouraging that medical students are positive about shared teaching, it is of concern that they have a poor perception of the academic ability, status in society and professional competence of the nurse at entry to medical school. These perceived impressions, which may reflect societal misconceptions regarding the roles and responsibilities of nurses within a modern health care system, may have an impact on the success of early interprofessional teaching initiatives in undergraduate curricula.",0
904,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to collect information that is needed to develop interprofessional education curricula by examining the current status of interprofessional conflicts and the demand for interprofessional education. METHODS: A total of 95 doctors and 92 nurses in three university hospitals in Seoul responded to a survey that comprised questions on past experience with interprofessional conflicts, the causes and solutions of such conflicts, past experience with interprofessional education, and the demand for interprofessional education. RESULTS: We found that 86% of doctors and 62.6% of nurses had no interprofessional education experience. Most of them learned about the work of other health professions naturally through work experience, and many had experienced at least one interprofessional conflict. For doctors, the most popular method of resolving interprofessional conflicts was to let the event pass; for nurses, it was to inform the department head. Further, 41.5% of doctors and 56.7% of nurses expressed no knowledge of an official system for resolving interprofessional conflicts within the hospital, and 62.8% of doctors and 78.3% of nurses stated that they would participate in interprofessional education if the opportunity arose. CONCLUSION: In Korean hospital organizations, many doctors and nurses have experienced conflicts with other health professionals. By developing an appropriate curriculum and educational training system, the opportunities for health professionals to receive interprofessional education should expand.",0
905,"BACKGROUND: To identify facilitators and barriers that residents, medical and nursing students perceive in their Interprofessional Education (IPE) in a clinical setting with other healthcare students. METHODS: A systematic review was carried out to identify the perceptions of medical students, residents and nursing students regarding IPE in a clinical setting. PubMed, CINAHL, ERIC and PsycInfo were searched, using keywords and MeSH terms from each database's inception published prior to June 2014. Interprofessional education involving nursing and medical students and/or residents in IPE were selected by the first author. Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion or exclusion and extracted the data. RESULTS: Sixty-five eligible papers (27 quantitative, 16 qualitative and 22 mixed methods) were identified and synthesized using narrative synthesis. Perceptions and attitudes of residents and students could be categorized into 'Readiness for IPE', 'Barriers to IPE' and 'Facilitators of IPE'. Within each category they work at three levels: individual, process/curricular and cultural/organizational. Readiness for IPE at individual level is higher in females, irrespective of prior healthcare experience. At process level readiness for IPE fluctuates during medical school, at cultural level collaboration is jeopardized when groups interact poorly. Examples of IPE-barriers are at individual level feeling intimidated by doctors, at process level lack of formal assessment and at cultural level exclusion of medical students from interaction by nurses. Examples of IPE-facilitators are at individual level affective crises and patient care crises situations that create feelings of urgency, at process level small group learning activities in an authentic context and at cultural level getting acquainted informally. These results are related to a model for learning and teaching, to illustrate the implications for the design of IPE. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the uncovered barriers are at the cultural level and most of the facilitators are at the process level. Factors at the individual level need more research.",0
906,"PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to describe the development and implementation of an interprofessional simulation-based education (IPSE) for undergraduate nursing and medical students, their perceptions of the impact of IPSE, and identify their changes in attitudes toward each other's health professions after participating in IPSE in South Korea. METHODS: This study used a qualitative descriptive design. A purposive sample of 43 third-year medical students and a convenient sample of 44 fourth-year nursing students participated in a 2-day IPSE program that consisted of ice-breaking and patient safety activities, and 4-hour three interprofessional team-based high-fidelity simulation education sessions. Data were collected through reflective journal after the IPSE program and keywords before and after the IPSE program, and were analyzed using the content analysis and word cloud analysis. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: ""positive experience"" with understanding roles and responsibilities and learning by doing in simulation environments being reported. In the second theme, ""positive learning outcomes"" participants reported enhancing collaboration and confidence in communication skills. The final theme ""benefits to patients of interprofessional collaborative practice"" included high quality of care and patient safety. Before the IPSE experience, most medical students perceived the nurse as nightingale and syringe, and nursing students perceived the doctor as order, expert, and knowledge. After their IPSE experience, both nursing and medical students viewed each other as colleagues. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the use of high-fidelity team-based simulation in IPE is effective in practicing and developing undergraduate nursing and medical students' interprofessional collaboration through hands-on experience.",0
907,"IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of e-cigarette use among US youth increased from 2011 to 2018. Continued monitoring of the prevalence of e-cigarette and other tobacco product use among youth is important to inform public health policy, planning, and regulatory efforts. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of e-cigarette use among US high school and middle school students in 2019 including frequency of use, brands used, and use of flavored products. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analyses of a school-based nationally representative sample of 19 018 US students in grades 6 to 12 participating in the 2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey. The survey was conducted from February 15, 2019, to May 24, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported current (past 30-day) e-cigarette use estimates among high school and middle school students; frequent use (≥20 days in the past 30 days) and usual e-cigarette brand among current e-cigarette users; and use of flavored e-cigarettes and flavor types among current exclusive e-cigarette users (no use of other tobacco products) by school level and usual brand. Prevalence estimates were weighted to account for the complex sampling design. RESULTS: The survey included 10 097 high school students (mean [SD] age, 16.1 [3.0] years; 47.5% female) and 8837 middle school students (mean [SD] age, 12.7 [2.8] years; 48.7% female). The response rate was 66.3%. An estimated 27.5% (95% CI, 25.3%-29.7%) of high school students and 10.5% (95% CI, 9.4%-11.8%) of middle school students reported current e-cigarette use. Among current e-cigarette users, an estimated 34.2% (95% CI, 31.2%-37.3%) of high school students and 18.0% (95% CI, 15.2%-21.2%) of middle school students reported frequent use, and an estimated 63.6% (95% CI, 59.3%-67.8%) of high school students and 65.4% (95% CI, 60.6%-69.9%) of middle school students reported exclusive use of e-cigarettes. Among current e-cigarette users, an estimated 59.1% (95% CI, 54.8%-63.2%) of high school students and 54.1% (95% CI, 49.1%-59.0%) of middle school students reported JUUL as their usual e-cigarette brand in the past 30 days; among current e-cigarette users, 13.8% (95% CI, 12.0%-15.9%) of high school students and 16.8% (95% CI, 13.6%-20.7%) of middle school students reported not having a usual e-cigarette brand. Among current exclusive e-cigarette users, an estimated 72.2% (95% CI, 69.1%-75.1%) of high school students and 59.2% (95% CI, 54.8%-63.4%) of middle school students used flavored e-cigarettes, with fruit, menthol or mint, and candy, desserts, or other sweets being the most commonly reported flavors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In 2019, the prevalence of self-reported e-cigarette use was high among high school and middle school students, with many current e-cigarette users reporting frequent use and most of the exclusive e-cigarette users reporting use of flavored e-cigarettes.",0

921,"In the United States, the nursing profession has been dominated by women, who constitute nearly 90% of the workforce. The profession's popularity among women has consequences for gendered assumptions about labor: unions represent a key path for demanding equitable working conditions, yet the gendered framing of nursing has undermined efforts at building a labor movement within the profession. We offer two contributions with this paper: documenting the working lives of women nurses at a pediatric hospital in Oakland, CA, and unpacking the interrelated tensions between nursing, union work, and feminism. Drawing on interviews with 10 women nurses at Children's Hospital Oakland, we analyze the complex negotiations between gender and feminism that emerge in the everyday lives of union nurses. We use the concept of feminist agency as an organizing principle for understanding the disconnects between nurses and feminist discourse, and the affordances of labor activism for gaining workplace equity and mobilizing broader commitments to health justice.",0

925,"Purpose Early clinical recognition of sepsis can be challenging. With the advancement of machine learning, promising real-time models to predict sepsis have emerged. We assessed their performance by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase.com and Scopus. Studies targeting sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock in any hospital setting were eligible for inclusion. The index test was any supervised machine learning model for real-time prediction of these conditions. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, with a tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist to evaluate risk of bias. Models with a reported area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) metric were meta-analyzed to identify strongest contributors to model performance. Results After screening, a total of 28 papers were eligible for synthesis, from which 130 models were extracted. The majority of papers were developed in the intensive care unit (ICU, n = 15; 54%), followed by hospital wards (n = 7; 25%), the emergency department (ED, n = 4; 14%) and all of these settings (n = 2; 7%). For the prediction of sepsis, diagnostic test accuracy assessed by the AUROC ranged from 0.68–0.99 in the ICU, to 0.96–0.98 in-hospital and 0.87 to 0.97 in the ED. Varying sepsis definitions limit pooling of the performance across studies. Only three papers clinically implemented models with mixed results. In the multivariate analysis, temperature, lab values, and model type contributed most to model performance. Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis show that on retrospective data, individual machine learning models can accurately predict sepsis onset ahead of time. Although they present alternatives to traditional scoring systems, between-study heterogeneity limits the assessment of pooled results. Systematic reporting and clinical implementation studies are needed to bridge the gap between bytes and bedside.

926,"Sepsis, a syndrome characterized by systemic inflammation during infection, continues to be one of the most common causes of patient mortality in hospitals across the United States. While standardized treatment protocols have been implemented, a wide variability in clinical outcomes persists across racial groups. Specifically, black and Hispanic populations are frequently associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality in sepsis compared to the white population. While this is often attributed to systemic bias against minority groups, a growing body of literature has found patient, community, and hospital-based factors to be driving racial differences. In this article, we provide a focused review on some of the factors driving racial disparities in sepsis. We also suggest potential interventions aimed at reducing health disparities in the prevention, early identification, and clinical management of sepsis.",0
927,"OBJECTIVES:          To determine whether race is a major determinant of sepsis outcomes when controlling for socioeconomic factors.         DESIGN:          Retrospective cohort study.         SETTING:          Barnes-Jewish Hospital a 1,350 bed academic medical center.         PATIENTS:          Eleven-thousand four-hundred thirty-two patients hospitalized between January 2010 and April 2017 with sepsis and septic shock.         INTERVENTIONS:          Multilevel random effects modeling was employed whereby patients were nested within ZIP codes. Individual patient characteristics and socioeconomic variables aggregated at the ZIP code level (education, employment status, income, poverty level, access to healthcare) were included in the model.         MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:          In hospital mortality, length of stay, need for vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation were the main endpoints. Black patients had more comorbidities than White patients except for cirrhosis and malignancy. In unadjusted comparisons, White individuals were more likely to require mechanical ventilation and had higher mortality rates and longer hospital stays for both low- and high-income groups. When nesting within ZIP codes and accounting for socioeconomic variables, race did not have a significant effect on mortality. Non-White races had lower odds ratio for mechanical ventilation.         CONCLUSIONS:          Our study demonstrates that race is not an independent risk factor for sepsis mortality, as well as sepsis-related length of stay. We should expand our inquiry into determinants of sepsis outcomes by including socioeconomic variables.",0
928,"BACKGROUND: Studies of sepsis evaluating sex- and race-related disparities in treatment and outcome have been limited by using administrative databases, which may not adequately capture sepsis diagnosis, used limited number and types of races, or not included both sex and race in the analyses. OBJECTIVE: To determine if patients of different races and sexes with sepsis have different mortality, receipt of mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy, or time to antibiotics? METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 34,999 patients with sepsis, defined by Sepsis-3 criteria, using logistic regression and linear regression. RESULTS: After adjustments for confounders, Asian females had the lowest adjusted 90-day mortality (OR=0.656, 95% CI=0.385-1.118, p<0.001 compared to White males). Similarly, compared to White males, African-American males had a lower adjusted mortality (OR=0.790, 95% CI=0.648-0.963, p = 0.019), while Asian males (OR=1.185, 95% CI=0. 828-1.696, p = 0.354) and both African-American (OR=0.972, 95% CI=0.800-1.182, p = 0.779) and Caucasian (OR=1.054, 95% CI=0.960-1.158, p = 0.270) females had similar mortality. Both male and female patients with Other/unknown race had higher mortality (OR=1.776, 95% CI=1.395-2.261, p<0.001 and OR=1.658, 95% CI=1.359-2.021, p<0.001), respectively. In the secondary analyses for new-onset mechanical ventilation and new-onset renal replacement therapy post-sepsis, we found no association between any of the race-sex groups and receipt of these therapies. CONCLUSION: We found that Asian females had the lowest adjusted 90-day mortality for patients with sepsis.

929,"There has been a significant evolution in the definition and management of sepsis over the last three decades. This is driven in part due to the advances made in our understanding of its pathophysiology. There is evidence to show that the manifestations of sepsis can no longer be attributed only to the infectious agent and the immune response it engenders, but also to significant alterations in coagulation, immunosuppression, and organ dysfunction. A revolutionary change in the way we manage sepsis has been the adoption of early goal-directed therapy. This involves the early identification of at-risk patients and prompt treatment with antibiotics, hemodynamic optimization, and appropriate supportive care. This has contributed significantly to the overall improved outcomes with sepsis. Investigation into clinically relevant biomarkers of sepsis are ongoing and have yet to yield effective results. Scoring systems such as the sequential organ failure assessment and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation help risk-stratify patients with sepsis. Advances in precision medicine techniques and the development of targeted therapy directed at limiting the excesses of the inflammatory and coagulatory cascades offer potentially viable avenues for future research. This review summarizes the progress made in the diagnosis and management of sepsis over the past two decades and examines promising avenues for future research.",0
930,"IMPORTANCE Definitions of sepsis and septic shock were last revised in 2001. Considerable advances have since been made into the pathobiology (changes in organ function, morphology, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation), management, and epidemiology of sepsis, suggesting the need for reexamination. OBJECTIVE To evaluate and, as needed, update definitions for sepsis and septic shock. PROCESS A task force (n = 19) with expertise in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were generated through meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health record databases, and voting, followed by circulation to international professional societies, requesting peer review and endorsement (by 31 societies listed in the Acknowledgment). KEY FINDINGS FROMEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Limitations of previous definitions included an excessive focus on inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum through severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions and terminologies are currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in reported incidence and observed mortality. The task force concluded the term severe sepsis was redundant. RECOMMENDATIONS Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical operationalization, organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more, which is associated with an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%. Septic shock should be defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%. In out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as being more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least 2 of the following clinical criteria that together constitute a new bedside clinical score termed quickSOFA (qSOFA): respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These updated definitions and clinical criteria should replace previous definitions, offer greater consistency for epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, and facilitate earlier recognition and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing sepsis.",0
931,"Background There is a growing concern about artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare that can disadvantage already under-represented and marginalised groups (eg, based on gender or race). Objectives Our objectives are to canvas the range of strategies stakeholders endorse in attempting to mitigate algorithmic bias, and to consider the ethical question of responsibility for algorithmic bias. Methodology The study involves in-depth, semistructured interviews with healthcare workers, screening programme managers, consumer health representatives, regulators, data scientists and developers. Results Findings reveal considerable divergent views on three key issues. First, views on whether bias is a problem in healthcare AI varied, with most participants agreeing bias is a problem (which we call the bias-critical view), a small number believing the opposite (the bias-denial view), and some arguing that the benefits of AI outweigh any harms or wrongs arising from the bias problem (the bias-apologist view). Second, there was a disagreement on the strategies to mitigate bias, and who is responsible for such strategies. Finally, there were divergent views on whether to include or exclude sociocultural identifiers (eg, race, ethnicity or gender-diverse identities) in the development of AI as a way to mitigate bias. Conclusion/significance Based on the views of participants, we set out responses that stakeholders might pursue, including greater interdisciplinary collaboration, tailored stakeholder engagement activities, empirical studies to understand algorithmic bias and strategies to modify dominant approaches in AI development such as the use of participatory methods, and increased diversity and inclusion in research teams and research participant recruitment and selection.",0
932,"The annual incidences of severe sepsis in several industrialized nations have recently been reported to be 50-100 cases per 100,000 persons. These numbers exceed the estimated rates for other diseases that hold a heightened public awareness, including breast cancer and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. There are also sex and race differences in the incidence of sepsis. Men are more likely than women to develop sepsis, with a mean annual relative risk of 1.28. Nonwhites are nearly twice as likely to develop sepsis as whites. These race and sex disparities in the incidence of sepsis are likely explained by differences in a variety of factors, including the presence of comorbid conditions. For example, chronic alcohol abuse is associated with a persistent fever, delayed resolution of symptoms, increased rates of bacteremia, increased use of intensive care, prolonged duration of hospital stay, and increased cost of hospitalization for infected patients.",0
933,"Background/Objectives The objective of this study is to investigate potential racial disparities in time to antibiotics among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with severe sepsis or septic shock. Methods This was a retrospective observational study of adults > 18 years with severe sepsis or septic shock presenting to a large, urban, academic ED and admitted to the ICU from 10/2005 to 2/2012. Time to antibiotic data was abstracted by ICU research staff; other data were abstracted by blinded trained research assistants using standardized abstraction forms. Time from ED arrival to antibiotics was compared in white vs. non-white patients using cumulative events curves followed by Cox proportional hazards regression, controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, source of infection, and SOFA score. Results Seven hundred sixty-eight patients were included; 19.5 % (n = 150) were non-white. Median minutes to antibiotics was 131 in white patients vs. 158 in non-white patients (p = 0.03, log-rank test). The unadjusted hazard ratio for non-white patients was 0.82 (95 %CI 0.58–0.98). After adjustment, the hazard ratio for race was not significant (0.90, 95 %CI 0.73–1.10). Conclusions In a single-center sample of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, adjustment for factors including age and infectious source eliminated the difference in time to antibiotics by race. Further research should investigate disparities in sepsis care between hospitals with differing patient populations.",0

We used Dynamic Bayesian Networks, a temporal probabilistic technique to model a system whose state changes over time. We built, trained and tested the model using data of 3,100 patients admitted to the emergency department, and measured the accuracy of detecting sepsis using data collected within the first 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours after admission. The area under the curve was 0.911, 0.915, 0.937 and 0.944 respectively. We describe the data, data preparation techniques, model, results, various statistical measures and the limitations of our experiments. We also briefly discuss techniques to improve accuracy, and the generalizability of our methods to other diseases.",0
939,"Purpose To investigate the global burden of sepsis in hospitalized adults by updating and expanding a systematic review and meta-analysis and to compare findings with recent Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) sepsis estimates. Methods Thirteen electronic databases were searched for studies on population-level sepsis incidence defined according to clinical criteria (Sepsis-1, -2: severe sepsis criteria, or sepsis-3: sepsis criteria) or relevant ICD-codes. The search of the original systematic review was updated for studies published 05/2015–02/2019 and complemented by a search targeting low- or middle-income-country (LMIC) studies published 01/1979–02/2019. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis with incidence of hospital- and ICU-treated sepsis and proportion of deaths among these sepsis cases as outcomes. Results Of 4746 results, 28 met the inclusion criteria. 21 studies contributed data for the meta-analysis and were pooled with 30 studies from the original meta-analysis. Pooled incidence was 189 [95% CI 133, 267] hospital-treated sepsis cases per 100,000 person-years. An estimated 26.7% [22.9, 30.7] of sepsis patients died. Estimated incidence of ICU-treated sepsis was 58 [42, 81] per 100,000 person-years, of which 41.9% [95% CI 36.2, 47.7] died prior to hospital discharge. There was a considerably higher incidence of hospital-treated sepsis observed after 2008 (+ 46% compared to the overall time frame). Conclusions Compared to results from the IHME study, we found an approximately 50% lower incidence of hospital-treated sepsis. The majority of studies included were based on administrative data, thus limiting our ability to assess temporal trends and regional differences. The incidence of sepsis remains unknown for the vast majority of LMICs, highlighting the urgent need for improved epidemiological sepsis surveillance.

941,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has an astonishing potential in assisting clinical decision making and revolutionizing the field of health care. A major open challenge that AI will need to address before its integration in the clinical routine is that of algorithmic bias. Most AI algorithms need big datasets to learn from, but several groups of the human population have a long history of being absent or misrepresented in existing biomedical datasets. If the training data is misrepresentative of the population variability, AI is prone to reinforcing bias, which can lead to fatal outcomes, misdiagnoses, and lack of generalization. Here, we describe the challenges in rendering AI algorithms fairer, and we propose concrete steps for addressing bias using tools from the field of open science.",0
942,"Background Clinician trust in machine learning–based clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) for predicting in-hospital deterioration (a type of predictive CDSS) is essential for adoption. Evidence shows that clinician trust in predictive CDSSs is influenced by perceived understandability and perceived accuracy. Objective The aim of this study was to explore the phenomenon of clinician trust in predictive CDSSs for in-hospital deterioration by confirming and characterizing factors known to influence trust (understandability and accuracy), uncovering and describing other influencing factors, and comparing nurses’ and prescribing providers’ trust in predictive CDSSs. Methods We followed a qualitative descriptive methodology conducting directed deductive and inductive content analysis of interview data. Directed deductive analyses were guided by the human-computer trust conceptual framework. Semistructured interviews were conducted with nurses and prescribing providers (physicians, physician assistants, or nurse practitioners) working with a predictive CDSS at 2 hospitals in Mass General Brigham. Results A total of 17 clinicians were interviewed. Concepts from the human-computer trust conceptual framework—perceived understandability and perceived technical competence (ie, perceived accuracy)—were found to influence clinician trust in predictive CDSSs for in-hospital deterioration. The concordance between clinicians’ impressions of patients’ clinical status and system predictions influenced clinicians’ perceptions of system accuracy. Understandability was influenced by system explanations, both global and local, as well as training. In total, 3 additional themes emerged from the inductive analysis. The first, perceived actionability, captured the variation in clinicians’ desires for predictive CDSSs to recommend a discrete action. The second, evidence, described the importance of both macro- (scientific) and micro- (anecdotal) evidence for fostering trust. The final theme, equitability, described fairness in system predictions. The findings were largely similar between nurses and prescribing providers. Conclusions Although there is a perceived trade-off between machine learning–based CDSS accuracy and understandability, our findings confirm that both are important for fostering clinician trust in predictive CDSSs for in-hospital deterioration. We found that reliance on the predictive CDSS in the clinical workflow may influence clinicians’ requirements for trust. Future research should explore the impact of reliance, the optimal explanation design for enhancing understandability, and the role of perceived actionability in driving trust.",0
943,"Translating machine learning (ML) models effectively to clinical practice requires establishing clinicians’ trust. Explainability, or the ability of an ML model to justify its outcomes and assist clinicians in rationalizing the model prediction, has been generally understood to be critical to establishing trust. However, the eld suffers from the lack of concrete definitions for usable explanations in different settings. To identify specific aspects of explainability that may catalyze building trust in ML models, we surveyed clinicians from two distinct acute care specialties (Intenstive Care Unit and Emergency Department). We use their feedback to characterize when explainability helps to improve clinicians’ trust in ML models. We further identify the classes of explanations that clinicians identified as most relevant and crucial for effective translation to clinical practice. Finally, we discern concrete metrics for rigorous evaluation of clinical explainability methods. By integrating perceptions of explainability between clinicians and ML researchers we hope to facilitate the endorsement and broader adoption and sustained use of ML systems in healthcare.",0

945,"Background and objectives: Serum creatinine concentrations tend to be higher in black than white individuals and people of other races or ethnicities. These differences have been assumed to be largely related to race-related differences in body composition, especially muscle mass., Design, setting, participants, & measurements: In a diverse population of hemodialysis patients, we compared mean serum creatinine concentrations in black versus nonblack patients, adjusting for case mix (age, gender, diabetes, and dialysis vintage), body size (height, weight), laboratory parameters of nutritional status (albumin, predialysis blood urea nitrogen, transferrin, phosphorus, glucose), dialysis dosage (urea reduction ratio), and parameters of bioelectrical impedance (resistance and reactance), proxies for body composition., Results: Adjusted mean serum creatinine concentrations were significantly higher in black versus nonblack patients (11.7 versus 10.0 mg/dl; P < 0.0001). Black patients were roughly four-fold more likely to have a serum creatinine concentration >10 mg/dl and six-fold more likely to have a serum creatinine concentration >15 mg/dl. Higher serum creatinine concentrations were associated with a lower relative risk for death (0.93; 95% confidence interval 0.88 to 0.98 per mg/dl); the association was slightly more pronounced among nonblack patients., Conclusions: Serum creatinine concentrations are significantly higher in black compared with nonblack hemodialysis patients; these differences are not readily explained by differences in nutritional status or body composition.",0

The CSC adopted by US states ration intensive care unit (ICU) admission using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, which is used to compare expected in-hospital mortality among eligible patients. However, it is unknown if Black and White patients with equivalent SOFA scores have equivalent in-hospital mortality.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To investigate whether reliance on SOFA is associated with bias against Black patients in CSC.</p><h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3><p>This cohort study was conducted using data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database of patients admitted to 233 US ICUs in 2014 to 2015. Included individuals were Black and White adult patients in the ICU, who were followed up to hospital discharge. Data were analyzed from May 2020 through April 2021.</p><h3>Exposure</h3><p>SOFA scores at ICU admission.</p><h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3><p>Hierarchical logistic regression with hospital fixed effects was used to measure the interaction between race and SOFA as a factor associated with in-hospital mortality, as well as the odds of death among Black and White patients with equivalent priority for resource allocation according to the SOFA-based ranking rules of 3 statewide CSC (denoted A, B, and C) under shortage conditions that were severe (ie, only patients with the highest priority would be eligible for allocation), intermediate (ie, patients in the highest 2 tiers would be eligible for allocation), or low (ie, only patients with the lowest priority would be at risk of exclusion).</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Among 111 885 ICU encounters representing 95 549 patients, there were 16 688 encounters with Black patients (14.9%) and 51 464 (46.0%) encounters with women and the mean (SD) age was 63.3 (16.9) years. The median (interquartile range) SOFA score was not statistically significantly different between Black and White patients (4 [2-6] for both groups;<i>P</i> = .19), but mortality was lower among Black individuals compared with White individuals with equivalent SOFA scores (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). This was associated with lower mortality among Black patients compared with White patients prioritized for resource allocation in 3 CSC under shortage conditions that were severe (system A: OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.58-0.74;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; system B: OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64-0.78;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; system C: OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67-0.80;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), intermediate (system A: OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67-0.80;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; system B: OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.89;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; system C: OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.77-0.89;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and low (system A: OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.89;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; system C: OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.92;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; not applicable for system B, which had fewer tiers). When SOFA-based ranking rules were adjusted for Black patients to simulate equitable allocation based on observed mortality, the proportion upgraded to higher priority ranged from 379 Black patient encounters (2.3%) in low shortage conditions to 2601 Black patient encounters (15.6%) in severe shortage conditions.</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>This study found that SOFA scores were associated with overestimated mortality among Black patients compared with White patients, and this was associated with a structural disadvantage for Black patients in CSC allocation systems. These findings suggest that guidelines should be revised to correct this inequity and alternative methods should be developed for more equitable triage.</p>",0
948,"This article traces the media representation of nursing strikes in the United States through evolving newspaper, television, online news, and social media coverage of three historical case studies: the nationally-record-setting nurses’ strikes in 1984 (Minneapolis-St. Paul), 2010 (Minneapolis-St. Paul), and 2014 (Kaiser Permanente hospitals, California). Over time, American nursing unions grew increasingly diverse by gender, socio-economic, and racial/ethnic composition. At the same time, media coverage of nurses’ strikes remained dependent upon well-worn gendered narratives of nursing as essentialized female caring that undermined the evolving aims of their collective professional and labour interests. Nursing unions initially benefited from their depiction as young, mostly white, middle-class women seeking fairness for their relatively low-paid work. However, deep contradictions persist in the public understanding of gender, labour, and professionalism in nursing, which have been compounded rather than clarified by its static and often nostalgic representation of nurses in the media.",0

In this paper we analyze the effects of nurses' strikes in hospitals on patient outcomes. We utilize a unique dataset collected on nurses' strikes over the 1984 to 2004 period in New York State, and match these strikes to a restricted use hospital discharge database which provides information on treatment intensity, patient mortality and hospital readmission. Controlling for hospital specific heterogeneity, patient demographics and disease severity, the results show that nurses' strikes increase in-hospital mortality by 19.4% and 30-day readmission by 6.5% for patients admitted during a strike, with little change in patient demographics, disease severity or treatment intensity.

981,"Pediatric sepsis is a heterogeneous disease with varying physiological dynamics associated with recovery, disability, and mortality.

We analyzed 18,666 illness state transitions over 157 pediatric intensive care unit admissions in the 3 days following blood cultures for suspected sepsis. We used Shannon entropy to quantify the differences in transition matrices stratified by clinical characteristics. The population-based transition matrix based on the sepsis illness severity scores in the days following a sepsis diagnosis can describe a sepsis illness trajectory.

987,"Background Formal and informal medical curricula convey expectations about professionalization, that is, the development of physician identity, and also about professionalism. This study examined whether, in general, junior residents experienced any dissonance between these roles and focused particularly on how they negotiated conflicts between compassion, self-care, duty and medical expertise. Methods In 2015, purposive sampling was used to select 21 first-year residents at a Canadian medical school. Participants listened to a 5-min audio-recording narrated in either male or female voice. Facing compassion fatigue after three obstetrical disasters over less than 2 days the resident narrator asks to go home. Participants reacted in writing to questions about this request and relevant teaching/modelling. Responses were analyzed using a qualitative, exploratory, thematic research design. Results Four themes were identified: i) empathy, self-doubt and fear of weakness, ii) the need for support from and communication with physicians and others, iii) education received, and iv) professionalization outranks professionalism. Participants agreed that under the circumstances the narrator’s care, compassion and request were appropriate. Never the less, many grappled with feeling that asking to be relieved of work demonstrated weakness and a shirking of responsibility. Respondents had received no formal teaching about balancing compassion for patients or self with professional duty. Preceptors’ informal teaching and modeling valorized scientific disengagement above all else. What emerged was participants’ drive to become detached clinicians who set aside emotional responses and interactions that could impede and be incompatible with professionalization. However, participants also recognized and lamented what was lost in such a transformation. Conclusion In the transition from student to practitioner, trainees’ views and the modeling they receive shift emotion and compassion, whether for self or patients, from assets to liabilities as they aim to be invincible medical experts.",0
988,"Economic constraints, profound changes in the healthcare system and insufficient educational expertise have gripped medical education. The objective of this study was to review professionalization of medical education and to contribute to an elaboration of a conceptual framework for understanding reforms. We developed a concept map based on information retrieved by searching the Medline/Knowledge Finder and the Cochrane Library databases. The descriptors used for the searches were 'certification, credentialing, education, faculty medical, quality assurance health care, research, staff development, teaching'. The endpoints for the study were: frequency, quality of studies and propositional content with regard to professionalization for developing a concept map. Thirty-one relevant studies were found in Medline.The Cochrane Library search returned no relevant studies. The evidence of the few studies was weak. The literature-derived concept map shows that faculty development is a prerequisite for certification leading to professionalization. Other related variables were resource allocation, intrinsic motivation to learn, educational research, study time, financial policy, organizational and staff development, and new specialized roles such as clinician-educator. It is concluded that professionalization of medical education is needed. This deficit underscores the need for conceptually sound research approaches. The concept of intrinsic motivation explains how to comply with scientifically based standards, thus fostering professionality. Approaches facilitating compliance, such as evidence-based learning, potentially professionalize the practice of medical education.

This inevitably raises questions about their role-related obligations and whether they should be free to choose not to endanger themselves.

1018,"Aims and Objectives This study used census data to construct a demographic profile of early 20th century nurses in the United States. Background Census data is recognized as a rich source of quantitative information on long term changes. However, difficulties in retrieving census data dissuade researchers from exploiting this source. IPUMS, a standardized and digitialized version of census data, enables greater ease in retrieving and analyzing data. Design and Methods A sample of respondents identifying as “professional nurses” for the years 1900–1950 was extracted from IPUMS categorized by the variables of race, sex, and marital status. The resulting data set was analyzed for simple frequency statistics using SPSS software. Findings Results revealed a tremendous increase in the number of nurses over the five decades under study. Nurses were increasingly young, female, single and white until 1930. After 1930, white and African-American women nurses began to reflect trends toward more diversity. Discussion and Conclusions This study is the first systematic attempt to trace the demographic trajectory of professional nurses in the United States in the early 20th century. It also demonstrates the possibilities of using digital technologies to restructure the asking and answering of historical questions. The use of quantitative methods of social history has transnational applications which can facilitate global investigations into the demographic composition of the nursing occupation. Relevance for Clinical Practice This way of using digitalization of census data provides a way to examine historical trans-national workforce trends. Such trends provide a firmer base upon which to construct workforce and practice strategies for a future global workforce.",0

This inevitably raises questions about their role-related obligations and whether they should be free to choose not to endanger themselves. In this article, I argue that it is helpful to view this situation not only through the lens of “professional duty” but also through the lens of “role-related conflicts.” Doing so has the advantage of avoiding exceptionalism and allowing us to draw lessons not only from previous epidemics but also from a wide range of far more common role-related dilemmas in healthcare.",0

1045,"Background and objective Different regulatory requirements apply for clinical research activities, thus identifying the applicable regulatory requirements is one of the cornerstones of regulatory compliance. Typically, classification is a very manual and time-consuming process. To make the classification more efficient, precise and dynamic, we proposed to automate the classification process using an advanced Machine Learning algorithm which follows a set of logical decision steps. The main objective of the project was to prove or reject the hypothesis of whether a Machine Learning model can be trained to automatically classify clinical research. Methods Multiple Machine Learning models based on Natural Language Processing Classifiers including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression were trained to classify Interventional Clinical Trials, Non-interventional Studies and other Real-world evidence research activities based on the text extracted from a Research Plan or a Study Protocol/Synopsis. Starting with Data Exploration and Data Preparation, for Data Preprocessing, the Term Frequency-Inversed Document Frequency (Tf-idf) column transformation was performed. To assess the performance of the models and choose the most efficient one, the accuracy, precision, recall (also known as sensitivity) and f1-score were calculated for each model. Results All models showed sufficient performance. However, the Random Forest Classification model outperformed the other solutions tested and therefore was implemented in our Machine Learning application. The hypothesis was accepted based on a recall score of 1.00 as well as a 0.94 accuracy. The probability score of the result was analysed from the perspective of prioritisation of compliance needs minimising the false negatives for interventional and non-interventional studies. This Machine Learning model was then applied directly to achieve successful Clinical Research classification. Conclusion Thus, we have demonstrated that the implementation of the Machine Learning approach helps in the acceleration of the classification process and at the same time increasing compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. This model can benefit the biopharmaceutical industry and individual researchers.",0

1047,"Patients’ no-shows, scheduled but unattended medical appointments, have a direct negative impact on patients’ health, due to discontinuity of treatment and late presentation to care. They also lead to inefficient use of medical resources in hospitals and clinics. The ability to predict a likely no-show in advance could enable the design and implementation of interventions to reduce the risk of it happening, thus improving patients’ care and clinical resource allocation. In this study, we develop a new interpretable deep learning-based approach for predicting the risk of no-shows at the time when a medical appointment is first scheduled. The retrospective study was conducted in an academic pediatric teaching hospital with a 20% no-show rate. Our approach tackles several challenges in the design of a predictive model by (1) adopting a data imputation method for patients with missing information in their records (77% of the population), (2) exploiting local weather information to improve predictive accuracy, and (3) developing an interpretable approach that explains how a prediction is made for each individual patient. Our proposed neural network-based and logistic regression-based methods outperformed persistence baselines. In an unobserved set of patients, our method correctly identified 83% of no-shows at the time of scheduling and led to a false alert rate less than 17%. Our method is capable of producing meaningful predictions even when some information in a patient’s records is missing. We find that patients’ past no-show record is the strongest predictor. Finally, we discuss several potential interventions to reduce no-shows, such as scheduling appointments of high-risk patients at off-peak times, which can serve as starting point for further studies on no-show interventions.",0
1048,"OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and examine the psychometric properties of established resilience scales in older adults, i.e. ≥60 years. METHODS: A systematic review of Scopus and Web of Science databases was undertaken using the search strategy ""resilience"" AND (ageing OR aging)"". Independent title/abstract and fulltext screening were undertaken, identifying original peer-reviewed English articles that conducted psychometric validation studies of resilience metrics in samples aged ≥60 years. Data on the reliability/validity of the included metrics were extracted from primary studies. RESULTS: Five thousand five hundred nine studies were identified by the database search, 426 used resilience psychometrics, and six psychometric analysis studies were included in the final analysis. These studies conducted analyses of the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and its shortened 10-item version (CD-RISC10), the Resilience Scale (RS) and its shortened 5- (RS-5) and 11- (RS-11) item versions, and the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS). All scales demonstrated acceptable levels of internal consistency, convergent/discriminant validity and theoretical construct validity. Factor structures for the RS, RS-11 and CD-RISC diverged from the structures in the original studies. CONCLUSION: The RS, RS-5, RS-11, CD-RISC, CD-RISC10 and BRCS demonstrate psychometric robustness adequate for continued use in older populations. However, results from the current study and pre-existing theoretical construct validity studies most strongly support the use of the RS, with modest and preliminary support for the CD-RISC and BRCS, respectively.

1049,"Background: While resilience has been defined as resistance to illness, adaptation, and thriving, the ability to bounce back or recover from stress is closest to its original meaning. Previous resilience measures assess resources that may promote resilience rather than recovery, resistance, adaptation, or thriving. Purpose: To test a new brief resilience scale. Method: The brief resilience scale (BRS) was created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. Its psychometric characteristics were examined in four samples, including two student samples and samples with cardiac and chronic pain patients. Results: The BRS was reliable and measured as a unitary construct. It was predictably related to personal characteristics, social relations, coping, and health in all samples. It was negatively related to anxiety, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms when other resilience measures and optimism, social support, and Type D personality (high negative affect and high social inhibition) were controlled. There were large differences in BRS scores between cardiac patients with and without Type D and women with and without fibromyalgia.

1053,"Research on loneliness has been hampered by its strong association with depression. The 2 states frequently co-occur, and measures of the 2 states are substantially correlated. Inability to manipulate experimentally loneliness or depression makes it difficult to untangle the causal influence of one on the other. The combination of longitudinal design and structural equation methodology is proposed as a solution to this general problem. Measures of loneliness and depression (e.g., the Beck Depression Inventory and Profile of Mood States) were administered to undergraduates at 2 points 5 wks apart. Data from 333 Ss were correlated and analyzed under a succession of structural equation models. Results indicate that loneliness and depression were correlated but clearly different constructs; neither was a direct cause of the other, although both probably share some common origins; both were highly stable over the 5-wk period.

1054,"Nearly all older adults experience social losses, which can disrupt their social support networks and impair their quality of life. Events such as retirement, an inability to drive, death of a spouse and/or close life-long friends, or moving to an elder care facility may negatively affect the quality of older adults' social support networks. Low levels of perceived social support are associated with increased depression, impaired immune functioning and reduced life expectancy. Moreover, social interactions can be cognitively stimulating and may help older adults preserve their cognitive abilities. In the present study, institutionalized older adults were exposed to either a cognitive enhancement programme designed to enhance social networks or a control group. Measures of perceived social support and loneliness were administered before and after a 3-month, group-based intervention. There was a significant interaction between group and time. Those who did not participate in the intervention experienced a decrease in perceived social support and an increase in perceived loneliness. Participants in the intervention group stayed the same on the above measures. Helping older adults increase or maintain the quality of their social networks may lead to enhanced cognitive functioning, decreased depression and improved quality of life. Recommendations to help assisted living facilities, nursing homes, retirement communities and senior centres develop social and cognitive interventions are provided.",0
1055,"OBJECTIVES: To determine associations between use of three different modes of social contact (in person, telephone, written or e-mail), contact with different types of people, and risk of depressive symptoms in a nationally representative, longitudinal sample of older adults. DESIGN: Population-based observational cohort. SETTING: Urban and suburban communities throughout the contiguous United States. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 50 and older who participated in the Health and Retirement Survey between 2004 and 2010 (N = 11,065). MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of participant use of the three modes of social contact with children, other family members, and friends at baseline were used to predict depressive symptoms (measured using the eight-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) 2 years later using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Probability of having depressive symptoms steadily increased as frequency of in-person-but not telephone or written or e-mail contact-decreased. After controlling for demographic, clinical, and social variables, individuals with in-person social contact every few months or less with children, other family, and friends had a significantly higher probability of clinically significant depressive symptoms 2 years later (11.5%) than those having in-person contact once or twice per month (8.1%; P < .001) or once or twice per week (7.3%; P < .001). Older age, interpersonal conflict, and depression at baseline moderated some of the effects of social contact on depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: Frequency of in-person social contact with friends and family independently predicts risk of subsequent depression in older adults. Clinicians should consider encouraging face-to-face social interactions as a preventive strategy for depression.",0

Analyses were conducted using SPSS macros for estimating the indirect effects through multiple mediators. Participants who experienced the loss of loved ones in life reported statistically significantly higher life dissatisfaction scores than those who reported no such loss. The effects of loss on perceived life dissatisfaction were partially mediated by individual connectedness and satisfaction with received social support but not by support network size or collective connectedness. Interventions with older adults who experienced loss in life need to help alleviate their loneliness and increase their satisfaction with social support.",0
1057,"Background: Previous research found poverty to be associated with adverse health outcomes among older adults but the factors that translate low economic resources into poor physical health are not well understood. The goal of this analysis was to assess the impact of material, psychosocial, and behavioural factors as well as education in explaining the poverty-health link. Methods: In total, 28 360 observations from 11 390 community-dwelling respondents (65+) in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (2004-13, 10 countries) were analysed. Multilevel growth curve models were used to assess the impact of combined income and asset poverty risk on old-age frailty (frailty index) and associated pathway variables. Results: In total, 61.8% of the variation of poverty risk on frailty level was explained by direct and indirect effects. Results stress the role of material and particularly psychosocial factors such as perceived control and social isolation, whereas the role of health behaviour was negligible. Conclusion: We suggest to strengthen social policy and public health efforts in order to fight poverty and its deleterious health effects from early age on as well as to broaden the scope of interventions with regard to psychosocial factors.",0
1058,"BACKGROUND: Large amounts of time spent alone by older people have been associated with loneliness and poor mental and physical health. There is a paucity of research, however, that examines time alone from an occupational perspective. In this exploratory study we explored the perspectives of older people on their time spent alone. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study design was selected. With the aim of maximising variation, five participants were recruited from retirement villages and seven participants who lived independently in the community. Participants recorded time spent alone in a time diary for three days as priming for a semi-structured in-depth interview. Transcripts were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Three key themes were identified: 'it is a matter of getting some balance'; 'keeping busy'; and 'the nights are the worst'. The study highlights the importance older people place on the need to manage time alone so that it is a positive and nourishing experience and to avoid experiencing extended periods of boredom potentially leading to loneliness. Older people utilise occupations to keep busy and achieve an individually acceptable level of time alone. CONCLUSION: Enabling older people to balance time spent alone by addressing barriers to participation in the community in addition to finding engaging occupations to occupy time has the potential to prevent boredom, loneliness and improve wellbeing.",0
1059,"BACKGROUND: This paper reports on the feasibility and outcomes of a transition to retirement programme for older adults with disability.

There were 42 men and 16 women with a mean age of 55.6 years While attending their individual mainstream community group 1 day per week, intervention group participants received support from community group members trained as mentors. We assessed participants' loneliness, social satisfaction, depression, life events, quality of life, community participation, social contacts, and work hours before and 6 months after joining a community group. RESULTS: Twenty-five (86%) of the intervention group attended their community group weekly for at least 6 months. They increased their community participation, made an average of four new social contacts and decreased their work hours. Intervention participants were more socially satisfied post-intervention than comparison group members.

This exploratory study sought to discover how the dynamics between the generations have evolved and the positive and negative impact of such changes. The voices of the retirees in this study shed light on the complicating issues surrounding communication as a lifeline between generations of Deaf people who are native users of American Sign Language.

1061,"BACKGROUND: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. METHODS: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. RESULTS: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. CONCLUSION: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group.",0
1062,"Palliative care demonstrably improves quality of life for the seriously ill in a manner that averts preventable health crises and their associated costs. Because of these outcomes, palliative care is now broadening its reach beyond hospitals, and hospice care for those near death, to patients and their families living in the community with chronic multimorbidities that have uncertain or long expected survival. In this article, we address research needed to enable policies supportive of palliative care access and quality, including changes in regulatory, accreditation, financing, and training approaches in the purview of policy makers. Mr. K. is an 86-year-old male with multimorbidities, including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation therapy. He fell in his mobile home and was unable to reach the telephone to call for help. Six hours later, his neighbor found him lying on the bedroom floor in pain and confused, and called 911. On examination, he was found to have a cold blue foot complicated by a large hematoma. The vascular surgery service was consulted to evaluate Mr. K. for revascularization or amputation. Although Mr. K. had several risk factors complicating his candidacy for general anesthesia, the team thought the benefits of surgery would outweigh the risks. Mr. K's daughter agreed to surgery telling her father ""the doctors know best."" Mr. K. replied ""I just want to be out of pain."" Six months later, Mr. K. remains in a skilled nursing facility due to post-op complications, including pneumonia, worsened confusion, and the inability to recover to enough function to live safely at home. He now suffers from depression, cognitive deficits, and social isolation. His daughter has had to take on a second job because she is struggling to pay for his continued long-term care, which costs $6000 per month. Money she had saved for her own retirement and her daughter's college tuition is already gone. In retrospect, she realizes the surgical team did not discuss the possibility of his survival with chronic debility and long-term functional dependency, nor the fact that Medicare would not pay for the care he now requires.",0
1063,"Caregiving in the last years of life is associated with increased depression and negative health outcomes for surviving spouses, many of whom are themselves in poor health. Yet it is unclear how often spouses are caregiving alone, how they differ from supported spouses, and whether lack of support affects postbereavement outcomes. We hypothesized that spouses who were solo caregivers-that is, the only caregivers (paid or unpaid) who provided assistance with a spouse's self-care or household activities-would experience more depression after bereavement than supported spouses would. Using information from the Health and Retirement Study, we found that 55 percent of the spouses of community-dwelling married people with disability were solo caregivers. Solo caregiving was even common among people who cared for spouses with dementia and those with adult children living close by. Bereavement outcomes did not differ between solo and supported caregiving spouses. Caregiving spouses are often isolated and may benefit from greater support, particularly during the final years before bereavement. While some state and federal policy proposals aim to systematically recognize and assess caregivers, further innovations in care delivery and reimbursement are needed to adequately support seriously ill older adults and their caregivers. Ultimately, the focus of serious illness care must be expanded from the patient to the family unit.",0
1064,"Although participating in community social programming is associated with positive physical and mental health outcomes for older adults, older men participate less often than women. Men's Sheds is a community programme used primarily by older men that originated in Australia and is well established there. The goal of the current study was to explore men's perceptions of the need for Men's Sheds and issues concerning access to them in Canada, a country with a small but growing Men's Sheds movement. We conducted focus groups with 64 men aged 55 years and older, including Men's Sheds members and men from the community who were unfamiliar with this programme, and analysed the data using the framework analytic approach. The data revealed two primary themes concerning: (a) the need for male-focused community programmes, including the sub-themes reducing isolation, forming friendships and engaging in continued learning; and (b) access to programmes, including the sub-themes points of contact, sustaining attendance and barriers. Findings suggest that in order to reduce the likelihood of isolation and increase opportunities for social engagement, exposure to the concept of male-focused programming should begin before retirement age. In addition, such programmes should be mindful of how they are branded and marketed in order to create spaces that are welcoming to new and diverse members.",0
1065,"OBJECTIVE: 1. Examine the relationship between household wealth, social participation and loneliness among older people across Europe. 2. Investigate whether relationships vary by type of social participation (charity/volunteer work, sports/social clubs, educational/training course, and political/community organisations) and gender. 3. Examine whether social participation moderates the association between wealth and loneliness. METHODS: Data (N=29,795) were taken from the fifth wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), which was collected during 2013 from 14 European countries. Loneliness was measured using the short version of the Revised-University of California, Los Angeles (R-UCLA) Loneliness Scale. We used multilevel logistic models stratified by gender to examine the relationships between variables, with individuals nested within countries. RESULTS: The risk of loneliness was highest in the least wealthy groups and lowest in the wealthiest groups. Frequent social participation was associated with a lower risk of loneliness and moderated the association between household wealth and loneliness, particularly among men. Compared to the wealthiest men who often took part in formal social activities, the least wealthy men who did not participate had greater risk of loneliness (OR=1.91, 95% CI: 1.44 to 2.51). This increased risk was not observed among the least wealthy men who reported frequent participation in formal social activities (OR=1.12, 95% CI: 0.76 to 1.67). CONCLUSION: Participation in external social activities may help to reduce loneliness among older adults and potentially acts as a buffer against the adverse effects of socioeconomic disadvantage.",0
1066,"This article presents findings from an annual program survey of residents of a horizontal neighborhood naturally occurring retirement community (NNORC). The study explored the relationship between several factors (age, co-residents, number of chronic illnesses, self-reported health, loneliness, sense of mastery, locus of control, pain, and psychological distress) and their ability to predict general health, level of psychological distress, and the quantity and type of help-seeking behaviors. Although residents generally reported moderate to high levels of chronic disease, pain, loneliness, and concerns about life issues, 25% of them sought no help from any of the listed resources, and 65% sought help from only one of seven resources. The most common source of help for most (70%) was a primary care physician (PCP), and comparatively few respondents sought help from other sources. Older adults, especially those with chronic illness, generally consider their PCP to be the first, and perhaps only, source to consult. However, research indicates that the most effective health promotional programs for older adults are social and educational group activities, rather than individual health-focused interventions. Possible means of redirecting residents toward NNORC services include more vigorous outreach and creating collaborative partnerships between local PCPs serving older populations and the NNORC.",0
1067,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a home-based and volunteer-administered physical training and nutritional intervention program compared with social support intervention on nutritional and frailty status in prefrail and frail community-dwelling older persons. DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled trial in which community-dwelling persons (mean age = 83 years) were recruited and randomly assigned to the physical training and nutritional intervention group (PTN, n = 39) and the social support group (SoSu, n = 41). The study was conducted by trained lay nonprofessionals. SETTING: The community-dwelling older persons in both groups were visited twice a week by trained nonprofessional volunteers (buddies) in Vienna, Austria. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty prefrail and frail adults aged 65 years or older. INTERVENTION: In the PTN group, both the buddies and older persons performed 6 strength exercises within a circuit training session and discussed nutrition-related aspects. The active control group (SoSu) had the opportunity to perform cognitive training in addition to the social contact. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measures as nutritional (Mini Nutritional Assessment long form [MNA-LF]) and frailty status (Frailty Instrument for Primary Care of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe [SHARE-FI]) were obtained at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: Significant improvements in the MNA-LF score (1.54 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-2.56; P = .004) and the SHARE-FI score (-0.71 discrete factor score values, 95% CI -1.07, -0.35; P < .001) were observed in the PTN group after 12 weeks. In both groups, the prevalence of impaired nutritional status and frailty decreased significantly over time. The prevalence of impaired nutritional status decreased by 25% in the PTN group and by 23% in the SoSu group. Moreover, the prevalence of frailty decreased by 17% in the PTN group and by 16% in the SoSu group. The presence of impaired nutritional status at baseline was independently associated with greater changes in the nutritional (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.18, 95% CI 1.26-7.98; P = .014) and frailty status (adjusted OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.01-9.93; P = .049) after 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that a home-based physical training, nutritional, and social support intervention conducted by nonprofessionals is feasible and can help to tackle malnutrition and frailty in older persons living at home. Furthermore, social support alone also can result in improvement. In particular, older adults with impaired nutritional status at baseline can benefit more from the intervention. Such a home visit program might also have the potential to prevent future health risks and could allay isolation and loneliness.",0
1068,"BACKGROUND: Social wellbeing factors such as loneliness and social support have a major impact on the health of older adults and can contribute to physical and mental wellbeing. However, with increasing age, social contacts and social support typically decrease and levels of loneliness increase. Group social engagement appears to have additional benefits for the health of older adults compared to socialising individually with friends and family, but further research is required to confirm whether group activities can be beneficial for the social wellbeing of older adults. METHODS: This one-year longitudinal mixed methods study investigated the effect of joining a community group, offering a range of social and physical activities, on social wellbeing of adults with a mean age of 70. The study combined a quantitative survey assessing loneliness and social support (n = 28; three time-points, analysed using linear mixed models) and a qualitative focus group study (n = 11, analysed using thematic analysis) of members from Life Activities Clubs Victoria, Australia. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in loneliness (p = 0.023) and a trend toward an increase in social support (p = 0.056) in the first year after joining. The focus group confirmed these observations and suggested that social support may take longer than 1 year to develop. Focus groups also identified that group membership provided important opportunities for developing new and diverse social connections through shared interest and experience. These connections were key in improving the social wellbeing of members, especially in their sense of feeling supported or connected and less lonely. Participants agreed that increasing connections was especially beneficial following significant life events such as retirement, moving to a new house or partners becoming unwell. CONCLUSIONS: Becoming a member of a community group offering social and physical activities may improve social wellbeing in older adults, especially following significant life events such as retirement or moving-house, where social network changes. These results indicate that ageing policy and strategies would benefit from encouraging long-term participation in social groups to assist in adapting to changes that occur in later life and optimise healthy ageing.",0
1069,"Objectives: To assess the preliminary effectiveness of Meaning-Centered Men's Groups (MCMG), a 12-session existentially-oriented, community-based, psychological group intervention designed to enhance psychological resiliency and prevent the onset or exacerbation of suicide ideation among men who are concerned about or struggling with the transition to retirement.Methods: We recruited 30 men (n= 10 per group), 55 years and older (M= 63.7, SD= 4.1) from community settings to participate in a course of MCMG to be delivered in a community center. Participants completed eligibility, pre-, mid-, and post-group assessments of suicide ideation and psychological risk and resiliency factors.Results: Participants experienced significant increases in attitudinal sources of meaning in life, psychological well-being, life satisfaction, retirement satisfaction, and general health, and decreases in depression, hopelessness, loneliness, and suicide ideation.Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that MCMG is a novel men's mental health intervention that may help to enhance psychological well-being and potentially reduce the severity or prevent the onset of symptoms of depression, hopelessness, and suicide ideation.Clinical Implications: Upstream psychological interventions may serve an important role in mental health promotion and suicide prevention with potentially vulnerable individuals facing challenging life transitions.",0
1070,"AIM: To explore perceptions of a self-help print-delivered intervention aimed at encouraging social well-being and addressing loneliness in a retirement village community. METHOD: A total of 58 residents of an Australian retirement village received a series of five factsheets addressing various dimensions of loneliness. RESULTS: The factsheets raised awareness of the importance of social well-being and loneliness. However, the approach was considered difficult to update and was not appropriate for those from a non-English speaking background or with vision impairments. The non-face-to-face approach also was unable to address issues of loneliness associated with bereavement. CONCLUSION: This form of intervention offers a cost-effective way to raise awareness of loneliness and social well-being in a retirement village community when issues of updating and presentation of information are taken into consideration.",0
1071,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether loneliness is associated with higher health care utilization among older adults in the United States. METHODS: We used panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (2008 and 2012) to examine the long-term impact of loneliness on health care use. The sample was limited to community-dwelling persons in the United States aged 60 years and older. We used negative binomial regression models to determine the impact of loneliness on physician visits and hospitalizations. RESULTS: Under 2 definitions of loneliness, we found that a sizable proportion of those aged 60 years and older in the United States reported loneliness. Regression results showed that chronic loneliness (those lonely both in 2008 and 4 years later) was significantly and positively associated with physician visits (β = 0.075, SE = 0.034). Loneliness was not significantly associated with hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness is a significant public health concern among elders. In addition to easing a potential source of suffering, the identification and targeting of interventions for lonely elders may significantly decrease physician visits and health care costs.",0
1072,"BACKGROUND: according to the World Health Organisation, the role of the environment for older adults is to maintain and facilitate independence and promote quality of life. However, measures that examine the environment in terms of its potential impact on older people are either oriented towards specific aspects of the environment, specifically designed for community-level assessment rather than individually oriented, or are unwieldy for everyday use. OBJECTIVES: this article describes the development and validation of the Age-Friendly Environment Assessment Tool (AFEAT), assessing whether individual function and frailty impact on perceptions of environmental age-friendliness. The extent to which such perceptions may have moderate impacts of frailty on outcomes such as need for care support, quality of life and loneliness is examined. METHODS: a total of 132 participants aged 58-96 were recruited from retirement villages and local communities in the Midlands of the UK. Participants completed the AFEAT, and a series of measures designed to assess frailty and assessments of quality of life, loneliness and perceptions of functional limitations. RESULTS: internal reliability assessment indicated that the AFEAT possesses a Cronbach's Alpha score of 0.745. The AFEAT significantly predicted quality of life and loneliness, accounting for 17.1% and 5.8% of variance respectively, indicating high concurrent and predictive validity. Furthermore, the AFEAT moderated the predictive strength of frailty in predicting the amount of formal care an individual receives, but not quality of life or loneliness. DISCUSSION: the AFEAT is a valid and reliable tool, and analyses highlight the need for an individual-oriented Age-Friendly environment tool.",0
1073,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to highlight the actions needed and organisations to make a difference to the problem of loneliness in old age. Design/methodology/approach - Draws on the work of the Campaign to End Loneliness in collaboration with hundreds of organisations worldwide to document what has been done so far and to provide exemplars and imagined case studies based on collected experience to identify potential relevant actions. Findings - Many hundreds of organisations worldwide are recognising the need to support older peoples' connections and abilities to engage with their communities. However, these need to be better mapped and coordinated. Practical implications - Innovative work is already being done to tackle loneliness needs to be more systematically supported and promoted. Originality/value - Identifies how much has already changed in terms of recognising and addressing loneliness but that a more comprehensive approach to support is needed.",0
1074,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this is to examine whether pain is associated with the onset of loneliness in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: We used data from the 2008 and 2012 Health and Retirement Study. We limited the sample to community-dwelling persons aged 60 years and over who were not lonely in 2008 in order to predict the risk of onset of loneliness (incidence) in 2012. Our analytic sample included 1,563 observations. RESULTS: Approximately 31.7% of participants reported loneliness at follow-up (2012). Logistic regression models showed that the odds of loneliness onset was 1.58 higher for those with pain at both time points, compared with those who had pain at neither time point, even after controlling for other covariates. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that pain may increase the risk of loneliness in older adults. This suggests that appropriate pain interventions could prevent future loneliness, which in turn could prevent functional decline, disability, and premature mortality.",0
1075,"OBJECTIVE: To provide empirical evidence on the effects of home and community-based services (HCBS) (vs nursing home) use on spousal health. DATA SOURCES: Merged data from the 1996 to 2012 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Area Health Resource File (AHRF). STUDY DESIGN: We assess the impact of HCBS use on spousal health. We use an instrumental variable (IV) approach to account for the potential endogeneity of the choice of care setting and reverse causality. Our instrument is the supply of skilled nursing home beds per 1000 people older than 65 years. DATA EXTRACTION METHODS: Our sample includes spouses of HCBS or nursing home users, resulting in 8608 observations. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We find that HCBS use leads to harmful effects on spousal physical health, which may be caused by increased informal care responsibilities. We also find improved spousal mental health, especially in depression symptoms, which may be caused by increased satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: We find evidence of both beneficial (mental health) and harmful (physical health) consequences for spouses of individuals receiving LTC at home relative to in an institution. Our results are important in estimating the potential cost and effectiveness of HCBS expansion.",0
1076,"BACKGROUND: Trials aimed at preventing cognitive decline through cognitive stimulation among those with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment are of significant importance in delaying the onset of dementia and reducing dementia prevalence. One challenge in these prevention trials is sample recruitment bias. Those willing to volunteer for these trials could be socially active, in relatively good health, and have high educational levels and cognitive function. These participants' characteristics could reduce the generalizability of study results and, more importantly, mask trial effects. We developed a randomized controlled trial to examine whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation delivered through personal computers, a webcam and the internet would have a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. To examine the selectivity of samples, we conducted a mass mail-in survey distribution among community-dwelling older adults, assessing factors associated with a willingness to participate in the trial. METHODS: Two thousand mail-in surveys were distributed to retirement communities in order to collect data on demographics, the nature and frequency of social activities, personal computer use and additional health-related variables, and interest in the prevention study. We also asked for their contact information if they were interested in being contacted as potential participants in the trial. RESULTS: Of 1,102 surveys returned (55.1% response rate), 983 surveys had complete data for all the variables of interest. Among them, 309 showed interest in the study and provided their contact information (operationally defined as the committed with interest group), 74 provided contact information without interest in the study (committed without interest group), 66 showed interest, but provided no contact information (interest only group), and 534 showed no interest and provided no contact information (no interest group). Compared with the no interest group, the committed with interest group were more likely to be personal computer users (odds ratio (OR) = 2.78), physically active (OR = 1.03) and had higher levels of loneliness (OR = 1.16). CONCLUSION: Increasing potential participants' familiarity with a personal computer and the internet before trial recruitment could increase participation rates and improve the generalizability of future studies of this type. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on 29 March 2012 at ClinicalTirals.gov (ID number NCT01571427).",0
1077,"The present study evaluated a social network typology of continuing care retirement community (CCRC) residents and examined it against their physical and emotional wellbeing. The social network typology was constructed, using a name-generator, followed by detailed questions about the characteristics of the individuals who make up the network and the nature of the relationship with them. Latent profile analysis was used to develop a typology of the social network in the CCRC. A two-profile solution had the best fit to the data (Entorpy = .955, BIC = 3178.397). This solution consisted of a friends-based network (N = 97), and a child-based network (N = 108). The two networks differed on most constituent variables used for the creation of the two profiles (e.g., overall network size, proportion of friends, family members and spouse in the network). The two profiles did not differ in terms of the number of medical conditions, impairment in activities of daily living, wellbeing, and loneliness. Possibly, compared with the community, network type plays a lesser role in the CCRC because of its social characteristics and attempt to meet older adults' social needs.",0
1078,"OBJECTIVES: This study examines symptoms of subthreshold depression among older adults in congregate housing, compared with their nondepressed peers, and tests a conceptual model of subthreshold depression. Hypotheses included that subthreshold depression would be characterized and distinguished by low energy, social withdrawal, and depletion, rather than sadness, and that subthreshold depressed elders would be distinguished by poorer health and functioning, loneliness, and grieving a recent loss. METHOD: A self-administered survey was followed by a diagnostic interview by telephone to (N = 166) white and African-American residents of independent and assisted living apartments from six retirement communities, average age 82.9 years. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) determined depression status. The 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale was used to measure symptoms. RESULTS: Forty-six individuals (27.7%) were identified as subthreshold depressed, seven as suffering from major depression, and 113 as non-depressed. Subthreshold depression was characterized by low energy, difficulty with initiative, worries about the future, lack of positive affect, sadness and irritability. Negative affect symptoms such as sadness and irritability best discriminated the subthreshold group from the nondepressed. Risk factors for subthreshold depression in this sample included less education, lower socio-economic status, African-American race, grieving, and social loneliness. CONCLUSION: Subthreshold depression in this group of residents of congregate housing was similar to the depletion experienced by many nondepressed elders, but further characterized by negative affect and lack of hope for the future. Social factors, such as socioeconomic status and personal losses, constituted greater risks for subthreshold depression than did health and functioning.",0
1079,"OBJECTIVE: To determine mortality rates and to rank the causes and predictors of mortality using a wide range of sociodemographic and clinical variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is a prospective population-based cohort study of adults living in the community, 2013-15 N = 48,691, age ≥50; deceased = 1,944. Clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe SHARE: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Years of Schooling, Income, Loneliness, Cognition, Self-Rated Health, Diseases, Activities of daily living ADL, and Frailty. Mortality rates were calculated. A Cox proportional hazards model were used to determine risk-adjusted mortality ratios. RESULTS: The crude mortality rate was 18.39 (1000 person-years at risk), (99 % CI, 18.37-18.42). The factors most associated with an increased mortality risk were older age, lower self-rated health, lower cognition, male gender, ADL deficits, higher comorbidity, frailty and loneliness. The diseases with a higher mortality risk were: cancer (Hazard ratio, HR = 2.67), dementia (HR = 2.19), depressive symptoms (HR = 2.10), fractures (hip, femur) (HR = 1.57), stroke (HR = 1.55), chronic lung disease (HR = 1.52), diabetes (HR = 1.36) and heart attack (HR = 1.21). CONCLUSIONS: The main mortality risk factors, associated independently in the eight diseases were: older age, poor self-rated health, ADL deficits, male gender, lower cognition, comorbidity and the presence of depressive symptoms, with a different influence in the European regions. The need to evaluate and treat the depressive symptoms that accompanies diseases with higher risk of mortality is stressed.",0
1080,"AIMS: Prospective studies have shown that social isolation (i.e. lack of social contacts) predicts incident coronary heart disease (CHD), but it is unclear whether it predicts incident heart failure (HF) and what factors might mediate this association. HF patients may be more susceptible to social isolation as they tend to be older and may have disrupted social relationships due to life course factors (e.g. retirement or bereavement). We prospectively examined whether individuals with higher vs. low social isolation have a higher incidence of HF and determined whether this association is mediated by vital exhaustion. METHODS AND RESULTS: We estimated incident HF hospitalization or death among 14 348 participants from Visit 2 (1990-1992) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study using Cox proportional hazard models which were sequentially adjusted for age, race/study community, gender, current smoking, alcohol use, and co-morbidities. We conducted mediation analyses according to the Baron and Kenny method. After a median follow-up of 16.9 person-years, 1727 (13.0%) incident HF events occurred. The adjusted hazard of incident HF was greater for those in the higher vs. low social isolation risk group (hazard ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.35). Our data suggest that vital exhaustion strongly mediates the association between higher social isolation and incident HF (the percentage change in beta coefficient for higher vs. low social isolation groups after adjusting for vital exhaustion was 36%). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that greater social isolation is an independent risk factor for incident HF, and this association appears to be strongly mediated by vital exhaustion.",0
1081,"OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between alcohol use, at-risk drinking, and binge drinking, and loneliness in a sample of middle-aged and older adults. METHOD: We studied participants aged 50+ years from the 2008 wave of the Health and Retirement Study who reported alcohol use. We ran separate multinomial logistic regressions to assess the association of three alcohol use outcomes (i.e., weekly alcohol consumption, at-risk drinking, and binge drinking) and loneliness. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, being lonely was associated with reduced odds of weekly alcohol consumption 4 to 7 days per week, but not 1 to 3 days per week, compared with average alcohol consumption 0 days per week in the last 3 months. No association was found between at-risk drinking or binge drinking and loneliness. DISCUSSION: Results suggest that among a sample of community-based adults aged 50+, loneliness was associated with reduced alcohol use frequency, but not with at-risk or binge drinking.",0
1082,"OBJECTIVE: To explore influences on diet in a group of community-dwelling older adults in the UK. DESIGN: Data were collected through focus group discussions with older people; discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and transcripts analysed thematically. SETTING: Hertfordshire, UK. SUBJECTS: Participants were sampled purposively from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study, focusing on those whose diets had been assessed at two time points: 1998-2001 and 2011. RESULTS: Ninety-two adults participated (47 % women; 74-83 years) and eleven focus groups were held. A number of age-related factors were identified that were linked to food choices, including lifelong food experiences, retirement, bereavement and medical conditions, as well as environmental factors (such as transport). There appeared to be variability in how individuals responded to these influences, indicating that other underlying factors may mediate the effects of age-related factors on diet. Discussions about 'keeping going', being motivated to 'not give up', not wanting to be perceived as 'old', as well as examples of resilience and coping strategies, suggest the importance of mediating psychological factors. In addition, discussion about social activities and isolation, community spirit and loneliness, indicated the importance of social engagement as an influence on diet. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to promote healthier diets in older age should take account of underlying psychological and social factors that influence diet, which may mediate the effects of age-related factors.",0
1083,"The purpose of this qualitative study is to understand the reasons why elders move to retirement communities and what living in retirement communities is like from the perspective of relocated elders. Several themes emerged following qualitative analysis. The themes reflect three categories, labeled as ""pushing"" factors, ""pulling"" factors, and ""overlapping"" factors. Pushing factors included own or spouse's failing health, getting rid of responsibilities, not helped, facility closed out, and loneliness. Pulling factors were location, familiarity and reputation of the facility, security, and joining friends. The third category reflected both pushing and pulling factors, which overlapped and constituted their reason for moving. The findings help to inform the planning of tailored interventions to address elders' special needs or concerns associated with relocation.",0
1084,"In this article, we evaluate social ties in the context of the continuing care retirement community (CCRC). We interviewed 29 CCRC residents and 19 adult children about the transition to the CCRC. We analyzed the interviews thematically, while searching for consistencies and differences regarding social ties within and across interviews. Three major themes were identified: a time dimension, representing the perceived qualities of relationships based on the time during which the relationships were first formed; and two spatial dimensions, representing the CCRC vs. the community at large and private vs. public space and identity. The findings demonstrate that social ties can be classified according to dimensions of time, space, and quality--classifications that are not currently incorporated in the gerontological literature. Although CCRCs help to alleviate the social loneliness (i.e., lack of social ties) experienced by older adults, they are less successful in alleviating emotional loneliness (i.e., lack of intimate relations).",0
1085,"Loneliness is often manifested by intense feelings of emptiness and abandonment and can lead to depression and suicide. The prevalence of loneliness in older adults is estimated to be 40%. This secondary analysis examined differences between elders reporting and elders not reporting loneliness and the effect of gender on resourcefulness and measures of physical and mental health within the context of L. C. Hawkley and J. T. Cacioppo's (2010) theoretical model of loneliness. A descriptive, comparative design was used to examine gender differences and associations among loneliness and indicators of physical and mental health. Results indicated that for overall health, and indicators of physical health (functional status and number chronic conditions), no significant differences were found between those who reported loneliness and those who reported no loneliness. There were significant differences, however, between lonely elders and nonlonely elders on indicators of mental health, including both anxiety and depressive symptoms. Differences between lonely elders and nonlonely elders on measures of resourcefulness approached significance. The findings from this study suggest that intervention programs designed to prevent or reduce loneliness in older adults may be beneficial for preserving their mental health.",0
1086,"Much has been written about the important role that subjective social status plays in older adults' well-being and subjective health. Less is known, however, about the potential role played by subjective social status in people's sense of loneliness. In the present study, the author examined the role of subjective social status as a predictor of loneliness in adult day care centers (ADCCs) and continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) over a 1-year period. The main analyses consist of data from 245 respondents (141 ADCC participants and 104 CCRC residents) who completed the interviews in Waves 1 and 2. A significant interaction between subjective social status and type of long-term care setting was found. Higher levels of subjective social status were associated with lower levels of loneliness in CCRCs, but no such association was evident in ADCCs. These findings are interpreted in view of the characteristics of the CCRC as a total institution versus the ADCC as a setting that provides support for only several hours per day, several days per week.",0
1087,"Transitions into retirement can be difficult at the best of times. Many men find themselves having to reflect on who they are and what their lives are about. Their access to social supports and material resources are often disrupted. Men's Sheds offer a space where retired men can actively pursue wellbeing, and respond to disruption and loneliness through emplaced community practices. This paper draws on ethnographic research in a Men's Shed in Auckland, New Zealand in order to explore the social practices through which men create a shared space for themselves in which they can engage in meaningful relationships with each other. We document how participants work in concert to create a space in which they can be together through collective labour. Their emplacement in the shed affords opportunities for supported transitions into retirement and for engaging healthy lives beyond paid employment.",0
1088,"Socio-emotional selectivity theory posits that as individuals age, they desire less social stimulation and novelty, and tend to select close, reliable relationships to meet their emotional needs. Residence in congregate facilities affords social exposure, yet does not guarantee access to close relationships, so that loneliness may be a result. Further, the gerontology literature has suggested that loneliness in late life may be a risk factor for serious mental health concerns such as depression. This article examined data on loneliness and depressive symptoms from older adults aged 60-98, residing in two age-segregated independent living facilities. Overlap between those scoring in the depressed range on the Geriatric Depression Scale and those scoring more than one standard deviation above the mean on the UCLA Loneliness Scale was less than 50%, although zero-order correlation of the two continuous scores was moderately high. Potential risk and resilience factors were regressed on the continuous scores of the two scales in separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Depression was predicted by being older, number of chronic health conditions, grieving a recent loss, fewer neighbor visitors, less participation in organized social activities and less church attendance. Grieving a recent loss, receiving fewer visits from friends, and having a less extensive social network predicted loneliness. In addition, loneliness scores explained about 8% of the unique variance in depression scores, suggesting it is an independent risk factor for depressive symptoms. Loneliness scores were seen to be more widely dispersed in these respondents, with less variance explained by the available predictors. Suggestions are made for addressing loneliness in older adults as a means of preventing more serious mental health consequences.",0
1089,"The purpose of the study was to examine the impact of cancer caregiving on primary caregivers, exploring their personal narratives looking back on the entire experience from diagnosis, through treatment, and beyond. Caregiving is associated with exacerbation of stress-related disorders such as hypertension and heart disease and may also be associated with increased mortality rates. Transitions theory served as the conceptual framework for the study. Eleven adult caregivers, pre-retirement age, each participated in two semi-structured interviews. Caregivers were recruited from a community cancer resource center and were purposively selected to achieve maximum variation in terms of outcome of cancer treatment. The sample included 8 females and 3 males; there were 3 husbands, 6 wives, and 2 daughters. Caregivers provided care for patients with a variety of cancer types and a variety of treatment outcomes, from cancer free with sequelae to deceased. Each caregiver interview recording was transcribed, and preliminary examination of each transcript helped guide subsequent interviews. NVivo9 software was used to assist with data management. Data saturation was achieved. Narrative within-case analyses as well as thematic analysis were used to address research questions. Thematic analysis resulted in seven themes: Burden: The Load that Never Ends; Disconnectedness and Isolation: The Invisible Person; Helplessness and Loss of Control: Tied to This Ride; Dealing with the Healthcare System; Role Disruption: Spinning the Plates; Loss, Change, and Grief: Reaction to the Whole; and Carrying Forward with Scars: New Priorities and Permanent Change. All of the caregivers changed their employment or social responsibilities due to the demands of caregiving. Themes were present in different parts of the cancer trajectory and in differing intensities in all interviews. Findings included disconnectedness and isolation as a central feature of cancer caregiving, plus significant grief present through the cancer trajectory, especially in the post-treatment phase. Furthermore, the experience of cancer caregiving remained one of significant impact years after treatment had ended. Successful transitioning requires connectedness and mastery, but participants in this study identified that their caregiving trajectories were full of isolation, grief, burden, and helplessness. Many suggested the need for support, even though they tended to deny their own physical and emotional needs while caregiving. Healthcare professionals can help by providing information, support, listening, and grief counselling. Research is needed on interventions that may reduce isolation, helplessness, and burden for caregivers.",0
1090,"Accessible summary • Resilience is the ability of an individual or group to carry on and solve problems so that survival of hard times is more likely. Resilience protects individuals from depression and includes behaviours that can be taught to persons who are vulnerable to hardships including physical illness, psychosocial isolation and aloneness, and mental illness. • Older adults who rated their overall health as relatively good were also more willing to talk with health providers about depressive symptoms if it was affecting their social activities, making them feel useless to others, or affecting how well they could think or concentrate. • New research needs to occur to learn more about how to build resilience in older adults with symptoms of depression in hopes of encouraging them to talk about depressive symptoms with the health provider. The goal is to prevent symptoms from progressing to a diagnosable disorder. • The more resilience a person demonstrates, the more likely that person is to talk with health professionals about depressive symptoms and seek care to relieve those symptoms. New research is also needed to learn which factors other than resilience and depressive symptoms have an influence on how willing older African Americans are to seek mental health care for those symptoms. The purpose was to explore influence of resilience on the willingness of African Americans aged 65 and over to seek mental health care for depressive symptoms. Specifically, the study examined relationships between personal resilience and willingness of undiagnosed, community dwelling older adults to seek mental health care for depressive symptoms. A cross-sectional, correlational, causal modelling design was used to study older African Americans ( N= 158; 121 women and 37 men) recruited from churches, retirement organizations and senior nutrition centres. Participants completed study instruments to measure depressive symptoms, resilience, willingness to seek mental health care, and general demographics information. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analyses were preformed. Depressive symptoms and resilience accounted for 15.4% of the willingness to seek mental health care variance; extraction of resilience lowered variance to 0.9%. A direct, predictive relationship between resilience and willingness to seek mental health care was documented. Understanding resilience and willingness to seek mental health care supports future research for interventions that bolster resilience in older adults. Identifying the influence of resilience on such willingness may provide direction for developing interventions for older African Americans and may be applicable to vulnerable, marginalized and minority older adults worldwide.",0
1091,"Introduction of hemodialysis therapy has been associated with increased survival of chronic renal disease patients. However, retirement by disability and reduction of physical and occupational activities cause isolation, feelings of worthlessness, and Quality of Life (QoL) reduction. Evaluations and supplementary therapies susceptible of increasing QoL are gaining space in investigations. Occupational Therapy (OT) can improve functional capacity, promote social and occupational reinsertion and enhance QoL of chronic renal disease patients under hemodialysis therapy. Methods: Sixty patients with chronic renal disease under regular hemodialysis therapy were involved. The study group composed by twenty subjects in hemodialysis therapy was submitted to an OT programme and the control group with forty subjects followed the conventional treatment. The Occupational therapy programme consisted in individualized sessions as theoretical fundamental based on the Human Occupational Model. Questionnaire SF36 was initially applied and reapplied tree months later after intervention. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 12.0 for Windows using parametric and non parametric tests. Results: In female patients, score improvements were found (p<0.05) on Pain, Emotional Aspects and Mental Health domains among the study group, and no statistical significant change was found in the control group. Comparing both groups, there was a significant improvement in the pain domain for the study group (p<0.05). In male patients, no significant changes were observed in the study group whereas a significant deterioration occurred in the functional capacity domain (p<0.05) in the control group. Conclusions: Occupational therapy may be included in the therapeutic approach for patients under hemodialysis aiming to improve QoL.",0

Physicians should monitor social isolation, depression, and compliance with driving-related recommendations. Patient and family education materials including information on transportation resources in the community are important adjuncts to care.",0
1093,"The elderly population is increasing as baby boomers are beginning to approach retirement. People 65 years of age or older already constitute approximately one eighth of the U.S. population; this proportion is expected to double in the next 50 years. Older Americans have their own population-specific health challenges, such as Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, adult-onset diabetes, prostate cancer, menopause, and hypertension. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are seldom discussed within this community. Prevention, counseling, testing, and education efforts are not being directed their way. In addition, few practitioners are experts in both HIV and health problems associated with aging, resulting in misdiagnosis, especially in the early stages when AIDS symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and diminshed appetite are dismissed as part of the aging process. Very few HIV-related social support services have been aimed at the needs of the elderly, perhaps because older Americans are not suspected to be sexually active or are assumed to be in a monogamous, heterosexual relationship. Older Americans are not suspected of drug use. Yet many are sexually active, often demonstrating risky sexual behavior, such as dispensing with the use of condoms; and the isolation that frequently accompanies old age and lead to alcoholism and injectable drug use. This article examines methods suggested in the literature both in terms of primary and secondary prevention of HIV/AIDS in older Americans. The cost of these efforts is enumerated, and organizations who gear their efforts in reaching and educating older Americans regarding their risks are described.",0
1094,"Falls in older adults are common in the long-term care setting and are associated with functional decline, isolation, and depression. Increased attention is being given by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to have nursing homes implement quality assurance programs with the aim to reduce falls. Within the nursing home, pharmacists are expected to conduct at least monthly medication reviews and monitor for therapeutic effectiveness as well as adverse consequences of medications. This article discusses pharmacist-led team interventions to reduce fall risk in residents at a continuing care retirement community. One intervention is a fall risk evaluation form that notifies the assisted living care team of modifiable risk factors for residents who fall frequently. Examples include recommendations on discontinuing psychotropic medications that affect gait or alter mental status. In conjunction with the nursing home care team, the pharmacist also created two other programs that aim to (a) improve bone health by identifying residents who have low vitamin D levels and evaluating their need for calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and (b) educate the nursing staff of specific medication side effects that increase fall risk.

1095,"Background. Falls are among the most common and serious health problems of older people. Also, falls can have a significant physical and psychosocial impact on the individual, resulting in physical inactivity and subsequent functional decline and social isolation. However, the psychological symptoms of falling have received relatively little attention compared to physical problems.Purpose. The purpose of this study is to test a model to explain the factors that influence FOF among older adults living in a continuing care retirement community (CCRC).Methods. A secondary analysis was conducted using data obtained from a Health Promotion Survey done on 149 older adults living in a CCRC. Data was originally obtained during face to face interviews with each participant. Eligibility for participation included residents living in independent or assisted living apartments with at least 65 years of age. Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations were used to describe the sample and evaluate simple correlations. A path analysis was done using the AMOS statistical program.Results. Of the 49 hypothesized paths, 13 were statistically significant, and the model accounted for 22% of the variance in fear of falling among the elderly. There was support for the fit of the model to the data with a nonsignificant chi square at 0.478 (df= 2, p=0.79), and the ratio of chi-square to degrees of freedom was 0.24, a CFI of 0.99 and RMSEA of 0.00. In particular, gender, a history of falling, and exercise were significant predictors of fear of falling; Age and mental health influenced fall incidents; and Self-efficacy and outcome expectation played an important role in maintaining exercise behavior in older adults.Conclusions/Implications. This study develops the comprehensive model to explain the predictors of fear of falling. As anticipated, exercise is an important factor to prevent fear of falling. As a modifiable variable, self-efficacy and outcome expectation indirectly influence fear of falling through exercise. This study clearly indicates the need to motivate older adults to engage in exercise. Further research should examine other factors that influence fear of falling with a larger sample size in a heterogeneous setting.",0

Grandchildren raised by grandparents often suffer from emotional and behavioral problems due to prior abuse, neglect, and abandonment. Grandparent caregivers experience increased health problems, psychological distress, and social isolation related to their roles as primary caregivers of children. Grandparents who become caregivers of grandchildren face increased financial responsibilities at a time in their lives, close to or at retirement, when income is dramatically decreased.",0

1098,"A common perception is that only old people have strokes. However this condition also occurs in adults under retirement age. Few studies have been conducted relating to this age group post stroke and there is a paucity of services available for them once they are discharged from traditional rehabilitation services. In July 1995 a Day Service Pilot Project was launched in Cardiff for people who were aged between 18 and 55 years and who had a stroke. This unique service aimed to provide them with the opportunity to identify and pursue meaningful and realistic opportunities within the community. It was established in the belief that these adults were not fully participating in society. This study is an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of those who attend this service and an evaluation of the service using quantitative and qualitative method s. Twenty-six participants were recruited to the study between June 1998 and January 2000. The findings suggest that attendance at the service increased participation in leisure activities, perceptions of increased occupational performance and feelings of independence. The environment was considered a 'safe' one which prevented isolation, promoted social interaction and aided general recovery. The findings also indicated that post-stroke these individuals were not fully independent in activities of daily living, over 50% were depressed and anxious, they had a poor quality of life, they did not retain the range of roles they had prior to the stroke and although they had a range of self-care, productivity and leisure occupations which were important to them, they had difficulty in performing them. Although there were some gains from attending the service there were also many unmet needs. The service providers need to reconsider the aims and structure of such services to target these needs. Further research is required to continue to identify how best to meet the needs of individuals post stroke under retirement age.",0
1099,"Institutionalization of senior citizens is foreign to Arab Moslem mores. However, the rapid modernization process witnessed among the Arab population in Israel is also leaving its mark on the social values of this community: the once axiomatic rule that offspring or close family act as sole caregivers of the elderly person is losing its strength. Thus, the Arab community is slowly viewing the idea of external caregiving in a more positive light. The object of the present descriptive account is to compose a primary profile of the elderly Arab citizen who enters, or already occupies, one of the two old age homes for Arabs in Israel. The salient features that will make an elderly person a candidate for placement include lack of family, sick and/or invalid partner, childlessness, loneliness, and diminished ADL (activities of daily living). To make retirement homes a meaningful part of the rapidly westernizing Arab society in Israel, the contents of the formal services aimed at these citizens is open to reevaluation.",0
1100,"To assess the internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity, and concurrent validity of the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) within community-dwelling older people in Spain, Greece, Croatia, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Cross-sectional study. Primary care and community settings. In total, 2250 community-dwelling older people (60.3% women; mean age = 79.7 years; standard deviation = 5.7). We assessed the reliability and validity of the full TFI as well as its physical, psychological, and social domains. Baseline data of the Urban Health Centers Europe project were used. The internal consistency was assessed with the Cronbach alpha. The convergent and divergent validity were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients between the domains and alternative measures: the 12-item short-form, Groningen activity restriction scale, 5-item mental well-being scale of the 36-Item Short Form Survey, and the De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale. The concurrent validity was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with physically frail (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe-Frailty Instrument), loss of independence (Groningen activity restriction scale), limited function (Global Activity Limitation Index), poor mental health (5-item mental well-being scale of the 36-Item Short Form Survey), and feeling lonely (De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale) as criteria. The internal consistency of the full TFI was satisfactory with the Cronbach alpha ≥0.70 in the total population and in each country. The internal consistency of the psychological and social domains was not satisfactory. The convergent and divergent validity of the physical, psychological, and social domains was supported by all the alternative measures in the total population and in each country. The concurrent validity of the full TFI and the physical, psychological, and social domains was supported with most area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ≥0.70 in the total population and in each country. The TFI is a reliable and valid instrument to assess frailty in community-dwelling older people in Spain, Greece, Croatia, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.",0

Retirement is one such change.,0
1102,"This paper provides an introduction to a special issue focusing on diverse examples of policy practice in social inclusion and ageing across different regions of the world. These examples illustrate the multifaceted nature of the concept of social inclusion, and how it is applied in the context of global demographic ageing. The paper begins with an exploration of the history and development of the concept of social inclusion, as applied to ageing policy, and how the concept has emerged following its initial association with economic disadvantage. Now commonly defined as relating to social participation in key activities of the society in which people live, a social inclusionary approach highlights the risks of social exclusion and isolation faced by older people. Social inclusion thus incorporates core issues in ageing such as civil engagement, an ageing workforce, age-friendly communities, and civic involvement. There are some particular challenges to implementing social inclusion policies within the current environment, which are addressed within this special issue, and these include the impact of social and cultural change, particularly across some of the East Asian countries, and the impact of global financial crises on work and retirement.",0
1103,"Background. Loneliness is a prevalent problem for older adults and has been shown to be associated with negative physical, psychological, and social variables. There has been limited research focusing on the relationship of loneliness to health. There is a gap in the literature when it comes to understanding how the problem of loneliness relates to the health of older adults in the United States.Purpose. The purpose of this study was to address this gap in the literature through the testing of two models, the first model represented the postulated risks for loneliness and the second model represented the postulated outcomes for those who experience loneliness. Variables were chosen for inclusion in the models based on a review of pertinent quantitative and qualitative literature.Methods. The models were tested using a representative sample of U.S. older adults. Data analysis was performed using data from the 2002 and 2004 waves of the Health and Retirement Study. The sample was limited to respondents aged 50 and older who participated in wave 6 (2002) and wave 7 (2004) without proxy, answered the lonely question at both waves, were community-dwelling in 2002 and who had complete data on selected variables in the model. Univariate and bivariate analyses were followed by logistic regression analysis to identify risks. One-way ANOVAs, comparative means testing and independent analysis of covariance tests were used to evaluate the difference in outcomes for those who were never lonely, briefly lonely, or chronically lonely.Results. Non-married status was consistently the primary predictor of self-report of loneliness, followed by poorer self-report of health status, lower educational level, functional impairment, increasing number of chronic illnesses, younger age, lower income, and less people living in the household. Gender and use of home care were not significant predictors of loneliness. Those who were chronically lonely reported less exercise, more tobacco use, less alcohol use, a greater increase in number of chronic illnesses, higher depression scores, more physician contacts and greater average number of nights in a nursing home than those who were never lonely or briefly lonely. After controlling for significant covariates of loneliness, those who were chronically lonely did not have significantly more physician contacts.Discussion. Loneliness is a prevalent problem for older adults in the United States with its own unique health-related risks and outcomes. Given the prevalence, it should be considered a healthcare priority in the United States. Based on the results of this study, inclusion of loneliness and loneliness risk screening as part of routine health histories for those aged 50 and over should be considered. Future research needs to focus on evaluating the effectiveness of both prevention and treatment interventions for loneliness to provide empirical data to guide evidenced based practice.",0
1104,"Objectives: Passive suicide ideation (PSI) is common among older adults, but prevalences have been reported to vary considerably across European countries. The goal of this study was to assess the role of individual-level risk factors and societal contextual factors associated with PSI in old age. Method: We analyzed longitudinal data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) on 6,791 community-dwelling respondents (75+) from 12 countries. Bayesian logistic multilevel regression models were used to assess variance components, individual-level and country-level risk factors. Results: About 4% of the total variance of PSI was located at the country level, a third of which was attributable to compositional effects of individual-level predictors. Predictors for the development of PSI at the individual level were female gender, depression, older age, poor health, smaller social network size, loneliness, nonreligiosity, and low perceived control (R² = 25.8%). At the country level, cultural acceptance of suicide, religiosity, and intergenerational cohabitation were associated with the rates of PSI. Discussion: Cross-national variation in old-age PSI is mostly attributable to individual-level determinants and compositional differences, but there is also evidence for contextual effects of country-level characteristics. Suicide prevention programs should be intensified in high-risk countries and attitudes toward suicide should be addressed in information campaigns.",0
1105,"The aging of society is an inescapable trend that some neighborhoods, municipalities, and counties are admitting needs their attention. As the extent of the changes required to become senior friendly, let alone sustainable, are being realized, many communities are experiencing pushback from voters, old-guard city and county staff, and even elected officials. While initially appearing counter-intuitive, if we plan for the aging of society along with four other first-time-ever, equally inescapable trends-peak oil, water scarcity, obesity, and climate change-we come to realize the critical role of the built environment as a common denominator in preparing for a future very different than most of us have anticipated. As such, changes to the built environment that move a community closer to realizing sustainable senior living also contribute to lower energy needs and costs, a smaller carbon footprint, water savings, and an overall healthier population. By focusing on the built environment as the key to sustainable senior living communities, we are able to build more inclusive collaborative work teams, reach out to two underutilized resources in retirees and college and university students, and leverage the planned-for changes in ways that help finance future modifications. Clarified below, these ideas, strategies, and actions are, in the end, described as part of a five-year, ongoing, service learning partnership.",0

1108,"Introduction: Mental health challenges are increasing for older adults. Over 20% of seniors in Canada report having a mental illness; while many individuals have higher rates of chronic disease, which include mental health challenges as presenting primary conditions and comorbidities (e.g. depression). Seniors and individuals with chronic physical disease are identified as being vulnerable for mental health issues. Unfortunately mental health in this age group is often not addressed and can significantly impact the costs for individuals, caregivers and the health system. A focus on early detection, prevention, and the promotion of mental well-being is essential. Promoting mental health and well-being can increase protective factors, decrease risk factors, and address social determinants of health. Addressing health concerns, including mental health in rural communities is significantly more challenging. Rural communities face challenges shaped by unique social and environmental factors. These include an aging population, lower socio-economic status, lower education levels, decreased access to health care services and geographic isolation, especially in the winter months. A research study was conducted in three rural/semi-rural communities in southern British Columbia, Canada focusing on mental health in older adults. The aims of this project were three-fold: 1) to identify the needs of adults 50 and over experiencing a mental health concern; 2) to identify current services and supports available and gaps in services and supports; and 3) to identify opportunities for integrated services and supports for these individuals, their caregivers and community-based organizations. Methods: Six consultation sessions were conducted across the three communities. In each community, one session was completed with community members with a mental health concern and another with community organization representatives. Informed consent was received from all participants. Sessions were audio-recorded and field notes were taken. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Results: Six interrelated themes were identified: lack of resources; access issues; poverty; stigma; purpose and meaning in life; and factors influencing mental health. Lack of resources included funding, human resources, and services and supports. Specifically identified was the lack of collaboration and communication between health care professionals, paraprofessionals, and community supports. Access issues commonly acknowledged by participants were long wait lists, availability of services and supports, cost of private services, transportation, difficulties in completing paperwork for services, and eligibility criteria for services (e.g., needing to have a diagnosis to obtain a service). Poverty was identified as a major factor for adults 50 and over with a mental health concern. Housing, income, and balancing needs and finances (e.g., medications or food) were commonly cited by participants. Stigma was also identified as a common concern among participants. Stigma was seen to be higher in rural communities, in this age group and among men. Participants also discussed the contribution of lack of purpose and meaning in life, which was particularly evident in this age group. Retirement, children moving away from home, and lack of cognitive challenge all contributed to the feeling of not being valued. Finally, participants discussed factors that influenced mental health in their communities. These included trauma, isolation, stress, and self - medication or substance use due to the lack of available services and supports. Discussion: The needs for adults with mental health concerns in this age group were well articulated by participants. Many gaps in services and supports were identified. The most common concern voiced by all participants was the lack of community-based services and supports. Furthermore, providers were not well integrated and lacked connection to each other. Community-based integrated services and supports were desired and recommended by participants. Conclusion: This study identifies the importance of community-based integrated services and supports for adults 50 and over with a mental health concern in rural communities. This information will be beneficial to decision-makers and policy-makers in the development and delivery of new services and supports for this population.",0
1109,"Objective. The study aimed to assess the impact of HPV immunization campaigns organizational aspects, the characteristics of immunization program (vaccination targets and type of offer), and communicative strategies adopted by four Italian administrative regions on vaccination coverage observed. Methods. From November 2017 to March 2018, regional and Local Health Units (LHUs) representatives were invited to complete an online survey including 54 questions evaluating vaccination invite systems, access systems to vaccination centres, reminder and recall systems, and adverse events surveillance. An overall descriptive analysis was conducted. Since observed vaccine coverage (VC) obtained in females (2002-2004 birth cohorts) was lower than objectives fixed by the Italian Ministry of Health, variables were assessed using the national VC mean obtained in the 2003 girls birth cohort as outcome. Results. Twenty-six LHUs belonging to 4 Northern and Southern Italian regions participated in the study. Organizational aspects significantly related to VC lower than the national mean were access to vaccine centres without appointment and parents' reservation as appointment planning system. Recall systems for both the first and the second dose, including the appointment in the invitation letter, the availability of regional immunization registry, and education of healthcare workers on universal HPV immunization strategies, instead, were related to higher VC. As regards preadolescent immunization strategies, both VC obtained in girls and boys were far from the Ministerial goals. Only 20% of LHUs introduced multicohort female strategies while all LHUs adopted copayment targeting both men and women. Immunizations strategies targeting subjects at risk were implemented only in half of participating LHUs. Conclusions. VC observed in participating LHUs are largely lower than the national objectives in all anti-HPV vaccine targets. Both organizational and educational strategies have to be implemented to improve the VC goals.",0
1110,"The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to and facilitators of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in children aged 9-17 years across Texas. A literature review informed the development of a web-based survey designed for people whose work involves HPV vaccination in settings serving pediatric patients. The survey was used to examine current HPV vaccine recommendation practices among healthcare providers, barriers to HPV vaccination, reasons for parent/caregiver vaccine refusal, staff and family education practices, utilization of reminder and recall systems and status of vaccine administration (payment, ordering and stocking). 1132 responses were received representing healthcare providers, administrative and managerial staff. Respondents identified perceived barriers to HPV vaccination as parental beliefs about lack of necessity of vaccination prior to sexual debut, parental concerns regarding safety and/or side effects, parental perceptions that their child is at low risk for HPV-related disease, and parental lack of knowledge that the vaccine is a series of three shots. Of responding healthcare providers, 94 % (n = 582) reported they recommend the vaccine for 9-12 year olds; however, same-day acceptance of the vaccine is low with only 5 % (n = 31) of providers reporting the HPV vaccine is ""always"" accepted the same day the recommendation is made. Healthcare providers and multidisciplinary care teams in pediatric care settings must work to identify gaps between recommendation and uptake to maximize clinical opportunities. Training in methods to communicate an effective HPV recommendation and patient education tailored to address identified barriers may be helpful to reduce missed opportunities and increase on-time HPV vaccinations.",0
1111,"In organized cervical screening programs, typically 25% of the invited women do not attend. The Copenhagen Self-sampling Initiative (CSi) aimed to gain experiences on participation among screening nonattenders in the Capital Region of Denmark. Here, we report on the effectiveness of different communication platforms used in the pilot with suggestions for strategies prior to a full-implementation. Moreover, an innovative approach using self-sampling brushes with unique radio frequency identification chips allowed for unprecedented levels patient identification safety. Nonattenders from the capital region of Denmark were identified via the organized national invitation module. Screening history was obtained via the nationwide pathology registry. Twenty-four thousand women were invited, and as an alternative to the regular communication platforms (letter and phone), women could request a home test via a mobile-friendly webpage. Instruction material and video-animation in several languages were made available online. Chi-square test was used to test differences. Out of all invited, 31.7% requested a home test, and 20% returned it to the laboratory. In addition, 10% were screened at the physician after receiving the invitation. Stratified by screening history, long-term unscreened women were less likely to participate than intermittently screened women (28% vs. 16%, p < 0.001). Of all contacts received, 64% (63-65) came via letter, and 31% (95CI: 30-32%) via webpage/mobile-app. Self-sampling was well-accepted among nonattenders. Adopting modern technology-based platforms into the current organized screening program would serve as a convenient communication method between health authority and citizens, allowing easy access for the citizen and reducing the work load in administrating self-sampling approaches.",0
1112,"Background: Participation in cervical cancer screening varies by socioeconomic status. The aims were to assess if offering human papilloma virus (HPV) self-sampling kits has an effect on screening participation among various socioeconomic groups and to determine if two invitation strategies for offering self-sampling influence the participation rate equally. Methods: The study was based on registry data that were applied to data from a randomized controlled trial (n=9,791) measuring how offering HPV self-sampling affected screening participation. The women received either 1) a self-sampling kit mailed directly to their homes (directly mailed group); 2) an invitation to order the kit (opt-in group); or 3) a standard second reminder to attend regular cytology screening (control group). The participation data were linked to registries containing socioeconomic information. Results: Women in the directly mailed group participated significantly more than women in the control group, regardless of their socioeconomic status, but the largest effects were observed in Western immigrants (participation difference [PD]=18.1%, 95% CI=10.2%-26.0%) and social welfare recipients (PD=15.2%, 95% CI=9.7%-20.6%). Compared with the control group, opt-in self-sampling only had an insignificant effect on participation among women who were immigrants, retired, or less educated. Western immigrants had a significantly higher increase in participation than native Danish women when kits were mailed directly compared with the opt-in strategy (PD=18.1%, 95% CI=10.2%-26.2% and PD=5.5%, 95% CI=2.9%-8.1%, respectively, P=0.01). Conclusion: All socioeconomic groups benefited from the directly mailed strategy in terms of higher screening participation, but Western immigrants and lower socioeconomic groups seemed to benefit the most. Immigrants and some lower socioeconomic groups only had insignificant benefits of opt-in self-sampling. The directly mailed strategy might be preferable to opt-in self-sampling because it ensures that ethnic minority groups obtain benefits of introducing HPV self-sampling in an organized cervical cancer screening program.

1113,"In Denmark, 45% of all incident cervical cancers are detected in underscreened women. High-level evidence supports, that non-participants in cervical cancer screening are better reached by HPV self-sampling than by regular physician-based screening, including increased uptake among un- or underscreened women. A high compliance to follow-up among HPV-positive self-samplers has been reported. In the new Danish cervical cancer screening guidelines, the regions are endorsed to offer HPV self-sampling to women, who are due to receive the second screening reminder, and in this manner potentially improve cervical cancer prevention.",0
1114,"We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether HPV self-sampling increases participation in cervical screening by never- and under-screened (not screened in past 5 years) women when compared with a reminder letter for a Pap test. Never- or under-screened Victorian women aged 30-69 years, not pregnant and with no prior hysterectomy were eligible. Within each stratum (never-screened and under-screened), we randomly allocated 7,140 women to self-sampling and 1,020 to Pap test reminders. The self-sampling kit comprised a nylon tipped flocked swab enclosed in a dry plastic tube. The primary outcome was participation, as indicated by returning a swab or undergoing a Pap test; the secondary outcome, for women in the self-sampling arm with a positive HPV test, was undergoing appropriate clinical investigation. The Roche Cobas® 4800 test was used to measure presence of HPV DNA. Participation was higher for the self-sampling arm: 20.3 versus 6.0% for never-screened women (absolute difference 14.4%, 95% CI: 12.6-16.1%, p < 0.001) and 11.5 versus 6.4% for under-screened women (difference 5.1%, 95% CI: 3.4-6.8%, p < 0.001). Of the 1,649 women who returned a swab, 45 (2.7%) were positive for HPV16/18 and 95 (5.8%) were positive for other high-risk HPV types. Within 6 months, 28 (62.2%) women positive for HPV16/18 had colposcopy as recommended and nine (20%) had cytology only. Of women positive for other high-risk HPV types, 78 (82.1%) had a Pap test as recommended. HPV self-sampling improves participation in cervical screening for never- and under-screened women and most women with HPV detected have appropriate clinical investigation.",0
1116,"HPV vaccination rates in Florida are low. To increase rates, the CDC recommends clinics adhere to components of their evidence-based quality improvement program, AFIX (Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange of information). We explored factors associated with engaging in HPV-specific AFIX-related activities. In 2016, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of 770 pediatric and family medicine physicians in Florida and assessed vaccination practices, clinic characteristics, and HPV-related knowledge. Data were analyzed in 2017. The primary outcome was whether physicians' clinics engaged in ≥1 AFIX activity. We stratified by physician specialty and developed multivariable models using a backward selection approach. Of the participants in the analytic sample (n = 340), 52% were male, 60% were White of any ethnicity, and 55% were non-Hispanic. Pediatricians and family medicine physicians differed on: years practicing medicine (p < 0.001), HPV-related knowledge (p < 0.001), and VFC provider status (p < 0.001), among others. Only 39% of physicians reported engaging in ≥1 AFIX activity. In the stratified multivariable model for pediatricians, AFIX activity was significantly associated with HPV-related knowledge (aOR = 1.33;95%CI = 1.08-1.63) and provider use of vaccine reminder prompts (aOR = 3.61;95%CI = 1.02-12.77). For family medicine physicians, HPV-related knowledge was significant (aOR = 1.57;95%CI = 1.20-2.05) as was majority race of patient population (non-Hispanic White vs. Other: aOR = 3.02;95%CI = 1.08-8.43), daily patient load (<20 vs. 20-24: aOR = 9.05;95%CI = 2.72-30.10), and vaccine administration to male patients (aOR = 2.98;95%CI = 1.11-8.02). Fewer than half of Florida pediatric and family medicine physicians engaged in any AFIX activities.

Purpose: To examine the relationship between knowledge about HPV and adherence to scheduled colposcopic evaluation and variables related to lack of knowledge among women with abnormal Pap tests. Methods: Telephone surveys were conducted with women who attended their scheduled appointments (adherers) and women who did not attend their appointments (nonadherers). Results: The multivariable analyses indicate that lower HPV knowledge was independently associated with nonadherence to follow-up, controlling for race and education level. Factors related to lower knowledge scores included non-white race, lower education, and lack of health insurance at the time of the scheduled appointment. Conclusion: Lack of knowledge of HPV was related to nonadherence among women scheduled for colposcopic evaluation. Translation to Health Education Practice: Health education interventions that deliver complex information about HPV and cervical cancer should be in a format that is accessible and understandable to the women who are most at risk of being nonadherent.",0
1118,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of cervical cancer in Kenya is among the highest in the world. Few Kenyan women are able to access screening, thus fueling the high cervical cancer burden. Self-collected human papilloma Virus (HPV) tests, administered during community-health campaigns in rural areas may be a way to expand access to screening. METHODS: In December 2015, we carried out a four-day community health campaign (CHC) to educate participants about cervical cancer prevention and offer self-administered HPV screening. Community enumeration, outreach and mobilization preceded the CHC. Samples were sent to Migori County Hospital for HPV DNA testing using careHPV Test Kits. Women were notified of results through their choice of short message service (SMS), phone call, home visit or clinic visit. HPV positive women were referred for cryotherapy following a screen-and-treat strategy. RESULTS: Door-to-door enumeration identified approximately 870 eligible women in Ngodhe Community in Migori County. Among the 267 women attending the campaign, 255 women enrolled and collected samples: 243 tests were successfully resulted and 12 were indeterminate. Of the 243 resulted tests, 47 (19%) were positive for HPV, with young age being the only significant predictor of positivity. In multivariate analysis, each additional year of age conferred about a 4% decrease in the odds of testing positive (95% CI 0.1 to 7%, p = 0.046). Just over three-quarters of all women (195/255), were notified of their results. Those who were unable to be reached were more likely to prefer receiving results from clinic (54/60, 90%) and were less likely to have mobile phones (24/60, 73%). Although 76% of HPV positive women were notified of their results, just half (51%) of those testing positive presented for treatment. HPV positive women who successfully accessed the treatment facility did not differ from their non-presenting counterparts by demographics, health history, desired route of notification or access to a mobile phone. CONCLUSION: Nearly a third of eligible women in Ngodhe Community attended the CHC and were screened for cervical cancer. Nearly all women who attended the CHC underwent cervical cancer screening by self-collected HPV tests. Three-quarters of all participants received results, but just half of HPV positive participants presented for treatment in a timely fashion, suggesting that linkage to treatment remains a major challenge.

1119,"BACKGROUND: Nova Scotia has the highest rate of cervical cancer in Canada, and most of these cases are attributed to the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). In 2007, Gardasil(®) was approved and implemented in a successful school-based HPV immunization program. Little is known, however, which strategies (if any) used within a school-based program help to improve vaccine uptake. METHODS: A retrospective, exploratory correlation study was conducted to examine the relationship between school-based strategies and uptake of HPV vaccine. Data was analyzed through Logistic regression, using PASW Statistics 17 (formerly SPSS 17). RESULTS: HPV vaccine initiation was significantly associated with Public Health Nurses providing reminder calls for: consent return (p=0.017) and missed school clinic (p=0.004); HPV education to teachers (p<0.001), and a thank-you note to teachers (p<0.001). Completion of the HPV series was associated with vaccine consents being returned to the students' teacher (p=0.003), and a Public Health Nurse being assigned to a school (p=0.025). CONCLUSIONS: These findings can be used to help guide school-based immunization programs for optimal uptake of the HPV vaccine among the student population.",0
1120,"BACKGROUND: Although cervical cancer is largely preventable through screening, detection and treatment of precancerous abnormalities, it remains one of the top causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality globally. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review is to understand the evidence of the effect of cervical cancer education compared to control conditions on cervical cancer screening rates in eligible women population at risk of cervical cancer. We also sought to understand the effect of provider recommendations for screening to eligible women on cervical cancer screening (CCS) rates compared to control conditions in eligible women population at risk of cervical cancer. METHODS: We used the PICO (Problem or Population, Interventions, Comparison and Outcome) framework as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook to develop our search strategy. The details of our search strategy has been described in our systematic review protocol published in the International Prospective Register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO). The protocol registration number is CRD42016045605 available at: http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.asp?src=trip&ID=CRD42016045605. The search string was used in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Systematic Reviews and Cochrane CENTRAL register of controlled trials to retrieve study reports that were screened for inclusion in this review. Our data synthesis and reporting was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). We did a qualitative synthesis of evidence and, where appropriate, individual study effects were pooled in meta-analyses using RevMan 5.3 Review Manager. The Higgins I2 was used to assess for heterogeneity in studies pooled together for overall summary effects. We did assessment of risk of bias of individual studies included and assessed risk of publication bias across studies pooled together in meta-analysis by Funnel plot. RESULTS: Out of 3072 study reports screened, 28 articles were found to be eligible for inclusion in qualitative synthesis (5 of which were included in meta-analysis of educational interventions and 8 combined in meta-analysis of HPV self-sampling interventions), while 45 were excluded for various reasons. The use of theory-based educational interventions significantly increased CCS rates by more than double (OR, 2.46, 95% CI: 1.88, 3.21). Additionally, offering women the option of self-sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing increased CCS rates by nearly 2-fold (OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.22). We also found that invitation letters alone (or with a follow up phone contact), making an appointment, and sending reminders to patients who are due or overdue for screening had a significant effect on improving participation and CCS rates in populations at risk. CONCLUSION: Our findings supports the implementation of theory-based cervical cancer educational interventions to increase women's participation in cervical cancer screening programs, particularly when targeting communities with low literacy levels. Additionally, cervical cancer screening programs should consider the option of offering women the opportunity for self-sample collection particularly when such women have not responded to previous screening invitation or reminder letters for Pap smear collection as a method of screening.",0
1121,"BACKGROUND: A high percentage of cervical cancer cases have not undergone cytological tests within 10 years prior to diagnosis. Different population interventions could improve coverage in the public system, although costs will also increase. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and the costs of three types of population interventions to increase the number of female participants in the screening programmes for cancer of the cervix carried out by Primary Care in four basic health care areas. METHODS/DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from the perspective of public health system including women from 30 to 70 years of age (n = 20,994) with incorrect screening criteria from four basic health care areas in the Valles Occidental, Barcelona, Spain. The patients will be randomly distributed into the control group and the three intervention groups (IG1: invitation letter to participate in the screening; IG2: invitation letter and informative leaflet; IG3: invitation letter, informative leaflet and a phone call reminder) and followed for three years. Clinical effectiveness will be measured by the number of HPV, epithelial lesions and cancer of cervix cases detected. The number of deaths avoided will be secondary measures of effectiveness. The temporal horizon of the analysis will be the life expectancy of the female population in the study. Costs and effectiveness will be discounted at 3%. In addition, univariate and multivariate sensitivity analysis will be carried out. DISCUSSION: IG3 is expected to be more cost-effective intervention than IG1 and IG2, with greater detection of HPV infections, epithelial lesions and cancer than other strategies, albeit at a greater cost.

1124,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) assays on self samples and the efficacy of self sampling strategies to reach underscreened women. DESIGN: Updated meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Medline (PubMed), Embase, and CENTRAL from 1 January 2013 to 15 April 2018 (accuracy review), and 1 January 2014 to 15 April 2018 (participation review). REVIEW METHODS: Accuracy review: hrHPV assay on a vaginal self sample and a clinician sample; and verification of the presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) by colposcopy and biopsy in all enrolled women or in women with positive tests. Participation review: study population included women who were irregularly or never screened; women in the self sampling arm (intervention arm) were invited to collect a self sample for hrHPV testing; women in the control arm were invited or reminded to undergo a screening test on a clinician sample; participation in both arms was documented; and a population minimum of 400 women. RESULTS: 56 accuracy studies and 25 participation trials were included. hrHPV assays based on polymerase chain reaction were as sensitive on self samples as on clinician samples to detect CIN2+ or CIN3+ (pooled ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.02). However, hrHPV assays based on signal amplification were less sensitive on self samples (pooled ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.89). The specificity to exclude CIN2+ was 2% or 4% lower on self samples than on clinician samples, for hrHPV assays based on polymerase chain reaction or signal amplification, respectively. Mailing self sample kits to the woman's home address generated higher response rates to have a sample taken by a clinician than invitation or reminder letters (pooled relative participation in intention-to-treat-analysis of 2.33, 95% confidence interval 1.86 to 2.91). Opt-in strategies where women had to request a self sampling kit were generally not more effective than invitation letters (relative participation of 1.22, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.61). Direct offer of self sampling devices to women in communities that were underscreened generated high participation rates (>75%). Substantial interstudy heterogeneity was noted (I2>95%). CONCLUSIONS: When used with hrHPV assays based on polymerase chain reaction, testing on self samples was similarly accurate as on clinician samples. Offering self sampling kits generally is more effective in reaching underscreened women than sending invitations. However, since response rates are highly variable among settings, pilots should be set up before regional or national roll out of self sampling strategies.",0
1125,"BACKGROUND: It has been claimed that publicity surrounding popular celebrity Jade Goody's experience of cervical cancer will raise awareness about the disease. This study examines the content of newspaper articles covering her illness to consider whether 'mobilising information' which could encourage women to adopt risk-reducing and health promoting behaviours has been included. METHODS: Content analysis of 15 national newspapers published between August 2008 and April 2009 FINDINGS: In the extensive coverage of Goody's illness (527 articles in the 7 months of study) few newspaper articles included information that might make women more aware of the signs and symptoms or risk factors for the disease, or discussed the role of the human papilloma virus (HPV) and the recently introduced HPV vaccination programme to reduce the future incidence of cervical cancer. For example, less than 5% of articles mentioned well-known risk-factors for cervical cancer and less than 8% gave any information about HPV. The 'human interest' aspects of Goody's illness (her treatment, the spread of her disease in later months, her wedding, and her preparations for her children's future) were more extensively covered. CONCLUSIONS: Newspaper coverage of Goody's illness has tended not to include factual or educational information that could mobilise or inform women, or help them to recognise early symptoms. However, the focus on personal tragedy may encourage women to be receptive to HPV vaccination or screening if her story acts as a reminder that cervical cancer can be a devastating and fatal disease in the longer term.",0
1126,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of general practitioners (GPs) follow-up of unvaccinated girls in the Danish Human Papillomavirus catch-up vaccination programme. Telephone interviews were conducted with the GPs to explore their follow-up procedure. The girls were divided into two groups: 1) girls contacted by their GP and 2) girls not contacted by their GP. Ten months later 61% of the girls, who had been contacted, had started vaccination in the follow-up group compared to 53% of girls, who had not been contacted (p < 0.02). Follow-up by GPs increased the likelihood of subsequent vaccination in a group of unvaccinated girls.",0
1127,"Data from the 2008 and 2009 National Immunization Survey-Teen were analyzed to determine age at initiation of the human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) series among females 13-17 years (n=7594) and assess compliance with the recommended HPV dosing intervals. Among females who initiated the HPV series, 56.7% of females<13 years at the time of the HPV vaccine recommendation publication did so by age 13; while the majority of females 13-14 and 15-17 years at the time of the recommendation publication did so at ages 14 (44.4%) and 16 (46.7%), respectively. Forty-six percent of females who received three doses completed the vaccination series in a period longer than the recommended time interval. Series completion at an earlier age to ensure protection before sexual debut is optimal. Improved provider communication of the need for three doses for long-term protection and implementing clinical practice guidelines to use reminder-recall systems may increase HPV completion.",0

1129,"Cervical cancer caused by oncogenic types of the human papillomavirus (HPV) is of concern among HIV-positive women due to impairment of immune responses required to control HPV infection. Our objectives were to describe patterns of cervical cancer screening using Pap cytology testing among HIV-positive women in Ontario, Canada from 2008 to 2013 and to identify factors associated with adequate screening. We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study among screen-eligible HIV-positive women using provincial administrative health data. We estimated annual proportions tested and reported these with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Next, using person-years as the unit of analysis, we identified factors associated with annual Pap testing using log-binomial regression. A total of 2271 women were followed over 10,697 person-years. In 2008, 34.0% (95%CI 31.1-37.0%) had a Pap test. By 2013, the proportion of HIV-positive women tested was 25.9% (95%CI 23.6-28.2%). Women who were most likely to undergo testing were younger, were immigrants from countries with generalized HIV epidemics, lived in the highest income neighbourhoods, had a female primary care physician, had two or more encounters per year with an infectious disease or internal medicine specialist, and had greater comorbidity. Nearly three in four HIV-positive women were under-screened despite all having universal insurance for medically-necessary services. Annual Pap testing decreased following the 2011-2013 release of new guidelines for a lengthened screen interval for average risk women and a billing disincentive. Clinic-based intervention such as physician alerts or reminders may be needed to improve screening coverage among HIV-positive women.",0
1130,"Background. The Faroe Islands have had nationally organised cervical cancer screening since 1995. Women aged 25-60 years are invited every third year. Participation is free of charge. Although several European overviews on cervical screening are available, none have included the Faroe Islands. Our aim was to provide the first description of cervical cancer screening, and to determine the screening history of women diagnosed with cervical cancer in the Faroe Islands. Material and methods. Screening data from 1996 to 2012 were obtained from the Diagnostic Centre at the National Hospital of the Faroe Islands. They included information on cytology and HPV testing whereas information on histology was not registered consistently. Process indicators were calculated, including coverage rate, excess smears, proportion of abnormal cytological samples, and frequency of HPV testing. Data on cervical cancer cases were obtained from the Faroese Ministry of Health Affairs. The analysis of the screening history was undertaken for cases diagnosed in 2000-2010. Results. A total of 52 457 samples were taken in 1996-2012. Coverage varied between 67% and 81% and was 71% in 2012. Excess smears decreased after 1999. At present, 7.0% of samples have abnormal cytology. Of all ASCUS samples, 76-95% were tested for HPV. A total of 58% of women diagnosed with cervical cancer did not participate in screening prior to their diagnosis, and 32% had normal cytology in the previous four years. Conclusion. Despite the difficult geographical setting, the organised cervical cancer screening programme in the Faroe Islands has achieved a relatively high coverage rate. Nevertheless, challenges, e.g. consistent histology registration and sending reminders, still exist.",0
1131,"BACKGROUND: Visual inspection after application of acetic acid (VIA) and Lugol's iodine (VILI) is a cervical cancer (CC) screening approach that has recently been adopted in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Innovative technologies allow the acquisition of consecutive cervical images of VIA and VILI using a smartphone application. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of smartphone images in order to assess the feasibility and usability of a mobile application for CC screening in LMIC. METHODS: Between May and November 2015, women aged 30-65 years were recruited in a CC screening campaign in Madagascar. Human papillomavirus-positive women were invited to undergo VIA/VILI assessment. Pictures of their cervix were taken using a Samsung Galaxy S5 with an application called ""Exam"", which was designed to obtain high-quality images and to classify them in the following sequence: native, VIA, VILI and posttreatment. Experts in colposcopy were asked to evaluate if the quality of the pictures was sufficient to establish the diagnosis and to assess sharpness, focus and zoom. RESULTS: The application use was simple and intuitive, and 208 pictures were automatically classified and recorded in the patient's file. The quality was judged as adequate for diagnosis in 93.3% of cases. The interobserver agreement was κ =0.45 (0.23-0.58), corresponding to a moderate agreement on the common scale of kappa values. CONCLUSION: This smartphone application allows the acquisition of good quality images for VIA/VILI diagnosis. The classification of images in a patient database makes them accessible to on- and off-site experts, and allows continuous clinical education. Smartphone applications may offer an alternative to colposcopy for CC screening in LMIC.",0
1132,"BACKGROUND: The National Cervical Screening Program in Australia currently recommends that sexually active women between the ages of 18-70 years attend routine screening every 2 years. The publically funded National HPV Vaccination Program commenced in 2007, with catch-up in females aged 12-26 years conducted until 2009; and this may prompt consideration of whether the screening interval and other aspects of the organized screening program could be reviewed. The aim of the current evaluation was to assess the epidemiologic outcomes and cost implications of changing the recommended screening interval in Australia to 3 years. METHODS: We used a modelling approach to evaluate the effects of moving to a 3-yearly recommended screening interval. We used data from the Victorian Cervical Cytology Registry over the period 1997-2007 to model compliance with routine screening under current practice, and registry data from other countries with 3-yearly recommendations to inform assumptions about future screening behaviour under two alternative systems for screening organisation--retention of a reminder-based system (as in New Zealand), or a move to a call-and-recall system (as in England). RESULTS: A 3-yearly recommendation is predicted to be of similar effectiveness to the current 2-yearly recommendation, resulting in no substantial change to the total number of incident cervical cancer cases or cancer deaths, or to the estimated 0.68% average cumulative lifetime risk of cervical cancer in unvaccinated Australian women. However, a 3-yearly screening policy would be associated with decreases in the annual number of colposcopy and biopsy procedures performed (by 4-10%) and decreases in the number of treatments for pre-invasive lesions (by 2-4%). The magnitude of the decrease in the number of diagnostic procedures and treatments would depend on the method of screening organization, with call-and-recall screening associated with the highest reductions. The cost savings are predicted to be of the order of A$10-18 M annually, equivalent to 6-11% of the total cost of the current program (excluding overheads), with call-and-recall being associated with the greatest savings. CONCLUSIONS: Lengthening the recommended screening interval to 3 years in Australia is not predicted to result in increases in rates of cervical cancer and is predicted to decrease the number of women undergoing diagnostic and treatment procedures. These findings are consistent with a large body of international evidence showing that screening more frequently than every three years with cervical cytology does not result in substantial gains in screening effectiveness.",0
1133,"Purpose: Data confirm that high rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination have not been achieved despite strong clinician endorsement of the vaccine. We conducted a study of primary care clinicians to assess the broad range of health care delivery, health policy, and attitudinal factors influencing vaccination uptake and opportunities for informed decision making.Methods: We implemented a mixed methods study in RIOS Net, a primary care practice-based research network in New Mexico. We first conducted qualitative, in-depth interviews with primary care clinicians, health policy makers, and immunization experts, and followed up with a confirmatory survey distributed to RIOS Net clinician members.Results: Health service delivery challenges emerged as the greatest barrier to HPV vaccination, specifically the lack of capacity to track and distribute reminders to eligible patients. Clinicians also reported variations in counseling approaches attributable to both age and emphasis on the cancer prevention benefits of the vaccine. There was no evidence of sociocultural influences on vaccine decision making, nor did concerns about perceived overprotection emerge.Conclusions: Our findings, based on a long-term program of research, suggest that both patients' attributes and health system delivery are most influential in HPV vaccination coverage challenges. Interventions targeting innovative communication techniques, as well as health system changes that build on efforts toward coordinated care and utilization of other venues to promote vaccination, will be necessary to address these challenges.",0
1134,"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are associated with a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly HPV16. This study analyzed the presence and genotype of high risk HPVs, viral DNA load and transcription of the E6/E7 mRNAs, in 231 consecutive HNSCC. Twelve out of 30 HPV16 DNA-positive tumors displayed high E6/E7 mRNAs levels and were localized in the oropharyngeal region. While HPV-free and non-transcriptionally active HPV-related patients showed similar 5-years survival rates, E6/E7 expression was associated with a better prognosis. This emphasizes the importance of considering the transcriptional status of HPV-positive tumors for patient stratification. A gene expression profiling analysis of these different types of tumors was carried out. The most significant differentially expressed gene was CDKN2A, a known biomarker for HPV-related cancer. Assessing both the expression level of the E6/E7 mRNAs and of CDKN2A in HNSCC is required to detect active HPV infection. Chromosomic alterations were investigated by Comparative Genomic Hybridation (CGH) analysis of tumors with transcriptionally active HPV and HPV-negative tumors. The loss of the chromosomal region 16q was found to be a major genetic event in HPV-positive lesions. A cluster of genes located in 16q21-24 displayed decreased expression levels, notably APP-BP1 that is involved in the modulation of the transcriptional activity of p53. In conclusion, this study highlights important criteria required to predict clinically active HPV infection, identifies new biological pathways implicated in HPV tumorigenesis and increases the understanding of HPV-HNSCC physiopathology that is required to develop new targets for therapy.",0
1136,"BACKGROUND: Adults are recommended to receive select vaccinations based on their age, underlying medical conditions, lifestyle, and other considerations. Factors associated with awareness of vaccine-preventable diseases and recommended vaccines among adults in the United States have not been explored. METHODS: Data from a 2015 internet panel survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults aged ≥19years were analyzed to assess awareness of selected vaccine-preventable diseases and recommended vaccines for adults. A multivariable logistic regression model with a predictive marginal approach was used to identify factors independently associated with awareness of selected vaccine-preventable infections/diseases and corresponding vaccines. RESULTS: Among the surveyed population, from 24.6 to 72.1% reported vaccination for recommended vaccines. Awareness of vaccine-preventable diseases among adults aged ≥19years ranged from 63.4% to 94.0% (63.4% reported awareness of HPV, 71.5% reported awareness of tetanus, 72.0% reported awareness of pertussis, 75.4% reported awareness of HZ, 75.8% reported awareness of hepatitis B, 83.1% reported awareness of pneumonia, and 94.0% reported awareness of influenza). Awareness of the corresponding vaccines among adults aged ≥19years ranged from 59.3% to 94.1% (59.3% HZ vaccine, 59.6% HPV vaccine, 64.3% hepatitis B vaccine, 66.2% pneumococcal vaccine, 86.3% tetanus vaccines, and 94.1% influenza vaccine). In multivariable analysis, being female and being a college graduate were significantly associated with a higher level of awareness for majority of vaccine-preventable diseases, and being female, being a college graduate, and working as a health care provider were significantly associated with a higher level of awareness for majority of corresponding vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: Although adults in this survey reported high levels of awareness for most vaccines recommended for adults, self-reported vaccination coverage was not optimal. Combining interventions known to increase uptake of recommended vaccines, such as patient reminder/recall systems and other healthcare system-based interventions, and ensuring patients' vaccination needs are assessed, are needed to improve vaccination of adults.",0
1137,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. Despite having easy preventive and therapeutic approaches, it is an important cause of mortality among women. METHODS: The CRICERVA study is a cluster clinical trial which assigned one of three interventions to the target population registered in Cerdanyola, Barcelona. Among the 5,707 resident women aged 60 to 70 years in the study area, women with no record of cervical cytology over the last three years were selected. The study included four arms: three interventions all including a pre-assigned date for screening visit and i) personalized invitation letter; ii) adding to i) an informative leaflet; and, iii) in addition to ii) a personalized appointment reminder phone call, and iv) no specific action taken (control group). Participants were offered a personal interview about social-demographic characteristics and about screening attitudes. Cervical cytology and HPV DNA test (HC2) were offered as screening tests. In the case of screening positive in any of these tests, the women were followed up until a full diagnosis could be obtained. The effect size of each study arm was estimated as the absolute gain in coverage between the original coverage and the final coverage. RESULTS: From the intervention groups (4,775 women), we identified 3,616 who were not appropriately screened, of which 2,560 women answered the trial call and 1,376 were amenable to screening. HPV was tested in 920 women and cervical cytology in all 1,376. Overall, there was an absolute gain in coverage of 28.8% in the intervention groups compared to 6% in the control group. Coverage increased from 51.2% to 76.0% in strategy i); from 47.4% to 79.0% in strategy ii) and from 44.5% to 74.6% in strategy iii). Lack of information about the relevance of screening was the most important factor for not attending the screening program. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that actively contacting women and including a date for a screening visit, notably increased participation in the screening program. Efforts to improve health education in preventative activities are warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov Identifier NCT01373723. Registered 14 June 2011.",0
1138,"While vaccines have decreased the burden of disease, many adolescents still remain under-immunized, particularly for human papillomavirus (HPV) and influenza. We review the most current data regarding adolescent immunizations in the United States and discuss proven strategies that work for increasing vaccination rates. Strategies that have been shown to improve rates include provider feedback, immunization information systems (or registries), and enhanced access outside of provider offices, such as school-based immunization programs. Overall, practices may want to consider multimodal quality improvement approaches to enhance practice vaccination rates. The public health and cost benefits of immunizing adolescents are well known, yet recent measles outbreaks in the United States have highlighted issues with state immunization laws and vaccine refusals. Providers should be clear in their advice regarding vaccines and use effective reminder strategies as parents commonly cite not having enough information or knowledge that a vaccine was needed for their adolescent. Additional research is needed regarding adolescent consent for vaccines, as well as adolescent and parental refusal, in order to design systems that will help inform families and allow for widespread vaccine availability.",0
1139,"PURPOSE: Vaccinating adolescents in a variety of settings may be needed to achieve high vaccination coverage. School-based health centers (SBHCs) provide a wide range of health services, but little is known about immunization delivery in SBHCs. The objective of this investigation was to assess, in a national random sample of SBHCs, adolescent immunization practices and perceived barriers to vaccination. METHODS: One thousand SBHCs were randomly selected from a national database. Surveys were conducted between November 2007 and March 2008 by Internet and standard mail. RESULTS: Of 815 survey-eligible SBHCs, 521 (64%) responded. Of the SBHCs, 84% reported vaccinating adolescents, with most offering tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis, meningococcal conjugate, and human papillomavirus vaccines. Among SBHCs that vaccinated adolescents, 96% vaccinated Medicaid-insured and 98% vaccinated uninsured students. Although 93% of vaccinating SBHCs participated in the Vaccines for Children program, only 39% billed private insurance for vaccines given. A total of 69% used an electronic database or registry to track vaccines given, and 83% sent reminders to adolescents and/or their parents if immunizations were needed. For SBHCs that did not offer vaccines, difficulty billing private insurance was the most frequently cited barrier to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Most SBHCs appear to be fully involved in immunization delivery to adolescents, offering newly recommended vaccines and performing interventions such as reminder/recall to improve immunization rates. Although the number of SBHCs is relatively small, with roughly 2000 nationally, SBHCs appear to be an important vaccination resource, particularly for low income and uninsured adolescents who may have more limited access to vaccination elsewhere.",0
1140,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and acceptance of a postal survey to measure human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and monitor vaccine impact, using self-taken specimens from young women who do not attend their first cervical screening appointment. METHODS: Focus groups informed the survey design identifying factors that would influence acceptability. Postal testing kits were sent to a nationally representative sample of unscreened women. Overall response rate, the influence of different specimen types (urine or vaginal swab) and the receipt of a reminder letter on participation were calculated. Specimens were tested anonymously for HPV. Individual test results were not provided. RESULTS: Of 5500 kits sent, 725 were returned (13.2%). Fifty-two women actively opted out. There was a higher return rate for urine kits (13.7% vs 12%) and from those who received a reminder letter (15.5% vs 12.2%). Response was influenced by deprivation (10.3% in the most deprived quintile vs 16.2% in the least). Overall weighted HPV prevalence was 35.9% (40.0% from swab specimens and 31.9% from urine). CONCLUSIONS: Some women were willing to participate in anonymised postal testing. However, the low uptake means that HPV prevalence results are difficult to interpret for ongoing surveillance. Monitoring HPV vaccine impact outwith the cervical screening programme remains challenging.",0
1141,"BACKGROUND: Historically, recruitment and retention of young women in intervention-based clinical trials have been challenging. In August 2012, enrollment for a clinical trial testing of an investigational human papillomavirus therapeutic vaccine called PepCan was opened at our institution. This study was an open-label, single-arm, single-institution, dose-escalation Phase I clinical trial. Women with recent Papanicolaou smear results showing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or results that could not rule out high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion were eligible to enroll. Patients with biopsy-confirmed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion were also eligible. Colposcopy was performed at the screening visit, and participants became eligible for vaccination when the diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion was confirmed with biopsy and other inclusion criteria were met. The aim of this study was to identify strategies and factors effective in recruitment and retention of study participants. METHODS: Potential vaccine candidates were recruited through direct advertisement as well as referrals, including referrals through the Arkansas telecolposcopy network. The network is a federally funded program, administered by physicians and advanced practice nurses. The network telemedically links rural health sites and allows physician-guided colposcopy and biopsies to be conducted by advanced practice nurses. A variety of strategies were employed to assure good retention, including face-to-face contact with the study coordinator at the time of consent and most of study visits; frequent contact using text messaging, phone calls, and e-mails; and creation of a private Facebook page to improve communication among research staff and study participants. A questionnaire, inquiring about motivation for joining the study, occupation, education, household income, number of children, and number of sexual partners, was administered at the screening visit with the intent of identifying factor(s) associated with recruitment and retention. RESULTS: A total of 37 participants were enrolled between September 2012 and March 2014. The largest proportion of participants (46%) was enrolled from the telecolposcopy network. Others were enrolled through outside institutions (43%), in-house referrals (8%), or direct advertisement (3%). Most participants were motivated to join the study to take care of their health issues. Only two participants joined the Facebook private page. Of the 24 participants who qualified for vaccination, only 1 terminated early due to an unanticipated move. CONCLUSION: The availability of a large number of potential participants from the telecolposcopy network increased recruitment to this clinical trial by 85% over other traditional means of recruitment. The telecolposcopy network is not only a means of providing a gynecological service to women who otherwise would forego care but also a novel and valuable resource in recruiting participants for a clinical trial.",0
1143,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness and effect of educational seminars given at 2 sites in north central Florida on the knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV), perceived barriers to HPV vaccination, and willingness to vaccinate against HPV in eligible patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was performed in conjunction with the Committee for the Healthcare of Underserved Women, District XII, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. One hundred participants, ages 18-65 years, were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Community outreach educational seminars, approximately 30 minutes in length, were given at 2 sites in Gainesville, Florida. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Before and after seminar surveys were given to evaluate the effect of the seminars on knowledge of HPV, willingness to vaccinate against HPV, and barriers to vaccination. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant improvement in the willingness to accept the HPV vaccine and an improvement in knowledge of several HPV-related facts. There was a statistically significant decrease in several perceived barriers to HPV vaccination. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the utility of educational seminars in patients' acceptance of health care options. Improving the educational opportunities of patients and families in relation to the HPV vaccine has the opportunity to make a significant outcome on vaccination rates.",0
1144,"BACKGROUND: Previous interventions in colleges to improve human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination have not been highly successful. Although barriers have been assessed in traditional colleges, less is known about vaccination barriers in community colleges. METHODS: We approached students aged 18-26 years old enrolled at a community college for an in-person semi-structured qualitative interview on HPV vaccination and health, with questions guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior. Data collection took place between April 2015 and December 2015. Thematic analysis techniques were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: During interviews with 19 students, 4 themes emerged, including: general vaccine attitudes, barriers to HPV vaccination, motivators to HPV vaccination, and social influences. Participants felt that vaccines were beneficial, but were concerned about side effects. They felt that getting the HPV vaccine would be inconvenient, and they did not know enough about it to decide. Most would not trust their friends' opinions, but would want to know about side effects that their vaccinated friends experienced. CONCLUSIONS: Successful interventions at community colleges should include several components to increase convenience as well as utilize interactive methods to promote HPV vaccine awareness.",0
1145,"OBJECTIVES: Misinformation and lack of formal education about cervical cancer may contribute to disparities. The objective of this study was to assess the role of an educational intervention in improving knowledge about Human papilloma virus (HPV) and cervical cancer among African American female college students. METHODS: We completed a total of 5 lectures at 4 different historically Black Colleges in North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. Each 60min lecture reviewed basic female anatomy, HPV pathogenesis, cervical dysplasia, cervical cancer, HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening. Participants completed pre- and post-lecture surveys assessing knowledge, attitudes and beliefs related to cervical cancer screening, HPV, and the HPV vaccine. RESULTS: A total of 72 students attended the lectures and 57 students completed the surveys. 96% of students reported knowledge of the HPV vaccine, however only 52% reported receiving the vaccine, and 42% completed the 3-shot series. About 77% of students over 21years of age reported having a Pap smear. Of the 16 knowledge-based questions, correct response rates significantly increased (74% v. 91%, p=0.005) with the intervention. At the completion of the intervention, 94% affirmed plans to get regular Pap smears and 87% affirmed plans to get the HPV vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Primary prevention and early detection are key interventions for reducing disparities in cervical cancer incidence and treatment. Community outreach efforts play an important role in reducing inequities in cancer among high-risk groups. The educational intervention utilized in this study was successful in improving knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer.",0
1146,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States and is a well-known cause of oropharyngeal, cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and anal cancers. Despite the proven efficacy of the HPV vaccine, vaccination rates remain persistently low. Much literature has focused on attitudes toward the HPV vaccine; however, researchers have also investigated strategies clinicians can use to improve vaccination attitudes and acceptance. Such strategies include provider education, vaccine reminder/recall, and chart audit and feedback. The purpose of this integrative review is to uncover the best evidence-based practice interventions, with the aim of improving HPV knowledge, patient-provider conversations, and immunization uptake. This integrative review concludes that multicomponent interventions have a synergistic effect, resulting in increased provider vaccine support, improved patient/parental attitudes toward HPV vaccination, and increased immunization uptake. Such strategies hold much promise for today's pediatric providers as they work to combat current vaccination disparities.",0
1147,"IMPORTANCE: Vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) are recommended for routine use in adolescents aged 11 to 12 years in the United States, but uptake remains suboptimal. Educational interventions focused on parents and patients to increase coverage have not generally demonstrated effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature on effectiveness of interventions conducted at the practice or community level to increase uptake of HPV vaccines in the United States. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Keyword searches of the PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE databases identified studies of adolescents that included the outcome of HPV vaccination published through July 2014. References of identified articles were also reviewed. A total of 366 records were screened, 38 full-text articles were reviewed, and 14 published studies were included. Results were summarized by different intervention approaches. FINDINGS: Practice- and community-based intervention approaches included reminder and recall (n = 7), physician-focused interventions (eg, audit and feedback) (n = 6), school-based programs (n = 2), and social marketing (n = 2) (2 interventions tested multiple approaches). Seven studies used a randomized design, and 8 used quasiexperimental approaches (one used both). Thirteen studies included girls, and 2 studies included boys. Studies were conducted in a variety of populations and geographic locations. Twelve studies reported significant increases in at least one HPV vaccination outcome, one reported a nonsignificant increase, and one reported mixed effects. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most practice- and community-based interventions significantly increased HPV vaccination rates using varied approaches across diverse populations. This finding is in stark contrast to a recent review that did not find effects to warrant widespread implementation for any educational intervention. To address the current suboptimal rates of HPV vaccination in the United States, future efforts should focus on programs that can be implemented within health care settings, such as reminder and recall strategies and physician-focused efforts, as well as the use of alternative community-based locations, such as schools.",0
1148,"Since the development of the ""adolescent platform"" of vaccination in 1997, hundreds of studies have been conducted, identifying barriers to and facilitators of adolescent vaccination. More recent research has focused on developing and evaluating interventions to increase uptake of adolescent vaccines. This review describes a selection of recent intervention studies for increasing adolescent vaccination, divided into three categories: those with promising results that may warrant more widespread implementation, those with mixed results requiring more research, and those with proven effectiveness in other domains that have not yet been tested with regard to adolescent vaccination.",0
1149,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides a clinically relevant review and analysis of the latest research regarding barriers to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and strategic efforts to promote this vaccine. RECENT FINDINGS: HPV vaccines are safe, effective, and could prevent the majority of HPV-attributable cancers, if vaccination coverage is high. However, uptake of HPV vaccine lags behind other vaccines recommended for 11 to 12-year olds. A lack of provider recommendation has consistently been found to be a key barrier to increasing vaccination rates. Lack of knowledge about the vaccine among parents coupled with an overestimation of parental vaccine hesitancy among providers also hinder vaccine uptake. Strongly recommending the vaccine as a safe, routine immunization that prevents cancer, and coadministering it with tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine and quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine, enhance vaccine uptake. In some cases, reminder and recall systems result in additional increases in vaccination rates. SUMMARY: Recent publications reveal new information about the implementation of HPV vaccines. Provider recommendation is a key approach, as is offering it routinely at the same time as other universally recommended adolescent immunizations. With the integration of these concepts into the clinical setting, adolescents can be better protected against HPV and its associated diseases.",0
1150,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review examines the effectiveness of communication technology interventions on HPV vaccination initiation and completion. METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy was used to identify existing randomized controlled trials testing the impact of computer-, mobile- or internet-based interventions on receipt of any dose of the HPV vaccine. Twelve relevant studies were identified with a total of 38,945 participants. RESULTS: The interventions were delivered using several different methods, including electronic health record (i.e. recall/reminder) prompts, text messaging, automated phone calls, interactive computer videos, and email. Vaccine initiation and completion was greater for technology-based studies relative to their control conditions. CONCLUSION: There is evidence that interventions utilizing communication technologies as their sole or primary mode for HPV vaccination intervention delivery may increase vaccination coverage. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Communication technologies hold much promise for the future of HPV vaccination efforts, especially initiatives in practice-based settings.",0
1151,"PROBLEM: It has been reported that some adolescents and young women who started taking human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination are not completing all three doses. The aim of this study was to systematically review intervention studies on HPV vaccination completion. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Intervention studies with a comparison group that assessed HPV vaccination completion rate as the primary outcome variable in adolescents and adults younger than 26years of age, and published in English from 2006 to 2016, were eligible for review. SAMPLE: Five studies from a literature search of CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycARTICLES, PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases were included in this review. RESULTS: The overall quality of the reviewed studies was moderate, and the studies have mainly been conducted in a high-income country. Intervention strategies were DVD-based education on HPV and reminders that were delivered via either electronic or non-electronic methods. Some studies used fixed type of electronic reminders. Others chose preference-based electronic reminders, allowing participants to select one or two delivery options from e-mail, text message, automated telephone message, or Facebook message. Non-electronic reminders were letters sent by standard mail. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of HPV vaccination completeness increased with the interventions. However, the completeness rate of HPV vaccination remained unsatisfactory and lower than its initiation rate. IMPLICATIONS: Educational and reminder interventions for HPV vaccination could contribute to HPV vaccination completion. However, this review highlights the need for more high-quality studies to identify the best way to promote vaccination completion.",0
1152,"PROBLEM: The updated Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 2016 guidelines recommends vaccination for the human papillomavirus (HPV) for all adolescents starting at ages 11-12 years. The United States continues to fall short of the benchmarks set by Healthy People 2020. The national vaccination rates hover at 49.5%, creating much room for improvement in health care systems. The purpose of this literature review was to identify evidence-based interventions to implement for improved outcomes. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: An integrative literature review was conducted using the CINAHL, EBSCO, Academic Search Complete, ProQuest and Medline databases. The search was limited to studies published in peer reviewed journals in the last 10 years. SAMPLE: Of the available studies, 201 met inclusion criteria with 46 studies meriting further review. RESULTS: Barriers to vaccination included missed opportunities due to lack of provider recommendation and awareness of current guidelines, and parental vaccination hesitancy. Effective strategies included reminder systems and strong provider recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: No one method has been effective in maintaining increases in vaccination rates. Multi-method strategies demonstrate the highest rates of maintaining increases in HPV vaccination. Strong provider recommendations are a cornerstone to any multi-method intervention. IMPLICATIONS: Providers and nurses need to shift conversations to strong recommendations for the HPV vaccination and include additional reminder systems, including protocols to meet Healthy People 2020 goals for HPV vaccination.",0
1153,"BACKGROUND: In high-income countries, substantial differences exist in vaccine uptake relating to socioeconomic status, gender, ethnic group, geographic location and religious belief. This paper updates a 2009 systematic review on effective interventions to decrease vaccine uptake inequalities in light of new technologies applied to vaccination and new vaccine programmes (eg, human papillomavirus in adolescents). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, ASSIA, The Campbell Collaboration, CINAHL, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Eppi Centre, Eric and PsychINFO for intervention, cohort or ecological studies conducted at primary/community care level in children and young people from birth to 19 years in OECD countries, with vaccine uptake or coverage as outcomes, published between 2008 and 2015. RESULTS: The 41 included studies evaluated complex multicomponent interventions (n=16), reminder/recall systems (n=18), outreach programmes (n=3) or computer-based interventions (n=2). Complex, locally designed interventions demonstrated the best evidence for effectiveness in reducing inequalities in deprived, urban, ethnically diverse communities. There is some evidence that postal and telephone reminders are effective, however, evidence remains mixed for text-message reminders, although these may be more effective in adolescents. Interventions that escalated in intensity appeared particularly effective. Computer-based interventions were not effective. Few studies targeted an inequality specifically, although several reported differential effects by the ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: Locally designed, multicomponent interventions should be used in urban, ethnically diverse, deprived populations. Some evidence is emerging for text-message reminders, particularly in adolescents. Further research should be conducted in the UK and Europe with a focus on reducing specific inequalities.",0
1156,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of reminder/recall (R/R) for immunizing adolescents in private pediatric practices and to describe the associated costs and revenues. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 4 private pediatric practices in metropolitan Denver. In each practice, 400 adolescents aged 11 to 18 years who had not received 1 or more targeted vaccinations (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis, meningococcal conjugate, or first dose of human papillomavirus vaccine for female patients) were randomly selected and randomized to intervention (2 letters and 2 telephone calls) or control (usual care) groups. Primary outcomes were receipt of >1 targeted vaccines and receipt of all targeted vaccines 6 months postintervention. We calculated net additional revenue for each additional adolescent who received at least 1 targeted vaccine and for those who received all targeted vaccines. RESULTS: Eight hundred adolescents were randomized to the intervention and 800 to the control group. Baseline rates of having already received tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis, meningococcal conjugate, and first dose of human papillomavirus vaccine before R/R ranged from 33% to 54%. Postintervention, the intervention group had significantly higher proportions of receipt of at least 1 targeted vaccine (47.1% vs 34.6%, P < .0001) and receipt of all targeted vaccines (36.2% vs 25.2%, P < .0001) compared with the control group. Three practices had positive net revenues from R/R; 1 showed net losses. CONCLUSIONS: R/R was successful at increasing immunization rates in adolescents and effect sizes were comparable to those in younger children. Practices conducting R/R may benefit financially if they can generate additional well-child care visits and keep supply costs low.",0
1157,"PURPOSE: We evaluated a managed care organization (MCO)-generated text message reminder-recall system designed to improve human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of text reminder-recall for parents of 3,812 publicly insured adolescents aged 11-16 years with no prior HPV vaccinations who were enrolled in a single MCO and were patients at one of 39 primary care practices. We determined the rate of HPV receipt for intervention versus control with the Kaplan-Meier failure function and determined hazard ratios using a clustered stratified Cox model, clustering on primary care provider and stratified on practice. We examined results for all subjects, and for those with a valid phone number, stratified by age group (11-13 years and 14-16 years) and gender. A post hoc analysis included all subjects and controlled for age and gender. RESULTS: HPV dose 1 vaccination rates were not significantly different when all participants were included, but for the subset of parents (54%) able to receive messages, HPV dose 1 rates were 13% for the control group and 16% for the intervention group; hazard ratio, 1.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.6; p = .04), when controlling for age and gender. There were no significant findings in the analysis stratified by age and gender. CONCLUSIONS: MCO-based text reminders are feasible and have a modest effect on HPV dose 1 vaccination rates for those parents able to receive text messages with valid phone numbers in the MCO database. Future studies should examine a similar intervention for those parents who already accepted the first HPV vaccine dose.",0
1158,"INTRODUCTION: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated recommendations for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in 2016. National and statewide statistics indicate that HPV vaccination in the adolescent population is well below the administration rates for other vaccines. Because cancers associated with HPV infection are vaccine preventable, low administration rates are a cause for concern. METHODS: Through a two-year project funded by the South Dakota Department of Health, Sanford Health implemented a quality improvement project to address the low rate of HPV vaccine administration in their clinics in South Dakota. Evidence-based interventions included: implementation of a client reminder and recall system, vaccine education for providers and staff, a provider assessment and feedback system, and re-education on protocol (standing) orders. RESULTS: Implementation of this quality improvement project resulted in the following: 104,571 client reminders distributed, re-education on standing orders for vaccine administration, as well as feedback on missed opportunities for vaccination, and increased awareness for all providers and staff. In patients ages 11-26, HPV vaccine series completion rates increased by 13 percent in the two-year period. Zero-dose HPV vaccination dropped 22 percent in the seven pilot clinics over the two-year grant period, and by 10 percent overall when the additional clinics (n=32) were added in the second year. DISCUSSION: Implementation of the above practices provided a significant increase in awareness of the need to assess and administer HPV vaccine. The methods used are easily adaptable to any clinic system. These practices can increase HPV vaccination rates and ultimately decrease the number of HPV associated cancers.",0
1159,"PURPOSE: Acceptance and coverage of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in the United States has been suboptimal. We implemented a multifaceted provider and staff intervention over a 1-year period to promote HPV vaccination in a regional health care system. METHODS: The intervention was conducted in nine clinical departments from February 2015 to March 2016; 34 other departments served as controls. The intervention included in-person provider and staff education, quarterly feedback of vaccine coverage, and system-wide changes to patient reminder and recall notifications. Change in first-dose HPV vaccine coverage and series completion were estimated among 11- to 12-year-olds using generalized estimating equations adjusted for age and sex. RESULTS: HPV vaccine coverage in the intervention departments increased from 41% to 59%, and the increase was significantly greater than that seen in the control departments (32%-45%, p = .0002). The largest increase occurred in the quarter after completion of the provider and staff education and a patient reminder and recall postcard mailing (p = .004). Series completion also increased significantly system wide among adolescents aged 11-12 years following mailing of HPV vaccine reminder letters to parents of adolescents aged 12 years rather than 16 years. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccine uptake can be improved through a multifaceted approach that includes provider and staff education and patient reminder/recall. System-level change to optimize reminder and recall notices can have substantial impact on HPV vaccine utilization.",0
1160,"Increasing HPV vaccination rates may decrease the disproportionately high HPV-associated disease incidence and mortality in African Americans (AA) and lower socioeconomic individuals. Data from a community-based participatory research (CBPR) study addressing immunization disparities among 19-35 month old children was analyzed to identify ancillary benefits in HPV immunization rates for adolescent siblings. Sub-study analysis inclusion criteria: AA (N = 118), 13-17 years old, younger sibling enrolled in parent study, and enrolled ≥ 9 months. Parent/caregiver interventions included: a web-based immunization toolkit with information on age-appropriate vaccines; a multimedia community outreach campaign; and reminder mailings. HPV up-to-date (UTD) status was defined as Wisconsin Immunization Registry (WIR) documentation of at least three HPV vaccines. McNemar's test compared pre/post intervention HPV status. Two dependent proportions testing compared the proportion of adolescents that became UTD in the study cohort, City of Milwaukee, and State of Wisconsin. Parents/caregivers perceived that 92% of adolescents were HPV-UTD, while only 24% had a WIR-verified HPV-UTD status. Baseline UTD status of the younger siblings 19-35 month old 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 antigen series was 63%, which increased to 86% at study completion. Adolescent's HPV-UTD immunization status increased from 30 (25%) at enrollment to 54 (46%) at study completion [p = 0.004]. A statistically significant larger proportion of adolescents became HPV-UTD in the study cohort (20%) compared to the City of Milwaukee [14%, p = 0.042] and the State of Wisconsin [14%, p = 0.046]. A culturally-tailored CBPR approach targeting parents/caregivers of younger AA children can have significant ancillary benefit to increase HPV immunization rates in adolescent siblings.",0
1161,"OBJECTIVE: To implement and evaluate text message reminders for the second (HPV2) and third (HPV3) vaccine doses. DESIGN: Site-based intervention. SETTING: Nine pediatric sites (5 academic and 4 private) located in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: Parents of adolescents 9-20 years who received HPV1 or HPV2 during the intervention period, January-June 2009. INTERVENTION: Parents who enrolled received up to three weekly text message reminders that their daughter was due for her next vaccine dose. OUTCOME MEASURE: On-time receipt of the next vaccine dose, within one month of its due date. RESULTS: During the intervention period, of 765 eligible HPV vaccine events, 434 enrollment instructions were distributed to parents (56.7% of doses). Parents of 124 adolescent girls (28.6% of those handed instructions) activated text message reminders. Comparing children of parents who enrolled versus those who did not, on-time receipt of next HPV vaccine dose occurred among 51.6% (95% CI 42.8-60.4%) versus 35.0% (95% CI 29.6-40.2%) of adolescents (p=.001). Similarly, among a historical cohort of adolescents, receiving HPV1 or HPV2 in the six months prior to the intervention period, on-time receipt of next vaccine dose was noted for 38.1% (95% CI 35.2-41.0%) (p=.003). Increases in receipt of next vaccine dose among intervention subjects were sustained at 4 months following the vaccine due date. Using a logistic regression model, after controlling for insurance and site of care, intervention subjects were significantly more likely than either control population to receive their next HPV vaccine dose on-time. CONCLUSION: Among those choosing to enroll, text message reminders were an effective intervention to increase on-time receipt of HPV2 or HPV3.",0
1162,"This study evaluated the impact of health system-based outreach and reminders on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series initiation and completion. Parents of 10 to 12 year olds (n = 1805) were randomized to receive either (1) an outreach letter and brochure recommending HPV vaccination followed by automated HPV vaccine reminders or (2) usual care. We interviewed a subset of 50 parents to assess program acceptability. Outcomes were HPV vaccine initiation during the study period and on-time series completion. Rates of HPV vaccine initiation during the study period (July 2015 to August 2016) were similar between the intervention and control groups, but initiation within 120 days of randomization was higher in the intervention group (23.6% and 18.8%, P = .04) as was completion during the study period (10.3% vs 6.8%, P = .04). Reminders for doses 2 and 3 did not affect completion. The program was acceptable to parents. This study provides evidence that health system-based outreach and reminders can improve HPV vaccination.",0
1163,"The US is failing to make substantive progress toward improving rates of human papillomavirus vaccine uptake. While the Healthy People 2020 goal for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is 80%, the three-dose completion rate in the US in 2014 for 13- to 17-year-old females is less than 40%, and the rate for males is just above 20%. Experts point to a number of reasons for the poor HPV vaccination rates including parental concerns about safety, necessity, and timing. However, the evidence refuting these concerns is substantial. Efforts focusing on education and communication have not shown promise, but several population health strategies have reminder/recall systems; practice-focused strategies targeting staff, clinicians, and parents; assessment and feedback activities; and school-based HPV vaccination programs.",0
1164,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is an important tool for cancer prevention. However, vaccination rates in Alabama, a state with high rates of HPV-related cancers, remain below the national average. Our objective was to develop a comprehensive assessment of HPV vaccination in our state, with the goal to make recommendations for tailored multilevel interventions. A multimodal approach with quantitative and qualitative data was used to determine barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination in Alabama. This included a survey of pediatric care providers and structured interviews with pediatricians, parents, nurses and community stakeholders. Two separate investigators evaluated the interview transcripts for major themes that occurred in 65% or more interviews. Major barriers included lack of knowledge, concerns about vaccine safety, and the link between the HPV vaccine and sexuality. Qualitative interviews further revealed barriers such as misinformation received from the internet and parental vaccine hesitancy. Opportunities for increasing vaccination include parental education, establishment of a reminder system, increasing access to HPV vaccine providers, and education for providers. Additional facilitators revealed through interviews included: trust in physicians, using the internet or social media to propagate positive messaging, physicians and clinical staff education, utilizing existing technology more effectively, highlighting nurses' roles as partners in HPV prevention, and the potential of schools as a venue for promotion of the vaccine. Our data are consistent with prior research showing major barriers to HPV vaccination. Several recommendations for optimizing HPV vaccination uptake in Alabama on the patient, provider and system level are given.",0
1165,"BACKGROUND: The initiation and timely completion of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in young women is critical. We compared the initiation and completion of the HPV vaccine among women in 2 community-based networks with electronic health records: 1 with a prompt and reminder system (prompted cohort) and 1 without (unprompted cohort). METHODS: Female patients aged 9 to 26 years seen between March 1, 2007, and January 25, 2010, were used as the retrospective cohort. Patient demographics and vaccination dates were extracted from the electronic health records. RESULTS: Patients eligible for the vaccine included 6019 from the prompted cohort and 9096 from the unprompted cohort. Mean age at initiation was 17.3 years in the prompted cohort and 18.1 years in the unprompted cohort. Significantly more (P < .001) patients initiated the vaccine in the prompted cohort (34.9%) compared with the unprompted cohort (21.5%). African Americans aged 9 to 18 years with ≥3 visits during the observation period were significantly more likely to initiate in the prompted cohort (P < .001). The prompted cohort was significantly more likely (P < .001) to complete the vaccine series in a timely manner compared with the unprompted cohort. CONCLUSION: More patients aged 9 to 26 years initiated and achieved timely completion of the HPV vaccine series in clinics using an electronic health record system with prompts compared with clinics without prompts.",0
1166,"OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on interventions to increase HPV vaccinations and assess whether The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommendations are supported by current evidence. METHODS: We used a PubMed search to identify studies that assessed interventions that looked at provider assessment and feedback, provider reminders, client reminder and recall, and clinic based education programs. RESULTS: Of the 13 studies identified, 8 included client reminder and recall interventions, 4 included provider assessment and feedback and/or provider reminders and 2 included clinic based education. 11 of the 13 studies demonstrated a positive effect on HPV vaccine initiation or completion. Provider assessment and feedback studies were more likely to report a positive effect on HPV vaccine initiation than on series completion, while client reminder recall interventions more frequently produced an effect on series completion than on initiation. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to support the application of the Community Preventive Services Task Force recommendations specifically to HPV vaccination both for client reminder and recall programs and for provider assessment and feedback interventions. Multiple targeted approaches will be needed to substantially impact HPV vaccine rates.",0
1167,"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Uptake of human papillomavirus ( HPV) vaccine remains low among adolescents in the United States. We sought to assess barriers to HPV vaccine provision in school health centers to inform subsequent interventions. METHODS We conducted structured interviews in the fall of 2010 with staff from all 33 school health centers in North Carolina that stocked HPV vaccine. RESULTS Centers had heterogeneous policies and procedures. Out-of-pocket costs for children and youth to receive privately purchased HPV vaccine were a key barrier to providing HPV vaccine within school health centers. Other barriers included students not returning consent forms, costs to clinics of ordering and stocking privately purchased HPV vaccine, and difficulty using the statewide immunization registry. Most (82%) school health centers were interested in hosting interventions to increase HPV vaccine uptake, especially those that the centers could implement themselves, but many had limited staff to support such efforts. Activities rated as more likely to raise HPV vaccine uptake were student incentives, parent reminders, and obtaining consent from parents while they are at school (all ps < .05). CONCLUSIONS Although school health centers reported facing several key barriers to providing HPV vaccine, many were interested in partnering with outside organizations on low-cost interventions to increase HPV vaccine uptake among adolescents.",0
1168,"Vaccination reminders must both inform and persuade, and text messages designed for this purpose must do so in 160 characters or less. We tested a strategy for improving the impact of HPV vaccination text message reminders through strategic wording. In an experiment conducted in community settings, 167 Spanish-speaking Latina mothers reviewed text message reminders that assigned the cause or ""agency"" for HPV transmission to their daughters or the virus, and assigned protection agency to the mothers or the vaccine. Reminder messages framing transmission as an action of the virus prompted mothers to perceive the threat as more severe than messages describing their daughters as the cause. Assigning transmission agency to the virus also held a persuasive advantage in boosting mothers' intentions to seek vaccination, particularly when the message cast mothers as agents of protection rather than the vaccine.",0
1169,"OBJECTIVES: Completion rates for the human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) series among adolescents remain low. Effectiveness of recall with parents choosing the method (preference-based recall) for increasing HPV series completion is unstudied. Within a cluster-randomized trial, we examined effectiveness of preference-based recall compared with usual care for increasing series completion and the association of recall choices with completion. METHODS: All Kaiser Permanente Colorado pediatric practices (n = 7) were randomized to intervention (n = 4) or control (n = 3) by using covariate-constrained randomization. From January to June 2013, parents at intervention practices whose adolescents received HPV 1 were asked the recall method they preferred for subsequent doses and if they also wanted their child reminded. Completion rates were assessed 1 year after HPV 1. RESULTS: At intervention practices, 374 (43%) of 867 patients were enrolled; 39% preferred text, 18% e-mail, 9% auto-dialer, and 34% 2-methods; 19% chose to have adolescent also recalled. Intervention adolescents were more likely to complete (63% vs 38%) than were controls (adjusted risk ratio 1.47 [1.38-1.57]) and less likely to be late in completing the series (45% vs 57%, P = .02). Rates of completion were similar between different recall methods, but significantly higher for those preferring e-mail and phone compared withother methods (90% vs 60%. P = .008). Completion rates were similar for adolescents who also received recalls (62%) versus those who did not (63%). CONCLUSIONS: Preference-based recall was effective in increasing HPV series completion rates, with point estimates substantially higher than for most published studies of reminder/recall.",0
1170,"The purpose of this systematic review is to identify, describe and assess the potential effectiveness of strategies to respond to issues of vaccine hesitancy that have been implemented and evaluated across diverse global contexts. METHODS: A systematic review of peer reviewed (January 2007-October 2013) and grey literature (up to October 2013) was conducted using a broad search strategy, built to capture multiple dimensions of public trust, confidence and hesitancy concerning vaccines. This search strategy was applied and adapted across several databases and organizational websites. Descriptive analyses were undertaken for 166 (peer reviewed) and 15 (grey literature) evaluation studies. In addition, the quality of evidence relating to a series of PICO (population, intervention, comparison/control, outcomes) questions defined by the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy (WG) was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria; data were analyzed using Review Manager. RESULTS: Across the literature, few strategies to address vaccine hesitancy were found to have been evaluated for impact on either vaccination uptake and/or changes in knowledge, awareness or attitude (only 14% of peer reviewed and 25% of grey literature). The majority of evaluation studies were based in the Americas and primarily focused on influenza, human papillomavirus (HPV) and childhood vaccines. In low- and middle-income regions, the focus was on diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, and polio. Across all regions, most interventions were multi-component and the majority of strategies focused on raising knowledge and awareness. Thirteen relevant studies were used for the GRADE assessment that indicated evidence of moderate quality for the use of social mobilization, mass media, communication tool-based training for health-care workers, non-financial incentives and reminder/recall-based interventions. Overall, our results showed that multicomponent and dialogue-based interventions were most effective. However, given the complexity of vaccine hesitancy and the limited evidence available on how it can be addressed, identified strategies should be carefully tailored according to the target population, their reasons for hesitancy, and the specific context.",0
1171,"BACKGROUND: Each year, human papillomavirus (HPV) causes 30,000 cancers in the USA despite the availability of effective and safe vaccines. Uptake of HPV vaccine has been low and lags behind other adolescent vaccines. This protocol describes a multilevel intervention to improve HPV vaccination rates. METHODS: Using a cluster randomized trial, we will evaluate the independent and combined impact of two evidence-based implementation strategies with innovative enhancements on HPV vaccination rates for female and male patients. The clusters are six primary care sites providing care to pediatric populations. We will use a stepped-wedge cluster randomized design, including process evaluation, to test the hypothesis that compared with the current course of care and a practice-level intervention using reminder-recall interventions coupled with provider-level audit and feedback with education increases HPV vaccination rates in exposed clusters. The factorial design allows us to use a single trial to test these two interventions and to assess each individually and in combination. Our design has four 12-month steps. The first step will be a baseline period; data collected during it will provide a within-practice control group for each cluster. Second, two clusters will be randomly assigned to receive intervention 1 (reminder and recall), and two clusters will be randomly selected to receive intervention 2 (audit and feedback with education). Third, the other two clusters will be randomly allocated to intervention 1 or 2. Clusters initially with intervention 1 will be randomly allocated to 1 + 2 or 1; clusters initially with intervention 2 will be randomly allocated to 1 + 2 or 2. Fourth, all clusters will receive both interventions. To ensure balance of patient numbers across interventions, we will use block randomization at the first step, with the six clusters grouped into three pairs according to volume. Our primary outcome will be vaccination rates. DISCUSSION: Results of our clinical trial and process evaluation will provide evidence showing whether practice- and provider-level interventions improve HPV vaccination rates and will offer insight into contextual factors associated with direction and magnitude of trial outcomes.

1172,"OBJECTIVES: Public health authorities have the resources to conduct efficient immunization reminder interventions to improve vaccine uptake. The objective of this initiative was to design and implement a cost-effective centralized HPV vaccine reminder using New York State Immunization Information System data as one of five prespecified activities to increase initiation and completion among 11- to 13-year-old adolescents. METHODS: The New York State Department of Health sent reminder letters to the parents or guardians of eligible adolescents who were due for the first dose of HPV vaccine and observed HPV vaccine administration in the six months after each mailing. Subjects were randomized into an intervention group, mailed on May 14, 2015 and a control group, mailed on December 8, 2015. RESULTS: The analysis consisted of 81,558 eligible letter recipients. Letter recipients were 2 percent more likely to initiate vaccination than control subjects. Significant increases in vaccine uptake were observed for all age and gender strata. The intervention cost was $30.95 for each adolescent who initiated the HPV vaccine series. New York State Department of Health received far less public feedback, including negative feedback, about this intervention that was originally anticipated. CONCLUSIONS: Public health entities can effectively utilize existing resources to conduct large-scale reminder interventions targeting a jurisdiction's entire 11- to 13-year-old population.",0
1173,"INTRODUCTION: A quality improvement project was undertaken to determine if an evidence-based educational brochure and reminder system can increase human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake and dose completion rates. METHOD: Development of a brochure to promote HPV vaccine uptake was based on predictors of parental acceptance and Health Belief Model concepts. Electronic alerts prompted telephone reminders for dose completion. This quality improvement project utilized a quasi-experimental design with 24 parents of preteen girls from a private pediatric practice and a historical control group of 29 parents. HPV vaccine rates were compared between the groups. RESULTS: A significant difference in HPV vaccine uptake (χ(2) = 11.668, P = .001; odds ratio [OR] = 9.429, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.686-33.101) and dose completion (χ(2) = 16.171, P < .001; OR = 22.500, 95% CI = 4.291-117.990) rates were found between the historical control and intervention groups. Parents who received the clinical protocol were 9.4 times and 22.5 times more likely to have HPV vaccine uptake and dose completion, respectively. DISCUSSION: Low national HPV vaccine rates demonstrate the need for theory-based vaccine delivery programs. These results show that an evidence-based educational brochure and reminder system appeared to improve HPV vaccine uptake and dose completion rates at this private pediatric practice.",0
1174,"OBJECTIVE: Though an essential pediatric preventive service, immunizations are challenging to deliver reliably. Our objective was to measure the impact on pediatric immunization rates of providing clinicians with electronic health record-derived immunization prompting. METHODS: Operating in a large, urban, hospital-based pediatric primary care clinic, we evaluated 2 interventions to improve immunization delivery to children ages 2, 6, and 13 years: point-of-care, patient-specific electronic clinical decision support (CDS) when children overdue for immunizations presented for care, and provider-specific bulletins listing children overdue for immunizations. RESULTS: Overall, the proportion of children up to date for a composite of recommended immunizations at ages 2, 6, and 13 years was not different in the intervention (CDS active) and historical control (CDS not active) periods; historical immunization rates were high. The proportion of children receiving 2 doses of hepatitis A immunization before their second birthday was significantly improved during the intervention period. Human papillomavirus (HPV) immunization delivery was low during both control and intervention periods and was unchanged for 13-year-olds. For 14-year-olds, however, 4 of the 5 highest quarterly rates of complete HPV immunization occurred in the final year of the intervention. Provider-specific bulletins listing children overdue for immunizations increased the likelihood of identified children receiving catch-up hepatitis A immunizations (hazard ratio 1.32; 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.56); results for HPV and the composite of recommended immunizations were of a similar magnitude but not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In our patient population, with high baseline uptake of recommended immunizations, electronic health record-derived immunization prompting had a limited effect on immunization delivery. Benefit was more clearly demonstrated for newer immunizations with lower baseline uptake.",0
1175,"PURPOSE: To study the impact on adolescent immunization rates of direct messages to parents/guardians. METHODS: Electronic health record rules identified adolescents needing an immunization. Parents/guardians of adolescents were messaged via a single vendor using automated text, prerecorded voice, and/or postcard. RESULTS: Parents/guardians of 3,393 patients, ages 11-18 years, with one or more primary care visits in the prior 2 years, identified as needing (average of 2.04 years) a vaccination (meningococcal conjugate, human papillomavirus, or tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines) were messaged (mean age, 14 years; 50% male; 38% African-American; 23% white; 19% Hispanic; and 79% public health insurance). A total of 7,094 messages were sent: 3,334 automated voice (47%), 2,631 texts (37%), and 1,129 postcards (16%). After the first message, 865 adolescents (25.5%) received at least one vaccine. Within 24 weeks of messaging 1,324 vaccines (745 human papillomavirus; 403 meningococcal conjugate; and 176 tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines) occurred in 959 visits (83.8% physician visits and 16.2% nurse visits). Average visits generated $204 gross reimbursement for $1.77 in messaging expenses per vaccine given. No differences in immunization completion rates occurred by age, gender, race/ethnicity, or insurance type. At 24 weeks, one message was more effective than two or three messages (35.6%, 19.4%, and 24.1% effectiveness, respectively; p < .0001). Texts and postcards correlated with more vaccination visits (38.8% and 40.1%, respectively) than phone calls (31.5%; p = .04). More vaccines due led to increasing message effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Automated texts, voice messages, and postcards had a significant positive effect on vaccination rates in adolescents needing vaccination and required minimal financial expenditure.",0
1176,"OBJECTIVE: Latino populations, particularly Mexican-Americans who comprise 65% of the Latinos in the U.S., are disproportionately affected by HPV-related diseases. The HPV vaccination completion rates remain low, well below the Healthy People 2020 goal. In this study we assessed the effect of parental education and a text messaging reminder service on HPV vaccine completion rates among eligible children of Mexican American parents. STUDY DESIGN: Nonequivalent group study of Mexican parents of HPV vaccine eligible children attended the Health Window program at the Mexican Consulate in New York City, a non-clinical, trusted community setting, during 2012-2013. 69 parents received HPV education onsite, 45 of whom also received a series of text message vaccination reminders. We measured HPV vaccination completion of the youngest eligible children of Mexican parents as the main outcome. RESULTS: 98% of those in the education plus text messaging group reported getting the first dose of the vaccine for their child and 87% among those in the educational group only (p = 0.11). 88% of those receiving the 1st dose in the text messaging group reported completing the three doses versus 40% in the educational group only (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Parental text messaging plus education, implemented in a community based setting, was strongly associated with vaccine completion rates among vaccine-eligible Mexican American children. Although pilot in nature, the study achieved an 88% series completion rate in the children of those who received the text messages, significantly higher than current vaccination levels.",0
1177,"BACKGROUND: Disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality signify the need for intervention efforts targeting Korean American immigrant women. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how a culturally targeted and tailored mobile text messaging intervention, mobile screening (mScreening), was developed to promote the uptake of Papanicolaou tests and human papillomavirus vaccine among young Korean American immigrant women. METHODS: Guided by the Fogg behavior model, the mScreening intervention was developed through a series of focus groups. Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis was used to identify core themes. RESULTS: Overall, 4 themes were identified: (1) tailored message content (ie, basic knowledge about cervical cancer), (2) an interactive and visual message format (ie, age-appropriate and friendly messages using emoticons), (3) brief message delivery formats to promote participant engagement, and (4) use of an incentive to motivate participation (ie, gift cards). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the processes of gathering culturally relevant information to develop a mobile phone text messaging intervention and incorporating the target population's perspectives into the development of the intervention. The findings of the study could help guide future intervention development targeting different types of cancer screening in other underserved racial or ethnic groups.",0
1178,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a managed care-based patient reminder/recall system on immunization rates and preventive care visits among low-income adolescents. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial between December 2009 and December 2010 that assigned adolescents aged 11-17 years to one of three groups: mailed letter, telephone reminders, or control. Publicly insured youths (n = 4115) were identified in 37 participating primary care practices. The main outcome measures were immunization rates for routine vaccines (meningococcus, pertussis, HPV) and preventive visit rates at study end. RESULTS: Intervention and control groups were similar at baseline for demographics, immunization rates, and preventive visits. Among adolescents who were behind at the start, immunization rates at study end increased by 21% for mailed (P < .01 vs control), 17% for telephone (P < .05), and 13% for control groups. The proportion of adolescents with a preventive visit (within 12 months) was: mailed (65%; P < .01), telephone (63%; P < .05), and controls (59%). The number needed to treat for an additional fully vaccinated adolescent was 14 for mailed and 25 for telephone reminders; for an additional preventive visit, it was 17 and 29. The intervention cost $18.78 (mailed) or $16.68 (phone) per adolescent per year to deliver. The cost per additional adolescent fully vaccinated was $463.99 for mailed and $714.98 for telephone; the cost per additional adolescent receiving a preventive visit was $324.75 and $487.03. CONCLUSIONS: Managed care-based mail or telephone reminder/recall improved adolescent immunizations and preventive visits, with modest costs and modest impact.",0
1179,"BACKGROUND: Despite numerous public health campaigns to promote the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, uptake among adolescents in the US has remained below the Healthy People 80% goal for 3-dose completion. The Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH) used an innovative social media strategy to raise awareness and increase rates of HPV immunization initiation and series completion among adolescents. METHODS: Between June 2012 and July 2013, PDPH launched a Facebook campaign to target Philadelphia adolescents (13-18 years) with specific messages about HPV immunization benefits and announce opportunities for vaccination. Six distinct advertising campaigns ran for two-week intervals. Facebook metrics and vaccine clinic data were used to track success. Reminder-recall letters were also sent to adolescents as part of the campaign. RESULTS: On average, each advertising campaign reached 155,110 adolescents and engaged 2106 adolescents. The advertising campaigns that focused on HPV disease risk and local resources were the most successful in engaging adolescents. During advertising campaigns, there were sizeable increases in both reach and engagement compared to non-campaign periods. Overall, 3400 adolescents became fans of the campaign and 176 doses of HPV vaccine were administered to 152 adolescents. Only 2 adolescents were vaccinated as a result of the Facebook campaign while the rest were prompted by reminder-recall letters or through community events. CONCLUSION: The campaign was well-received, far-reaching and generated awareness and conversations among adolescents. However, the campaign did not appear to be a sufficient driver for HPV uptake even when common barriers to HPV immunization were minimized.",0
1180,"BACKGROUND: Many preventable behaviors contribute to adolescent mortality and morbidity. Non-adherence to preventive measures represents a challenge and has been associated with worse health outcomes in this population. The widespread use of electronic communication technologies by adolescents, particularly the use of text messaging (short message service, SMS) and mobile phones, presents new opportunities to intervene on risk and preventive risk behavior, but little is known about their efficacy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically evaluate evidence for the efficacy of text messaging and mobile phone app interventions to improve adherence to preventive behavior among adolescents and describe intervention approaches to inform intervention development. METHODS: This review covers literature published between 1995 and 2015. Searches included PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, CINAHL, INSPEC, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and additional databases. The search strategy sought articles on text messaging and mobile phone apps combined with adherence or compliance, and adolescents and youth. An additional hand search of related themes in the Journal of Medical Internet Research was also conducted. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed full-text articles, and extracted data from articles that met inclusion criteria. Included studies reflect original research-experimental or preexperimental designs with text messaging or mobile phone app interventions-targeting adherence to preventive behavior among adolescents (12-24 years old). The preferred reporting items of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed for reporting results, and findings were critically appraised against the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine criteria. RESULTS: Of 1454 records, 19 met inclusion criteria, including text messaging (n=15) and mobile phone apps (n=4). Studies targeted clinic attendance, contraceptive use, oral health, physical activity and weight management, sun protection, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, smoking cessation, and sexual health. Most studies were performed in the United States (47%, 9/19), included younger adolescents (63%, 12/19), and had sample size <100 (63%, 12/19). Although most studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 58%, 11/19), only 5 followed an intent-to-treat analysis. Only 6 of 19 studies (32%) incorporated a theoretical framework in their design. Most studies reported good feasibility with high acceptability and satisfaction. About half of the included studies (42%, 8/19) demonstrated significant improvement in preventive behavior with moderate standardized mean differences. As early efforts in this field to establish feasibility and initial efficacy, most studies were low to moderate in quality. Studies varied in sample size and methods of preventive behavior adherence or outcome assessment, which prohibited performing a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the promising feasibility and acceptability of text messaging and mobile phone apps in improving preventive behavior among adolescents, overall findings were modest in terms of efficacy. Further research evaluating the efficacy, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of these intervention approaches in promoting preventive behavior among adolescents is needed.",0
1181,"HIV infected patients have higher rates of HPV infection, worse disease progression, increase severity of disease, and are at higher risk for intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer than their HIV negative counterparts. We conducted a yearlong pilot project to evaluate the impact of text message HPV immunization reminder-recall in young HIV-1 positive patients in a large urban academic HIV clinic. We found that text message reminder-recall improved HPV immunization uptake in a young, primarily black and un- or under-insured HIV-1 infected patients. As communication by texting is characteristic of teens and young adults in the general population, text message reminder-recalls should be considered a viable option to improve vaccination rates among young HIV patients.",0
1182,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether automated reminders increase on-time completion of the three-dose human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series. METHODS: Ten reproductive health centers enrolled 365 women aged 19-26 to receive dose one of the HPV vaccine. Health centers were matched and randomized so that participants received either routine follow-up (control) or automated reminder messages for vaccine doses two and three (intervention). Intervention participants selected their preferred method of reminders - text, e-mail, phone, private Facebook message, or standard mail. We compared vaccine completion rates between groups over a period of 32 weeks. RESULTS: The reminder system did not increase completion rates, which overall were low at 17.2% in the intervention group and 18.9% in the control group (p=0.881). Exploratory analyses revealed that participants who completed the series on-time were more likely to be older (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.31), report having completed a four-year college degree or more (age-adjusted OR=2.51, 95% CI 1.29-4.90), and report three or more lifetime sexual partners (age-adjusted OR=3.45, 95% CI 1.20-9.92). CONCLUSIONS: The study intervention did not increase HPV vaccine series completion. Despite great public health interest in HPV vaccine completion and reminder technologies, completion rates remain low.",0
1183,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of simple and elaborated health care provider (HCP) reminder prompts on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine initiation rates. METHODS: Twenty-nine pediatric HCPs serving 5 pediatric clinics were randomized to 1 of 3 arms: 1) usual practice control, 2) simple reminder prompt, and 3) elaborated reminder prompt, which included suggested language for recommending the early adolescent platform vaccines. Prompts were delivered via a computer-based clinical decision support system deployed in the 5 clinics. Eligible patients were ages 11 to 13 years, had not received HPV vaccine, and were due for meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) vaccine and/or the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis booster (Tdap). Receipt of HPV vaccine was determined via automated queries sent to the Indiana immunization registry. Data were analyzed via logistic regression models, with generalized estimating equations used to account for the clustering of patients within HCPs. RESULTS: Ten HCPs in the control group saw 301 patients, 8 HCPs in the simple prompt group saw 124, and 11 HCPs in the elaborated prompt group saw 223. The elaborated prompt arm had a higher rate of HPV vaccination (62%) than the control arm (45%): adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 7.14. The simple prompt arm did not differ significantly from the control arm with respect to HPV vaccine initiation, which might have been because of the small sample size for this arm. MenACWY and Tdap rates did not vary across the 3 arms. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that an elaborated HCP-targeted reminder prompt, with suggested recommendation language, might improve rates of HPV vaccine initiation.",0
1184,"OBJECTIVES: To test the feasibility and efficacy of a culturally-tailored mobile health intervention designed to increase knowledge about, intent to obtain, and receipt of the HPV vaccine. METHODS: A 7-day text message HPV intervention was developed using a quasi-experimental research design for 30 Korean-American women. RESULTS: Participants demonstrated significant increases in knowledge of HPV with an intent to get vaccinated within one year, and 30% of participants received the first dose of the HPV vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile health technology could be a promising tool in reducing the cancer burden for underserved populations.",0
1185,"OBJECTIVES: In view of declining screening uptake in young women, this review aims to summarise the available evidence relating to interventions designed to increase cervical screening uptake amongst women aged ≤ 35 years. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched and further articles located by manual searches. Study designs employing a valid comparison group and including women aged ≤ 35 years published through 2012 were considered. Data was extracted on the uptake from either screening programme statistics or as reported by the study subjects. A narrative synthesis was undertaken for each category of interventions identified. RESULTS: Ninety-two records were screened with 36 articles retrieved for further assessment. Four studies met the inclusion criteria, two of which evaluated more than one intervention. One of the studies evaluated the use of a modified invitation letter and reported no significant increase in uptake compared to a standard invitation. Three studies investigated the use of a reminder letter, with two reporting a positive effect on screening uptake in women aged 24-34. Three studies were included which supported the use of physician and telephone reminders. One study on HPV self-sampling reported a positive effect when compared with a reminder letter. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of randomised controlled trials designed to specifically address falling cervical screening uptake in amongst young women. Cervical screening programmes need to look beyond the use of invitation/reminders letters in this group of women to develop interventions which attempt to overcome as many barriers to uptake as possible.",0
1186,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most frequently diagnosed sexually transmitted infection in the United States. It is associated with the development of cervical, anal-genital, and oral-pharyngeal cancers. The rate of HPV infection among adolescents and young adults in the United States remains high, and completion rates of an HPV vaccine series remain low. At an urban pediatric clinic, adolescent and young adult participants aged 11 to 22 years (n = 37) received text message reminders for their second and third dose of HPV vaccine over an 8-month study period. Of the participants receiving text message reminders, 14% completed the vaccine series at the optimal time, whereas 0% of an interested group (n = 43) and only 3% of a standard care group (n = 232) completed the vaccine series at the optimal time. Findings support the use of text message reminders to improve HPV vaccine series completion rates in a pediatric practice.",0
1187,"OBJECTIVE: To examine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine intent and the effect of an educational intervention on vaccine uptake among female college students. PARTICIPANTS: Females aged 18 to 26 attending a university health service gynecology clinic (n = 256). METHODS: Participants were randomized to receive either HPV-specific education with a mailed reminder or standard care. Predictors of HPV vaccine intent and uptake at 6 months following enrollment were identified. RESULTS: At baseline, 41% intended to undergo HPV vaccination. Participants who were currently sexually active and lacked supplemental health insurance had decreased intent. Perceived parental approval regarding HPV vaccination, perceived vulnerability to HPV infection, and belief in health benefits of HPV vaccine were associated with increased intent. HPV vaccine uptake was low (5.5%) and did not differ by study group. However, baseline intent was significantly associated with HPV vaccine uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to increase HPV vaccine uptake in college students should address HPV-related beliefs and broader barriers to vaccination.",0
1188,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection globally. High-risk HPV types can cause cervical cancer, other anogenital cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer; low-risk HPV types can cause genital warts. Cervical cancer is highly preventable through HPV vaccination and screening; however, a lack of awareness and knowledge of HPV and these preventive strategies represents an important barrier to reducing the burden of the disease. The rapid development and widespread use of mobile technologies in the last few years present an opportunity to overcome this lack of knowledge and create new, effective, and modern health communication strategies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the development of a mobile app called FightHPV, a game-based learning tool that educates mobile technology users about HPV, the disease risks associated with HPV infection, and existing preventive methods. METHODS: The first version of FightHPV was improved in a design-development-evaluation loop, which incorporated feedback from a beta testing study of 40 participants, a first focus group of 6 participants aged between 40 and 50 years and a second focus group of 23 participants aged between 16 and 18 years. Gameplay data from the beta testing study were collected using Google Analytics (Google), whereas feedback from focus groups was evaluated qualitatively. Of the 29 focus group participants, 26 returned self-administered questionnaires. HPV knowledge before and after playing the game was evaluated in the 22 participants from the second focus group who returned a questionnaire. RESULTS: FightHPV communicates concepts about HPV, associated diseases and their prevention by representing relationships among 14 characters in 6 episodes of 10 levels each, with each level being represented by a puzzle. Main concepts were reinforced with text explanations. Beta testing revealed that many players either failed or had to retry several times before succeeding at the more difficult levels in the game. It also revealed that players gave up at around level 47 of 60, which prompted the redesign of FightHPV to increase accessibility to all episodes. Focus group discussions led to several improvements in the user experience and dissemination of health information in the game, such as making all episodes available from the beginning of the game and rewriting the information in a more appealing way. Among the 26 focus group participants who returned a questionnaire, all stated that FightHPV is an appealing educational tool, 69% (18/26) reported that they liked the game, and 81% (21/26) stated that the game was challenging. We observed an increase in HPV knowledge after playing the game (P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: FightHPV was easy to access, use, and it increased awareness about HPV infection, its consequences, and preventive measures. FightHPV can be used to educate people to take action against HPV and cervical cancer.",0
1189,"OBJECTIVES: To study the association of using an electronic health record (EHR)'s clinical reminder functionality with increased human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine administration among US office-based physicians. STUDY DESIGN: National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data from 2007-2012 were pooled together to determine if EHR systems that employ clinical reminders are associated with increased immunization rates in different populations. METHODS: The administration of HPV vaccine served as the dependent variable, with the EHR reminder being the primary independent variable of interest. Logit regression was used to assess the relationship between using EHR reminders and HPV vaccine administration. RESULTS: Analyses indicated that compared with physicians without clinical reminder functions, physicians with clinical reminder functions were more likely to order HPV vaccines. Clinical reminder functions were particularly effective at increasing HPV vaccine use among adolescent males. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, physicians who report using clinical reminders were more likely to order HPV immunizations. However, the association of clinical reminders with HPV immunizations was not significant in the younger adolescent subpopulation. Further, given that HPV incidence decreases significantly even with small gains in vaccination rates, the increase in HPV immunizations found in the male population aged 11 to 21 years is promising. Therefore, targeting males to receive HPV vaccination immunizations through clinical reminders provides a positively disproportionate return on vaccination rates and disease burden.",0
1190,"OBJECTIVE: Adolescent immunization rates are suboptimal. Experts recommend provider prompts at health care visits to improve rates. We assessed the impact of either electronic health record (EHR) or nurse- or staff-initiated provider prompts on adolescent immunization rates. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial, allocating practices in 1 of 2 practice-based research networks (PBRN) to provider prompts or standard-of-care control. Ten primary care practices participated, 5 intervention and 5 controls, each matched in pairs on urban, suburban, or rural location and practice type (pediatric or family medicine), from a PBRN in Greater Rochester, New York (GR-PBRN); and 12 practices, 6 intervention, 6 controls, similarly matched, from a national pediatric continuity clinic PBRN (CORNET). The study period was 1 year per practice, ranging from June 2011 to January 2013. Study participants were adolescents 11 to 17 years attending these 22 practices; random sample of chart reviews per practice for baseline and postintervention year to assess immunization rates (n = 7,040 total chart reviews for adolescents with >1 visit in a period). The intervention was an EHR prompt (4 GR-PBRN and 5 CORNET practice pairs) (alert) that appeared on providers' computer screens at all office visits, indicating the specific immunizations that adolescents were recommended to receive. Staff prompts (1 GR-PBRN pair and 1 CORNET pair) in the form of a reminder sheet was placed on the provider's desk in the exam room indicating the vaccines due. We compared immunization rates, stratified by PBRN, for routine vaccines (meningococcus, pertussis, human papillomavirus, influenza) at study beginning and end. RESULTS: Intervention and control practices within each PBRN were similar at baseline for demographics and immunization rates. Immunization rates at the study end for adolescents who were behind on immunizations at study initiation were not significantly different for intervention versus control practices for any vaccine or combination of vaccines. Results were similar for each PBRN and also when only EHR-based prompts was assessed. For example, at study end, 3-dose human papillomavirus vaccination rates for GR-PBRN intervention versus control practices were 51% versus 53% (adjusted odds ratio 0.96; 95% confidence interval 0.64-1.34); CORNET intervention versus control rates were 50% versus 42% (adjusted odds ratio 1.06; 95% confidence interval 0.68-1.88). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In both a local and national setting, provider prompts failed to improve adolescent immunization rates. More rigorous practice-based changes are needed.",0
1191,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing attention on immunizations by obstetrician-gynecologists and a need to improve vaccination rates for all women. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a multimodal intervention on rates of immunization with tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap); human papillomavirus (HPV); and influenza in outpatient obstetrics and gynecology clinics. STUDY DESIGN: Immunization rates at 2 clinics were compared pre- and post-implementation of multiple interventions at a public integrated health-care system. Study interventions began on June 6, 2012 and concluded on May 31, 2014; the preimplementation time period used was June 6, 2010 to June 5, 2012. Interventions included stocking of immunizations in clinics, revision and expansion of standing orders, creation of a reminder/recall program, identification of an immunization champion to give direct provider feedback, expansion of a payment assistance program, and staff education. All women aged 15 and older who made a clinic visit during influenza season were included in the influenza cohort; women who delivered an infant during the study time period and had at least 1 prenatal visit within 9 months preceding delivery were included in the Tdap cohort; each clinic visit by a nonpregnant woman aged 15-26 years was assessed and included in the HPV analysis as an eligible visit if the patient was lacking any of the 3 HPV vaccines in the series. The primary outcome was receipt of influenza and Tdap vaccine per current American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines and receipt of HPV vaccine during eligible visits. Influenza and Tdap were assessed with overall coverage rates at the institutional level, and HPV was assessed at the visit level by captured opportunities. All analyses included generalized estimating equations and the primary outcome was assessed with time as a covariate in all models. RESULTS: A total of 19,409 observations were included in the influenza cohort (10,231 pre- and 9178 post-intervention), 2741 in the Tdap cohort (1248 pre- and 1493 post-intervention), and 12,443 in the HPV cohort (7966 pre- and 4477 post-intervention). Our population was largely Hispanic, English-speaking, and publicly insured. The rate of influenza vaccination increased from 35.4% pre-intervention to 46.0% post-intervention (P < .001). The overall rate for Tdap vaccination increased from 87.6% pre-intervention to 94.5% post-intervention until the recommendation to vaccinate during each pregnancy was implemented (z = 4.58, P < .0001). The average Tdap up-to-date rate after that recommendation was 75.0% (z = -5.77, P < .0001). The overall rate of HPV vaccination with an eligible visit increased from 7.1% before to 23.7% after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Using evidence-based practices largely established in other settings, our intervention was associated with increased rates of influenza, Tdap, and HPV vaccination in outpatient underserved obstetrics and gynecology clinics. Integrating such evidence-based practices into routine obstetrics and gynecology care could positively impact preventive health for many women.",0
1192,"BACKGROUND: Direct-to-adolescent text messaging may be a consideration for vaccine reminders, including human papilloma virus (HPV), but no studies have explored the minimum age at which parents would allow adolescents to receive a text message. METHODS: We distributed a survey to parents of 10-17 year olds during any office visit in two practice based research networks in South Carolina and Oklahoma. We asked about parental preference for receiving vaccine reminders for their adolescent, whether they would allow the healthcare provider to directly message their adolescent, and if so, what would be the acceptable minimum age. RESULTS: In 546 surveys from 11 practices, parents of females were more supportive of direct-to-teen text message reminders than were parents of males, (75% v. 60%, p < .001). The median age at which parents would allow direct text messages from physicians' offices was 14 in females compared to 15 in males, p = .049. We found a correlation between the child's age and the youngest age at which parents would allow a direct text message. Of the parents who permitted a text message directly to their adolescent, most reported an allowable age higher than their adolescent's current age until the age of 15. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that direct-to-adolescent text messaging would be allowed by parents for older adolescents. This supports an intervention aimed at older adolescents, such as for receipt of MCV4 dose #2, delayed HPV vaccine series completion and annual influenza vaccination.",0
1193,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers are a significant burden on the US health care system that can be prevented through adolescent HPV vaccination. Despite guidelines recommending vaccination, coverage among US adolescents is suboptimal particularly among underserved patients (uninsured, low income, racial, and ethnic minorities) seen in safety-net health care settings. Many parents are ambivalent about the vaccine and delay making a decision or talking with a provider about it. Self-persuasion-generating one's own arguments for a health behavior-may be particularly effective for parents who are undecided or not motivated to make a vaccine decision. OBJECTIVE: Through a 3-stage mixed-methods protocol, we will identify an optimal and feasible self-persuasion intervention strategy to promote adolescent HPV vaccination in safety-net clinics. METHODS: In Stage 1, we will define content for a tablet-based self-persuasion app by characterizing (1) parents' self-generated arguments through cognitive interviews conducted with parents (n=50) of patients and (2) parent-provider HPV vaccine discussions through audio recordings of clinic visits (n=50). In Stage 2, we will compare the effects of the four self-persuasion intervention conditions that vary by cognitive processing level (parents verbalize vs listen to arguments) and choice of argument topics (parents choose vs are assigned topics) on parental vaccine intentions in a 2 × 2 factorial design randomized controlled trial (n=160). This proof-of-concept trial design will identify which intervention condition is optimal by quantitatively examining basic self-persuasion mechanisms (cognitive processing and choice) and qualitatively exploring parent experiences with intervention tasks. In Stage 3, we will conduct a pilot trial (n=90) in the safety-net clinics to assess feasibility of the optimal intervention condition identified in Stage 2. We will also assess its impact on parent-provider discussions. RESULTS: This paper describes the study protocol and activities to date. Currently, we have developed the initial prototype of the tablet app for English- and Spanish-speaking populations, and completed Stage 1 data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic collaboration between basic and applied behavioral scientists accelerates translation of promising basic psychological research into innovative interventions suitable for underserved, safety-net populations. At project's end, we plan to have a feasible and acceptable self-persuasion intervention that can affect key cancer disparities in the United States through prevention of HPV-related cancers.

1194,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an intervention aimed at increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine completion of the 3-dose series and knowledge. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred sixty-four male and female US college students 18-26 years old who were receiving HPV vaccine dose 1. METHODS: Students were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Intervention participants received the electronic intervention (text/e-mail appointment reminders and education messages) and controls received standard-of-care. Baseline/follow-up survey data were collected. Main outcome measures included vaccine completion and knowledge. RESULTS: HPV vaccine completion across groups were not significantly different for HPV dose 2 (53% vs 52%) and dose 3 (34% vs 32%). Mean knowledge score at follow-up for intervention group was significantly higher (p = .01) than at baseline. No significant differences in knowledge were found for the control group. The biggest predictor of HPV vaccine completion was female gender. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention increased knowledge but not vaccine completion. More research with catch-up age populations is needed.,0
1195,"PURPOSE: Completion rate for the three-dose series of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has generally been low. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a reminder letter intervention on HPV vaccine three-dose series completion. METHODS: Female members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California Health Plan who received at least one dose, but not more than two doses, of the HPV vaccine by February 13, 2013, and who were between ages 9 and 26 years at the time of first HPV vaccination were included. Eighty percent of these females were randomized to receive the reminder letter, and 20% were randomized to receive standard of care (control). The reminder letters were mailed quarterly to those who had not completed the series. The proportion of series completion at the end of the 12-month evaluation period was compared using chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 9,760 females were included in the intervention group and 2,445 in the control group. HPV vaccine series completion was 56.4% in the intervention group and 46.6% in the control groups (p < .001). The effect of the intervention appeared to be stronger in girls aged 9-17 years compared with young women aged 18-26 years at the first dose and in blacks compared with whites. CONCLUSIONS: Reminder letters scheduled quarterly were effective to enhance HPV vaccine series completion among those who initiated the vaccine. However, a large gap in series completion remained despite the intervention. Future studies should address other barriers to series completion, including those at the providers and the health care system level.",0
1196,"OBJECTIVE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates remain low, in part because of missed opportunities (MOs) for vaccination. We used a learning collaborative quality improvement (QI) model to assess the effect of a multicomponent intervention on reducing MOs. METHODS: Study design: pre-post using a QI intervention in 33 community practices and 14 pediatric continuity clinics over 9 months to reduce MOs for HPV vaccination at all visit types. MEASURES: outcome measures comprised baseline and postproject measures of 1) MOs (primary outcome), and 2) HPV vaccine initiation and completion. Process measures comprised monthly chart audits of MOs for HPV vaccination for performance feedback, monthly Plan-Do-Study-Act surveys and pre-post surveys about office systems. INTERVENTION: providers were trained at the start of the project on offering a strong recommendation for HPV vaccination. Practices implemented provider prompts and/or standing orders and/or reminder/recall if desired, and were provided monthly feedback on MOs to assess their progress. ANALYSES: chi-square tests were used to assess changes in office practices, and logistic regression used to assess changes in MOs according to visit type and overall, as well as HPV vaccine initiation and completion. RESULTS: MOs overall decreased (from 73% to 53% in community practices and 62% to 55% in continuity clinics; P < .01, and P = .03, respectively). HPV vaccine initiation increased for both genders in community practices (from 66% to 74% for female, 57% to 65% for male; P < .01), and for male patients in continuity clinics (from 68% to 75%; P = .05). Series completion increased overall in community practices (39% to 43%; P = .04) and for male patients in continuity clinics (from 36% to 44%; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Office systems changes using a QI model and multicomponent interventions decreased rates of MO for HPV vaccination and increased initiation and completion rates among some gender subgroups. A learning collaborative model provides an effective forum for practices to improve HPV vaccine delivery.",0
1197,"BACKGROUND: Effective interventions are needed to address the low rate of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in the United States, particularly among girls and women 16-26 years old. Counseling and offering the vaccine to postpartum patients could be an effective strategy to increase uptake among young women who did not complete the 3-dose series at an earlier age. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this evaluation was to assess the effectiveness of a multicomponent program designed for postpartum women that used patient navigators (PNs) and reminders for follow-up visits to improve uptake and completion of the HPV vaccine series. STUDY DESIGN: As part of standard care, patients ≤26 years of age from Galveston County, Texas, who delivered an infant from November 2012 through June 2014 at a public hospital were counseled and offered the HPV vaccine postpartum. PNs assisted with scheduling follow-up injections during postpartum or well-child visits. A program evaluation was conducted after 20 months. RESULTS: Of 1038 patients approached, only 161 (15.5%) had previously completed the vaccine series. Of the 877 patients who had not completed the series, 661 (75.4%) received at least 1 dose postpartum, with 575 patients receiving their first dose and 86 receiving their second or third doses. By April 2015, initiation rates had increased as a result of this program from 25.4% before the program was initiated to 80.8% and completion rates from 15.5-65.1%. Missed appointments for injections were less likely among those who received text message reminders and more likely among those with ≥2 prior pregnancies. Those who were Hispanic or had received an influenza vaccination in the last year were more likely to initiate and complete the series through this program. Patients who missed ≥1 follow-up appointments were less likely to complete the vaccine series. CONCLUSION: Offering the HPV vaccine postpartum dramatically increased initiation rates among postpartum patients. PN and text messages ensured that a high percentage completed all 3 doses.",0
1198,"We sought to understand young men who have sex with men (YMSM) perspectives and preferred features for a mobile health (mHealth) tool designed to facilitate human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. YMSM were recruited on a popular social/sexual networking app to participate in online focus groups. Discussions were designed to elicit what the men would want in a mHealth tool specific for sexual health and HPV. Demographic data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and focus group data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. Forty-eight YMSM participated. Mean age was 23.4 years, and 70.0% reported their race as Black. Qualitative themes included general HPV knowledge and awareness, current patterns in technology use, desired app qualities, and desired app content. Youth described varying levels of HPV knowledge, utilized apps to engage socially, and for travel, banking, gaming, news and entertainment, and few used apps to facilitate personal health or engage with healthcare systems. Participants desired credible, relatable, secure, and easy to use interfaces that provided sexual health and HPV information in a positive context. They described ways to creatively engage and directly connect youth to health providers. We identified a culturally relevant youth driven approach to facilitate HPV vaccination and sexual health among YMSM.",0
1199,"BACKGROUND: HPV vaccine is effective in preventing several cancers and anogenital warts, yet rates of HPV vaccination series completion in the United States are low. A primary reason identified by parents for vaccinating children against HPV is a health care provider's recommendation. Although most clinicians embrace vaccine recommendations, they are not always carried out evenly and subsequent HPV vaccines are missed. METHODS: Using an electronic health records-based decision support system (CHICA) clinicians were randomized to either usual practice or to receive an automated reminder to recommend the 2nd or 3rd dose of HPV vaccine. The reminder was delivered to clinicians of all intervention group eligible adolescents who had already initiated the vaccine series. Logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1285 clinical encounters were observed across 29 randomized pediatric providers over a 13-month time frame (50.7% control group, 49.3% intervention group). Overall, patients were 44.9% female, 59.4% Black, 22.1% Hispanic, and 48.8% were ages 11-12 yrs. Within the control group, 421 (64.7%) received a subsequent HPV vaccine, compared to 481 (75.9%) (OR: 1.72, (95% CI 1.35-2.19)). Adjusted analysis showed no difference between the groups (aOR 1.52 (95% CI 0.88-2.62)) or when examined by age (11-12yrs aOR 1.66, (95% CI 0.79-3.48)) and 13-17yrs (aOR 1.19, (95% CI 0.76-1.85)) or gender female (aOR 1.39 (95% CI 0.71-2.72)) and males (aOR 1.67 (95% CI 0.95-2.92)). When results were stratified by both age and gender, there was similarly no statistically significant effect between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Automated physician reminders for subsequent 2nd and 3rd doses of HPV vaccination were used. Despite increased rates of vaccination in the intervention group, the differences did not reach the level of statistical significance. Future studies with multifaceted approaches may be needed to examine the efficacy of computer-based reminders.

1200,"The main amyloid-beta (Aβ) variants detected in the human brain are full-length Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 peptides; however, a significant proportion of AD brain Aβ consists also of N-terminal truncated/modified species. The majority of the previous immunotherapeutic strategies targeted the N-terminal immunodominant epitope of the full-length Aβ; however, most of the pathological N-truncated forms of Aβ lack this critical B cell epitope. Recently, virus-like particles (VLPs), self-assembled structures with highly ordered repetitive patterns on their surface and capable of inducing robust immune responses, were applied as a promising platform for various antigen expressions. In this study, we expressed in plants two chimeric HPV16 L1 capsid proteins obtained by introduction of the β-amyloid 11-28 epitope (Aβ 11-28) into the h4 helix or into the coil regions of the L1 protein. The Aβ 11-28 epitope was chosen because it is present in the full-length Aβ 1-42 as well as in the truncated/modified amyloid peptide species. After expression, we assembled the chimerical L1/Aβ 11-28 into a VLP in which the Aβ 11-28 epitope is exposed at very high density (360 times) on the surface of the VLP. The chimeric VLPs elicited in mice Aβ-specific antibodies binding to β-amyloid plaques in APP-tg mouse and AD brains. Our study is the first to demonstrate a successful production in plants and immunogenic properties in mice of chimeric HPV16 L1 VLPs bearing Aβ epitope that may be of potential relevance for the development of multivalent vaccines for a multifactorial disease such as AD.",0
1201,"Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been causally linked to six cancers, and many disproportionately affect minorties. This study reports on the development and effectiveness of an intervention aimed at increasing HPV vaccine uptake among African American and Hispanic pediatric patients in safety-net clinics.Methods: Formative research, community engagement, and theory guided development of the intervention. A clustered, non-randomized controlled pragmatic trial was conducted in four clinics providing healthcare for the underserved in Tennessee, U.S., with two intervention sites and two usual care sites. Patients aged 9-18 years (N = 408) and their mothers (N = 305) enrolled, with children clustered within families. The intervention consisted of two provider/staff training sessions and provision of patient education materials, consisting of a video/flyer promoting HPV vaccine. Medical records were reviewed before/after the initial visit and after 12 months.Results: At the initial visit, provision of patient education materials and provider recommendation were higher at intervention sites versus usual care sites, and receipt of HPV vaccine was higher at intervention sites (45.4% versus 32.9%) but not significantly after adjusting for patient's age and mother's education. Provider recommendation, but not education materials, increased the likelihood of vaccine receipt at the initial visit, although over one-third of intervention mothers cited the flyer/video as motivating vaccination. Completion of the 3-dose series at follow-up was lower in the intervention arm.Conclusions: Future interventions should combine patient education, intensive provider/staff education, and patient reminders. Research should compare patient education focusing on HPV vaccine only versus all adolescent vaccines.Trial Registration: Retrospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02808832 , 9/12/16.",0
1202,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer screening participation remains insufficient in most countries. Our aim was to evaluate whether offering a HPV self-sampling kit, either mailed directly to the woman's home or using timely opt-in procedures for ordering the kit, increased screening participation compared with a standard second reminder. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled effectiveness trial, 9791 Danish women aged 30-64 who were due to receive the second reminder were equally randomized to either: 1) direct mailing of a second reminder and a self-sampling kit (directly mailed group); 2) mailing of a second reminder that offered a self-sampling kit to be ordered by e-mail, text message, phone, or webpage (opt-in group); or 3) mailing of a second reminder to attend regular cytology screening (control group). In an intention-to-treat analysis, we estimated the participation rate at 180 days post intervention, by returning a self-sample or attending regular cytology screening. We calculated the proportion of women with a positive HPV self-sample who attended for cervical cytology triage at the general practitioner within 90 days. RESULTS: Participation was significantly higher in the directly mailed group (38.0%) and in the opt-in group (30.9%) than in the control group (25.2%) (participation difference (PD): 12.8%, 95% CI: 10.6-15.0% and PD: 5.7%, 95% CI: 3.5-7.9%, respectively). Within 90 days, 107 women (90.7%, 95% CI: 83.9-95.3%) with a HPV-positive self-sample attended follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Offering the opportunity of HPV self-sampling as an alternative to regular cytology screening increased participation; the direct mailing strategy was the most effective invitation strategy. A high compliance with follow-up was seen. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials NCT02680262 . Registered 10 February 2016.",0
1203,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined patient-, care team- and clinic-level factors associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine initiation and completion. METHODS: HPV vaccine initiation and completion rates among adolescents aged 9-18years were assessed using administrative data (n=38,277) from a large federally qualified health center serving predominantly Latino patients. Four clinics with particularly high and low adolescent HPV vaccine uptake were selected for in-depth case study analyses. Semi-structured interviews with clinic leaders, providers, and support staff in these clinics (n=36) examined multilevel factors perceived as affecting vaccine initiation and completion. RESULTS: On average, less than half (45%) of patients had initiated the HPV vaccine; of these, 52% of patients completed all recommended doses. Vaccine uptake varied significantly across clinics but was higher among patients seen by providers specializing in pediatrics. Qualitative findings confirmed the importance of provider communication strategies but indicated that other health care team structures and processes also play an important role in vaccine uptake. Care team members in higher performing clinics were more likely to describe vaccination as a team effort rather than solely the provider's responsibility. Support staff in higher performing clinics also spent more time reviewing patient preventive care needs and preparing patients for the provider encounter. Clinic-level factors such as performance management systems and the use of immunization champions were described as important for developing an organizational climate supportive of vaccination. Tracking and reminder systems were described as important but insufficient for ensuring vaccine uptake in the absence of other supports. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve HPV initiation and completion could benefit from additional attention to factors at the health care team and clinic levels. Interventions that target factors at multiple levels of influence are most likely to achieve higher vaccination rates. Quality monitoring programs may influence clinic investment in improving vaccination rates.",0
1204,"Despite the availability of HPV prophylactic vaccines, uptake has been suboptimal in the US. In the state of Hawaii, HPV vaccine coverage has decreased among females and remains low among males aged 13-17. The reasons for low uptake are unknown and may indicate the existence of critical barriers to HPV vaccination. The purpose of this investigation was to identify policy, system and environmental barriers and promoters of pediatric HPV vaccination in Hawaii. An online 86-item survey addressing knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, practices, and barriers to HPV vaccination was distributed to practicing physicians in Hawaii specializing in Pediatrics, Family Medicine, and Obstetrics-Gynecology. Survey responses were received from a total of 120 physicians. Private practice physicians reported more concerns with vaccine ordering and stocking costs (p < 0.0001), reimbursement levels (p < 0.0001), and insurance coverage (p < 0.0001) compared to physicians in large group practices. Eighty-three percent of providers cited lack of parent knowledge and understanding of HPV infection as a barrier. Over half of physicians (58 %) reported that completion of the 3-dose schedule was a barrier. Most physicians did not use tracking or reminder systems to ensure dose completion. A majority (58 %) of providers cited the lack of school-based vaccination requirements as a barrier. Uptake of HPV vaccination in Hawaii may be impeded by physician perception of parent knowledge and attitudes. Cost-related system barriers are particular barriers among those in private practice. Completion of the 3-dose schedule also remains a challenge.",0
1205,"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to determine if cervical cancer screening uptake would increase among under-screened women living in rural Ontario, Canada, if at-home self-collected sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing was offered as a primary cervical cancer screening modality, compared to invited papanicolaou (Pap) testing or routine opportunistic screening. METHODS: Women 30-70 years of age who were overdue for cervical cancer screening were randomized to receive (1) an at-home self-collected HPV kit, (2) a reminder invitation for Pap testing, or (3) standard of care opportunistic screening. The first two arms were also asked demographic and screening history questions. Women randomized to arm 1 were asked about acceptability. RESULTS: In total, 818 eligible women were identified in a small rural community in Southwestern Ontario: 335 received a self-collected HPV testing kit, 331 received a reminder letter, and 152 received standard of care. In the HPV self-collection arm, 21% (70/335) returned the sample and questionnaire and 11% (37/335) opted to undergo Pap testing. In total, 32% from the HPV self-collection arm, 15% (51/331) from the Pap invitation arm, and 8.5% (13/152) with standard of care were screened. Women receiving the self-collected HPV kit were 3.7 (95% confidence interval 2.2-6.4) times more likely to undergo screening compared to the standard of care arm. In the HPV self-sampling arm, 80% (56/70) said they would be very likely to choose self-collected sampling in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Providing self-collected sampling for HPV testing was more effective than sending reminder letters to increase screening coverage in under-screened women.",0
1206,"BACKGROUND: Organized screening based on Pap tests has substantially reduced deaths from cervical cancer in many countries, including Australia. However, the impact of the program depends upon the degree to which women participate. A new method of screening, testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA to detect the virus that causes cervical cancer, has recently become available. Because women can collect their own samples for this test at home, it has the potential to overcome some of the barriers to Pap tests. The iPap trial will evaluate whether mailing an HPV self-sampling kit increases participation by never- and under-screened women within a cervical screening program. METHODS/DESIGN: The iPap trial is a parallel randomized controlled, open label, trial. Participants will be Victorian women age 30-69 years, for whom there is either no record on the Victorian Cervical Cytology Registry (VCCR) of a Pap test (never-screened) or the last recorded Pap test was between five to fifteen years ago (under-screened). Enrolment information from the Victorian Electoral Commission will be linked to the VCCR to determine the never-screened women. Variables that will be used for record linkage include full name, address and date of birth. Never- and under-screened women will be randomly allocated to either receive an invitation letter with an HPV self-sampling kit or a reminder letter to attend for a Pap test, which is standard practice for women overdue for a test in Victoria. All resources have been focus group tested. The primary outcome will be the proportion of women who participate, by returning an HPV self-sampling kit for women in the self-sampling arm, and notification of a Pap test result to the Registry for women in the Pap test arm at 3 and 6 months after mailout. The most important secondary outcome is the proportion of test-positive women who undergo further investigations at 6 and 12 months after mailout of results. DISCUSSION: The iPap trial will provide strong evidence about whether HPV self-sampling could be used in Australia to improve participation in cervical screening for never-and under-screened women.

1208,"BACKGROUND: Attendance in screening is an important determinant of cervical cancer. Previous experience on high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) DNA testing on patient-obtained samples suggests a good effect among nonattendees of screening. We assessed the effects of self-sampling on attendance in the Finnish screening program. METHODS: Nonattendees after the primary invitation in one municipality (Espoo) were randomized to receive either a self-sampling kit (2,397 women) or an extra invitation (6,302 women). One fourth (1,315 women) of reminder letter arm nonattendees also received a self-sampling kit as a third intervention. Main outcomes were increases in screening attendance and coverage. RESULTS: The adjusted relative risk for participation by self-sampling as a second intervention in comparison to a reminder letter arm was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.13-1.30). Total attendance increased from 65% to 76% by self-sampling and from 65% to 74% with a reminder letter. Combining the interventions (reminder letter and then self-sampling) increased total attendance from 63% to 78%. One fifth of the participants in all three groups increased screening coverage (previous Pap smear ≥5 years ago or never). Self-obtained samples were more often HPV positive than provider-obtained ones (participants after primary invitation and reminder letter), 12% to 13% versus 7%. CONCLUSIONS: Self-sampling is a feasible option in enhancing the attendance at organized screening, particularly as an addition to a reminder letter. IMPACT: If self-sampling is used as a third intervention after two written invitations, the overall attendance in Finland could most likely reach the desired 80% to 85%.",0

Self-sampling at home for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as an alternative to a clinical sampling can be a useful policy to increase attendance. To determine whether self-sampling improves screening attendance for women who do not regularly attend the Norwegian Cervical Cancer Screening Programme (NCCSP), 800 women aged 25-69 years in the Oslo area who were due to receive a 2nd reminder to attend regular screening were randomly selected and invited to be part of the intervention group. Women in this group received one of two self-sampling devices, Evalyn Brush or Delphi Screener. To attend screening, women in the intervention group had the option of using the self-sampling device (self-sampling subgroup) or visiting their physician for a cervical smear. Self-sampled specimens were split and analyzed for the presence of high-risk (hr) HPV by the CLART® HPV2 test and the digene® Hybrid Capture (HC)2 test. The control group consisted of 2593 women who received a 2nd reminder letter according to the current guidelines of the NCCSP. The attendance rates were 33.4% in the intervention group and 23.2% in the control group, with similar attendance rates for both self-sampling devices. Women in the self-sampling subgroup responded favorably to both self-sampling devices and cited not remembering receiving a call for screening as the most dominant reason for previous non-attendance. Thirty-two of 34 (94.1%) hrHPV-positive women in the self-sampling subgroup attended follow-up. In conclusion, self-sampling increased attendance rates and was feasible and well received. This study lends further support to the proposal that self-sampling may be a valuable alternative for increasing cervical cancer screening coverage in Norway.",0
1210,"BACKGROUND: High coverage and attendance is essential for cervical cancer screening success. We investigated whether the previous positive experiences on increasing screening attendance by self-sampling in Finland are sampler device dependent. METHODS: All women identified to cervical cancer screening in 2013 in 28 Finnish municipalities were randomised to receive a lavage- (n = 6030) or a brush type of self-sampling device (n = 6045) in case of non-attendance after two invitation letters. Seven hundred seventy non-attending women in the lavage device group and 734 in the brush group received the self-sampling offer. Women's experiences were enquired with an enclosed questionnaire. RESULTS: Total attendance in the lavage group increased from 71.0 to 77.7% by reminder letters and further to 80.5% by self-sampling. Respective increase in the brush group was from 72.2 to 78.6% and then to 81.5%. The participation by self-sampling was 21.7% (95% CI 18.8-24.6) in the lavage group and 23.8% (95% CI 20.8-26.9) in the brush group. Women's self-sampling experiences were mainly positive and the sampler devices were equally well accepted by the women. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the lavage device and brush device perform similarly in terms of uptake by non-attending women and user comfort. If self-sampling is integrated to the routine screening program in Finland, either of the devices can be chosen without the fear of losing participants due to a less acceptable device.",0
1211,"BACKGROUND: We performed a multicentre randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect on participation in organised screening programmes of a self-sampling device mailed home or picked up at a pharmacy compared with the standard recall letter. METHODS: Women aged 30-64 non-responding to screening invitation were eligible. Response rate to first invitation ranged from 30% to 60% between centres. The control was the standard reminder letter to undergo the test used by the programme (Pap test in three centres and HPV DNA test in three other centres). Home mailing of the self-sampler was preceded by a letter with a leaflet about HPV. The analysis was intention-to-treat. RESULTS: In all, 14 041 women were randomised and recruited: 5012 in the control arm, 4516 to receive the self-sampler at home, and 4513 to pick up the self-sampler at a pharmacy. Participation was 11.9% in the control, 21.6% (relative participation: 1.75; 95% CI 1.60-1.93) in home, and 12.0% (relative participation: 0.96; 95% CI 0.86-1.07) in the pharmacy arms, respectively. The heterogeneity between centres was high (excess heterogeneity of that expected due to chance, i.e., I(2), 94.9% and 94.1% for home and pharmacy arm, respectively). The estimated impact on the overall coverage was +4.3% for home mail self-sampling compared with +2.2% for standard reminder. CONCLUSIONS: Home mailing of self-sampler proved to be an effective way to increase participation in screening programmes, even in those with HPV as primary testing. Picking up at pharmacies showed effects varying from centre to centre.",0
1212,"We aimed to identify sociodemographic predictors of compliance after receiving a personalised reminder on lacking vaccinations against MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) and/or HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) among parents of Danish adolescent girls. A nationwide register-based study, including all 14-year-old girls (15 May 2014-14 May 2015) lacking either MMR, HPV-vaccination or both. Vaccination-compliance following a postal reminder was modelled using multivariable logistic regression and included the following socio-demographic predictors: maternal age, education, employment and ethnicity. Birth order, number of siblings, family-structure, location of residence, and household income. The parents of 9692 girls received a reminder. Out of 4940 exclusively lacking an HPV-vaccine, 15.3% were subsequently vaccinated. Among 2026 only lacking an MMR vaccination, 8.5% were vaccinated. Among 2726 girls lacking both, 5% received an HPV, 4.4% an MMR and 5.4% received both vaccinations. We identified sociodemographic differences between reminderletter-compliers and non-compliers, also according to vaccination types. Non-western descendants were more likely to receive HPV-vaccination, although the association was only significant for those who only lacked HPV (OR 2.02, 95% 1.57-2.59). For girls only lacking an MMR, regional differences were identified. Among girls lacking both vaccines, girls of mothers with intermediate (OR 0.63, 0.42-0.95) or basic education (OR 0.43, 0.24-0.75) were less likely to be vaccinated compared to girls of higher educated mothers. Reminders were in particular effective in increasing HPV uptake among immigrants of non-Western ethnicity. We found reminders to be less effective among less educated mothers whose daughters lacked both vaccines. To increase the coverage in this group, additional interventions are needed.",0
1213,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of cervical cancer screening programs is challenged by suboptimal participation and coverage. Offering cervico-vaginal self-sampling for human papillomavirus testing (HPV self-sampling) to non-participants can increase screening participation. However, the effect varies substantially among studies, especially depending on the approach used to offer HPV self-sampling. The present trial evaluates the effect on participation in an organized screening program of a HPV self-sampling kit mailed directly to the home of the woman or mailed to the woman's home on demand only, compared with the standard second reminder for regular screening. METHODS/DESIGN: The CHOiCE trial is a parallel, randomized, controlled, open-label trial. It will include 9327 women aged 30-64 years who are living in the Central Denmark Region and who have not participated in cervical cancer screening after an invitation and one reminder. The women will be equally randomized into three arms: 1) Directly mailed a second reminder including a HPV self-sampling kit; 2) Mailed a second reminder offering a HPV self-sampling kit, to be ordered by e-mail, text message, phone, or through a webpage; and 3) Mailed a second reminder for a practitioner-collected sample (control group). The primary outcome will be the proportion of women in the intervention groups who participate by returning their HPV self-sampling kit or have a practitioner-collected sample compared with the proportion of women who have a practitioner-collected sample in the control group at 90 and 180 days after mail out of the second reminders. Per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses will be performed. The secondary outcome will be the proportion of women with a positive HPV self-collected sample who attend follow-up testing at 30, 60, or 90 days after mail out of the results. DISCUSSION: The CHOiCE trial will provide strong and important evidence allowing us to determine if and how HPV self-sampling can be used to increase participation in cervical cancer screening. This trial therefore has the potential to improve prevention and reduce the number of deaths caused by cervical cancer. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials NCT02680262 .

1214,"PROBLEM/CONDITION: Overall, the prevalence of illness attributable to vaccine-preventable diseases is greater among adults than among children. Adults are recommended to receive vaccinations based on their age, underlying medical conditions, lifestyle, prior vaccinations, and other considerations. Updated vaccination recommendations from CDC are published annually in the U.S. Adult Immunization Schedule. Despite longstanding recommendations for use of many vaccines, vaccination coverage among U.S. adults is low. PERIOD COVERED: August 2014-June 2015 (for influenza vaccination) and January-December 2015 (for pneumococcal, tetanus and diphtheria [Td] and tetanus and diphtheria with acellular pertussis [Tdap], hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, and human papillomavirus [HPV] vaccination). DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a continuous, cross-sectional national household survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. In-person interviews are conducted throughout the year in a probability sample of households, and NHIS data are compiled and released annually. The survey objective is to monitor the health of the U.S. population and provide estimates of health indicators, health care use and access, and health-related behaviors. RESULTS: Compared with data from the 2014 NHIS, increases in vaccination coverage occurred for influenza vaccine among adults aged ≥19 years (a 1.6 percentage point increase compared with the 2013-14 season to 44.8%), pneumococcal vaccine among adults aged 19-64 years at increased risk for pneumococcal disease (a 2.8 percentage point increase to 23.0%), Tdap vaccine among adults aged ≥19 years and adults aged 19-64 years (a 3.1 percentage point and 3.3 percentage point increase to 23.1% and to 24.7%, respectively), herpes zoster vaccine among adults aged ≥60 years and adults aged ≥65 years (a 2.7 percentage point and 3.2 percentage point increase to 30.6% and to 34.2%, respectively), and hepatitis B vaccine among health care personnel (HCP) aged ≥19 years (a 4.1 percentage point increase to 64.7%). Herpes zoster vaccination coverage in 2015 met the Healthy People 2020 target of 30%. Aside from these modest improvements, vaccination coverage among adults in 2015 was similar to estimates from 2014. Racial/ethnic differences in coverage persisted for all seven vaccines, with higher coverage generally for whites compared with most other groups. Adults without health insurance reported receipt of influenza vaccine (all age groups), pneumococcal vaccine (adults aged 19-64 years at increased risk), Td vaccine (adults aged ≥19 years, 19-64 years, and 50-64 years), Tdap vaccine (adults aged ≥19 years and 19-64 years), hepatitis A vaccine (adults aged ≥19 years overall and among travelers), hepatitis B vaccine (adults aged ≥19 years, 19-49 years, and among travelers), herpes zoster vaccine (adults aged ≥60 years), and HPV vaccine (males and females aged 19-26 years) less often than those with health insurance. Adults who reported having a usual place for health care generally reported receipt of recommended vaccinations more often than those who did not have such a place, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Vaccination coverage was higher among adults reporting one or more physician contacts in the past year compared with those who had not visited a physician in the past year, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Even among adults who had health insurance and ≥10 physician contacts within the past year, depending on the vaccine, 18.2%-85.6% reported not having received vaccinations that were recommended either for all persons or for those with specific indications. Overall, vaccination coverage among U.S.-born adults was higher than that among foreign-born adults, with few exceptions (influenza vaccination [adults aged 19-49 years and 50-64 years], hepatitis A vaccination [adults aged ≥19 years], and hepatitis B vaccination [adults aged ≥19 years with diabetes or chronic liver conditions]). INTERPRETATION: Coverage for all vaccines for adults remained low but modest gains occurred in vaccination coverage for influenza (adults aged ≥19 years), pneumococcal (adults aged 19-64 years with increased risk), Tdap (adults aged ≥19 years and adults aged 19-64 years), herpes zoster (adults aged ≥60 years and ≥65 years), and hepatitis B (HCP aged ≥19 years); coverage for other vaccines and groups with vaccination indications did not improve. The 30% Healthy People 2020 target for herpes zoster vaccination was met. Racial/ethnic disparities persisted for routinely recommended adult vaccines. Missed opportunities to vaccinate remained. Although having health insurance coverage and a usual place for health care were associated with higher vaccination coverage, these factors alone were not associated with optimal adult vaccination coverage. HPV vaccination coverage for males and females has increased since CDC recommended vaccination to prevent cancers caused by HPV, but many adolescents and young adults remained unvaccinated. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Assessing factors associated with low coverage rates and disparities in vaccination is important for implementing strategies to improve vaccination coverage. Evidence-based practices that have been demonstrated to improve vaccination coverage should be used. These practices include assessment of patients' vaccination indications by health care providers and routine recommendation and offer of needed vaccines to adults, implementation of reminder-recall systems, use of standing-order programs for vaccination, and assessment of practice-level vaccination rates with feedback to staff members. For vaccination coverage to be improved among those who reported lower coverage rates of recommended adult vaccines, efforts also are needed to identify adults who do not have a regular provider or insurance and who report fewer health care visits.",0
1215,"Rationale: Early and accurate detection of disease is crucial for its prevention, identification, and treatment. However, most of disease diagnostics is still limited in clinical laboratories due to the need of complicated instruments and professional personnel. Herein, we reported a smartphone-based synergistically enhanced colorimetric method for molecular diagnostics in our point of care (POC) smart cup platform. Methods: A disposable microfluidic chip was developed for colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) detection of multiple HPV DNA in our POC smart cup platform. The colorimetric detection takes advantage of synergistic effect of PPi4- and H+ ions, two byproducts of LAMP reaction. Color signal of LAMP assay was recorded and analyzed by our custom Android app (dubbed ""Hue Analyzer""). Results: Our method not only significantly improves colorimetric readout, but also provides a 10-fold increase in detection sensitivity. It has been successfully applied for HPV-associated cancer screening with spiked saliva and clinical swab samples. Conclusion: The proposed POC diagnostic platform is completely compatible with other nucleic acid biomarkers and has great potential for personalized health monitoring and disease prevention.",0
1216,"BACKGROUND: Many adolescents with chronic medical conditions (CMCs) are at risk of vaccine-preventable infection, yet are frequently under-vaccinated. Text message reminders, particularly those with embedded educational information, have been shown to increase general pediatric vaccination. Their use has not been studied specifically among adolescents with CMCs. METHODS: Eligible parents of adolescents with CMCs receiving care at one of 4 academically-affiliated pediatric clinics and requiring human papillomavirus (first dose), influenza, and/or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines were randomized in 4 consecutive cohorts to receive text message vaccine reminders with or without embedded educational information (""educational"" vs. ""plain"" arm, respectively). Educational reminders, including one interactive message, addressed infection risk, vaccine safety/efficacy, and physician recommendations. Up to 5 weekly and 2 booster reminders were sent (October 2014-January 2015). Receipt of any needed vaccine and missed vaccination opportunities by 4, 12, and 24weeks after the initial reminder were compared between arms. RESULTS: Of randomized parents (n=295), 175 (59.3%) were Spanish-speaking; most had adolescents with CMCs who were 13-17years (n=229; 77.6%) and publically insured (n=272; 92.5%). Baseline demographics and parental vaccine beliefs were similar between arms. More adolescents in the plain vs. educational reminder arm received any needed vaccine by 4weeks (31.9% vs. 22.7%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.14), but not by 12 or 24weeks. Plain reminders were noted in post hoc analyses to have a greater effect than educational reminders in certain sub-populations, including 11-12year-olds and those sent the initial reminder in early fall. Fewer adolescents in the plain vs. educational reminder arm had a missed vaccination opportunity by 4weeks (10.9% vs. 41.3%; aRR 0.21, 95% CI 0.07-0.60), but not by 12 or 24weeks. CONCLUSION: Plain text message vaccine reminders appear to have a positive effect compared to educational ones in the short-term and for certain families.

1217,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a major health concern in Tanzania, caused by poor attendance for cervical cancer screening and follow-up of women at risk. Mobile telephone health interventions are proven effective tools to improve health behaviour in African countries. So far, no knowledge exists on how such interventions may perform in relation to cervical cancer screening in low-income settings. This study aims to assess the degree to which a Short Message Service (SMS) intervention can increase attendance at appointments among women who have tested positive for high-risk (HR) Human Papillomavirus (HPV) during cervical cancer screening. METHODS/DESIGN: Connected2Care is a non-blinded, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial. Tanzanian women testing positive to HR HPV at inclusion are randomly assigned in an allocation ratio of 1:1 to the SMS intervention or the control group (standard care). In a period of 10 months, the intervention group will receive 15 one-directional health educative text messages and SMS reminders for their appointment. The total sample size will be 700 with 350 women in each study arm. Primary outcome is attendance rate for follow-up. Secondary objectives are cost-effectiveness, measured through incremental ratios, and knowledge of cervical cancer by a 16-item true/false scale questionnaire at baseline and follow-up. Barriers against implementing the intervention will be assessed in a mixed-methods sub-population study. DISCUSSION: This study may provide information on the potential effects, costs, and barriers in implementing an SMS intervention targeting a group of women who are followed up after testing positive for HR HPV and are, therefore, at increased risk of developing cervical cancer. This can guide decision-makers on the effective use of mobile technology in a low-income setting. Trial status: recruiting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02509702 .

1218,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing allows women to self-collect cervico-vaginal cells at home (i.e., self-sampling). Using primary data from a randomized pilot study, we evaluated the long-term consequences and cost-effectiveness of using self-sampling to improve participation to routine cervical cancer screening in Norway. METHODS: We compared a strategy reflecting screening participation (using reminder letters) to strategies that involved mailing self-sampling device kits to women noncompliant to screening within a 5- or 10-year period under two scenarios: (A) self-sampling respondents had moderate under-screening histories, or (B) respondents to self-sampling had moderate and severe under-screening histories. Model outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and lifetime costs. The ""most cost-effective"" strategy was identified as the strategy just below $100,000 per QALY gained. RESULTS: Mailing self-sampling device kits to all women noncompliant to screening within a 5- or 10-year period can be more effective and less costly than the current reminder letter policy; however, the optimal self-sampling strategy was dependent on the profile of self-sampling respondents. For example, ""10-yearly self-sampling"" is preferred ($95,500 per QALY gained) if ""5-yearly self-sampling"" could only attract moderate under-screeners; however, ""5-yearly self-sampling"" is preferred if this strategy could additionally attract severe under-screeners. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted self-sampling of noncompliers likely represents good value-for-money; however, the preferred strategy is contingent on the screening histories and compliance of respondents. IMPACT: The magnitude of the health benefit and optimal self-sampling strategy is dependent on the profile and behavior of respondents. Health authorities should understand these factors prior to selecting and implementing a self-sampling policy. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(1); 95-103. ©2016 AACR.",0
1219,"BACKGROUND: Offering self-sampling to non-attendees of cervical screening increases screening attendance. METHODS: We used observations from two Finnish studies on the use of self-sampling among the non-attendees to estimate in a hypothetical screening population of 100,000 women the possible costs per extra screened woman and costs per extra detected and treated CIN2+ with three intervention strategies; 1) a primary invitation and a reminder letter, 2) a primary invitation and a mailed self-sampling kit and 3) two invitation letters and a self-sampling kit. The program costs were derived from actual performance and costs in the original studies and a national estimate on management costs of HPV related diseases. RESULTS: The price per extra participant and price per detected and treated CIN2+ lesion was lower with a reminder letter than by self-sampling as a first reminder. When self-sampling was used as a second reminder with a low sampler price and a triage Pap-smear as a follow-up test for HPV-positive women instead of direct colposcopy referral, the eradication of a CIN2+ lesion by self-sampling was not more expensive than in routine screening, and the addition of two reminders to the invitation protocol did not increase the price of an treated CIN2+ lesion in the entire screened population. CONCLUSIONS: As a first reminder, a reminder letter is most likely a better choice. As second reminder, the higher costs of self-sampling might be compensated by the higher prevalence of CIN2+ in the originally non-attending population.",0
1220,"We developed an electronic medical record (EMR)-based HPV vaccine decision support intervention targeting clinicians, (immunization alerts, education, and feedback) and families (phone reminders and referral to an educational website). Through telephone surveys completed by 162 parents of adolescent girls, we assessed the acceptability of the family-focused intervention and its effect on information-seeking behavior, communication, and HPV vaccine decision-making. The intervention was acceptable to parents and 46% remembered receiving the reminder call. Parents reported that the call prompted them to seek out information regarding the HPV vaccine, discuss the vaccine with friends and family, and reach a decision. Parents whose adolescent girls attended practices receiving the clinician-focused intervention were more likely to report that their clinician discussed the HPV vaccine at preventive visits. The results of this study demonstrate the acceptability and potential impact on clinical care of a comprehensive decision support system directed at both clinicians and families.",0
1221,"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer represents a distinct head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) subpopulation, with improved disease-free and overall survival. In general, HPV-positive HNSCCs express wild-type TP53, which could explain its increased radiosensitivity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this higher sensitivity remain elusive. We have previously shown that HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinomas express decreased levels of the NEDD8-activating enzyme 1/amyloid β precursor protein-binding protein 1 (NAE1/APP-BP1) gene. NAE1/APP-BP1 function is required for the NEDDylation of target proteins, and has been shown to be a negative regulator of p53 transcriptional activity. In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that NAE1/APP-BP1 expression levels regulate p53 activity and cell survival upon ionizing irradiation. We used the radiosensitive and naturally HPV16-infected UPCI:SCC90 cell line and the radioresistant and HPV-negative SQ20B cell line as the control. NAE1/APP-BP1 expression levels were modulated with expression constructs and siRNAs. Radiosensitivity was evaluated with clonogenic survival assays. p53 transcriptional activity was measured with a luciferase assay. The overexpression of NAE1/APP-BP1 in UPCI:SCC90 cells resulted in the increased NEDDylation of p53, inhibition of p53 activity and increased cell resistance to ionizing radiation. Conversely, the inhibition of NAE1/APP-BP1 expression in SQ20B cells induced p53-dependent cell death after treatment with X-rays. Taken together, these results indicate that NAE1/APP-BP1 and NEDDylation are invovled in modulating p53 activity and regulating its role in the response of cells to ionizing radiation. Our findings bring new insights in the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased radiosensitivity of HPV-related oropharyngeal tumors. This is of importance, as no reliable and robust predictive biomarkers for tumor response to radiotherapy are currently available. These results also have potential clinical significance, as drugs targeting NAE1/APP-BP1 have recently emerged as a novel therapeutic modality in cancer treatment.",0
1222,"Unacceptable disparities in cervical cancer between richer and poorer countries persist and serve as reminders of gross disparities in access to and quality of screening services. HPV testing is well-suited to address some of the barriers to implementing adequate screening programs in low resource settings. HPV testing has considerably better sensitivity than cytology providing the same extent of safety with fewer rounds of screening. New robust HPV testing platforms require little to no skill by laboratory workers and some can be used at the point-of-care. This allows for a round of screening to be accomplished in one or two visits, reducing costs and the inevitable attrition that occurs when women need to be recalled to obtain their results. HPV testing is ideal for incorporating into the new ""screen-and-treat"" approaches designed to overcome limitations of conventional, multi-visit, colposcopy-based approaches to screening. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) is the screening test that has been used most widely in screen-and-treat programs to date but the performance characteristics of this test are poor. HPV-based screen-and-treat is more effective in reducing disease in the population and reduces over-treatment intrinsic to this approach. HPV testing can be adapted or combined with other molecular tests to improve treatment algorithms. Infrastructure established to support VIA-based screen-and-treat can effectively incorporate HPV testing. We are poised at a critical juncture in public health history to implement HPV testing as part of primary screening and thereby improve women's health in low resource settings.",0

1224,"BACKGROUND: Rates for human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination are low across the United States. Evidence-based-practices to increase immunization coverage have been recommended by public health organizations, yet many primary care clinics do not follow these practices. The purpose of this study was to examine if primary care clinics use these best practices to promote completion of the HPV vaccine series for their adolescent patients. Understanding the prevalence of evidence-based immunization strategies is key to increasing vaccination coverage. METHODS: We mailed 914 surveys to clinic managers of clinics that provide primary care in Iowa. The survey content was based on immunization strategies related to clinic practice and policies that have been proven effective to promote the completion of the HPV vaccination series. RESULTS: Survey responses from 127 clinics were used in the final analysis. Most clinics always used the state's immunization information system to record HPV vaccinations (89.4%). Over a quarter of clinics (27.6%) did not use any type of reminder or recall system to alert parents or providers that an HPV vaccine was due, and 35.0% did not give the vaccine at sick visits. CONCLUSIONS: Clinics need to focus more on the recommended logistics and processes to ensure that patients receive the entire HPV vaccination series. Survey results indicate that clinics are not consistently implementing the recommended best practices to ensure that vaccination series are completed.",0
1225,"In the face of unmet basic needs, low SES adults are less likely to obtain needed preventive health services. The study objective was to understand how these hardships may cluster and how the effectiveness of different health-focused interventions might vary across vulnerable population sub-groups with different basic needs profiles. From June 2010-2012, a random sample of low-income adult callers to Missouri 2-1-1 completed a cancer risk assessment and received up to 3 health referrals for needed services (mammography, pap testing, colonoscopy, HPV vaccination, smoking cessation and smoke-free home policies). Participants received either a verbal referral only (N=365), verbal referral+tailored print reminder (N=372), or verbal referral+navigator (N=353). Participants reported their unmet basic needs at baseline and contacts with health referrals at 1-month post-intervention. We examined latent classes of unmet basic needs using SAS. Logistic regression examined the association between latent classes and contacting a health referral, by intervention condition. A 3 class solution best fit the data. For participants with relatively more unmet needs (C2) and those with money needs (C3), the navigator intervention was more effective than the tailored or verbal referral only conditions in leading to health referrals contacts. For participants with fewer unmet basic needs (C1), the tailored intervention was as effective as the navigator intervention. The distribution and nature of unmet basic needs in this sample of low-income adults was heterogeneous, and those with the greatest needs benefitted most from a more intensive navigator intervention in helping them seek needed preventive health services.",0
1226,"Vaccination strategies for adults have recently been updated to include newer vaccine products and to reflect the changing epidemiology of vaccine-preventable diseases in adults. New products include vaccines against shingles and the human papillomavirus, and a combination vaccine which contains an acellular pertussis component (Tdap). In some cases, existing vaccines have been re-formulated to provide alternate routes of delivery, as is the case with the influenza vaccine, or more effective formulations, as is the case with the meningococcal vaccine. Vaccine strategies for adults are designed to respond to existing, emerging, or re-emerging infectious diseases in populations at risk. This includes the resurgence of pertussis and recent evidence showing that diabetics are at increased risk for hepatitis B. Unfortunately, large portions of the adult population do not receive recommended vaccinations. As a result, more adults die from vaccine-preventable diseases than die from motor vehicle accidents. Strategies to improve vaccine coverage include public education campaigns and making some vaccines available in nontraditional settings such as retail stores or workplaces. Within health care settings, successful strategies have included the use of standing orders, automatic reminders for physicians using the electronic health record and recall/reminder letters for patients. Appropriate use of adult vaccines plays a key role in prevention of disease and the provision of high-quality care.",0
1227,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is genetically complex with multifactorial etiology. Here, we aim to identify the potential viral pathogens leading to aberrant inflammatory and oxidative stress response in AD along with potential drug candidates using systems biology approach. We retrieved protein interactions of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau protein (MAPT) from NCBI and genes for oxidative stress from NetAge, for inflammation from NetAge and InnateDB databases. Genes implicated in aging were retrieved from GenAge database and two GEO expression datasets. These genes were individually used to create protein-protein interaction network using STRING database (score≥0.7). The interactions of candidate genes with known viruses were mapped using virhostnet v2.0 database. Drug molecules targeting candidate genes were retrieved using the Drug- Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb). Data mining resulted in 2095 APP, 116 MAPT, 214 oxidative stress, 1269 inflammatory genes. After STRING PPIN analysis, 404 APP, 109 MAPT, 204 oxidative stress and 1014 inflammation related high confidence proteins were identified. The overlap among all datasets yielded eight common markers (AKT1, GSK3B, APP, APOE, EGFR, PIN1, CASP8 and SNCA). These genes showed association with hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein- Barr virus (EBV), human herpes virus 8 and Human papillomavirus (HPV). Further, screening of drugs targeting candidate genes, and possessing anti-inflammatory property, antiviral activity along with a suggested role in AD pathophysiology yielded 12 potential drug candidates.

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents/guardians of 11-17 year old female adolescents and their pediatric primary care providers in one inner-city public clinic and three private practices to ascertain why girls who initiated HPV vaccination did or did not complete the series. Qualitative analysis was used to identify perceived barriers and facilitators of completion. RESULTS: 65 parents/guardians participated: 37 whose daughters received 1 or 2 HPV vaccine doses and 28 whose daughters completed the series. 89% (n = 33) of parents who did not complete the series intended to do so, but were not reminded by the clinic or encountered logistical barriers. Four (11%) decided to stop the vaccine series. 33 providers participated: 24 physicians, 3 nurse practitioners, and 6 registered nurses. Half (n = 14, 52%) of the providers said they told parents when the next doses were due but relied on parents to schedule appointments, 11 (41%) scheduled the second dose when the first dose was given, and 2 (7%) tried to immunize patients when they returned for other appointments. None of the four practices had a reminder/recall system in place to ensure series completion. Of note, neither parents nor providers stated that the need for three doses was a barrier to series completion. CONCLUSIONS: Most failure to complete the HPV vaccine series occurred because providers expected parents to make appointments while parents expected to be reminded. Increased use of reminder/recall systems and team-based care with clear communication of expectations regarding appointment scheduling could increase completion rates.",0
1229,"The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that adolescents routinely receive 1 dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, 2 doses of meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine, and 3 doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.* ACIP also recommends administration of ""catch-up""† vaccinations, such as measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), hepatitis B, and varicella, and, for all persons aged ≥6 months, an annual influenza vaccination. ACIP recommends administration of all age-appropriate vaccines during a single visit. To assess vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years, CDC analyzed data from the 2013 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen).§ This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which show that from 2012 to 2013, coverage increased for each of the vaccines routinely recommended for adolescents: from 84.6% to 86.0% for ≥1 Tdap dose; from 74.0% to 77.8% for ≥1 MenACWY dose; from 53.8% to 57.3% for ≥1 HPV dose among females, and from 20.8% to 34.6% for ≥1 HPV dose among males. Coverage varied by state and local jurisdictions and by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) region. Healthy People 2020 vaccination targets for adolescents aged 13-15 years were reached in 42 states for ≥1 Tdap dose, 18 for ≥1 MenACWY dose, and 11 for ≥2 varicella doses. No state met the target for ≥3 HPV doses.¶ Use of patient reminder and recall systems, immunization information systems, coverage assessment and feedback to clinicians, clinician reminders, standing orders, and other interventions can help make use of every health care visit to ensure that adolescents are fully protected from vaccine-preventable infections and cancers (5), especially when such interventions are coupled with clinicians' vaccination recommendations.",0
1230,"Since 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has expanded the routine adolescent vaccination schedule with administration of the following vaccines at ages 11 or 12 years: meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY), 2 doses; tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap), 1 dose; human papillomavirus (HPV), 3 doses; and influenza, 1 dose annually. To assess vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years, CDC analyzed data from the National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen). This report summarizes the results of that assessment, which indicated that, from 2010 to 2011, vaccination coverage increased for ≥1 dose Tdap on or after age 10 years (from 68.7% to 78.2%), ≥1 dose MenACWY (from 62.7% to 70.5%), and, among females, for ≥1 dose of HPV (from 48.7% to 53.0%) and ≥3 doses of HPV (from 32.0 to 34.8%). Vaccination coverage varied widely among states. Interventions that increase adolescent vaccination coverage include strong recommendations from health-care providers, urging consideration of every health visit as an opportunity for vaccination, reducing out-of-pocket costs, and using reminder/recall systems. Despite increasing adolescent vaccination coverage, the percentage point increase in ≥1 dose HPV coverage among adolescent females was less than half that of the increase in ≥1 dose of Tdap or MenACWY. The causes of lower coverage with HPV vaccine are multifactorial; addressing missed opportunities for vaccination, as well as continued evaluation of vaccination-promoting initiatives, is needed to protect adolescents against HPV-related cancers.",0
1231,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women worldwide, with more than 85% of cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Human papillomavirus (HPV) screening allows for self-collection with the potential to increase coverage, but still requires triage to identify which HPV+ women need diagnostic and treatment procedures. However, achieving high levels of triage adherence can be challenging, especially among socially vulnerable women. This paper describes the ATICA protocol (Application of Communication and Information Technologies to Self-Collection, for its initials in Spanish), aimed at evaluating the implementation strategy and the effectiveness of a multi-component mobile health (mHealth) intervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests. METHODS: We will use an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial with a mixed-methods evaluation approach. A cluster randomized trial design including 200 community health workers (CHWs) will evaluate whether the mHealth intervention increases adherence to triage among HPV+ women who self-collected at home during a CHW visit within 120 days after a positive result. The intervention includes an initial mobile phone text message (SMS) alert and subsequent reminders sent to HPV+ women. For those who do not adhere to triage within 60 days of a positive HPV test, an email and SMS will be sent to the CHWs to promote contact with these women during home visits. We will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as an organizing and analytic framework to evaluate the implementation of the intervention while also drawing on Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM). We will conduct a self-administered, semi-structured survey of CHWs, semi-structured interviews with local health authorities, and a survey of HPV+ women. Combining both qualitative and quantitative data will provide rich insights into local implementation challenges and successes. DISCUSSION: Findings from the implementation evaluation will be applicable to programs that use or are planning to incorporate HPV self-collection and/or mHealth interventions in different settings and countries. This innovative study will also serve as a model for using implementation science in the region. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03478397 . Registered on 20 March 2018.",0
1232,"OBJECTIVE: To describe knowledge about human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV vaccination among women ages 19 to 26 seeking a variety of services at reproductive health centers. A secondary objective was to identify common sources of HPV information. METHODS: Ten reproductive health centers enrolled 365 women ages 19 to 26 in a randomized, controlled trial to determine the effect of automated reminder messages on HPV vaccine completion. Using responses from a 61-item self-administered baseline questionnaire completed before initiating the HPV vaccine, this subanalysis assessed participants' knowledge regarding HPV and the HPV vaccine. RESULTS: Knowledge of HPV prevention, transmission, and disease outcomes among the study population was highly variable. The mean HPV knowledge score was 11.0 of a possible 19 (SD = 3.8). Most participants (77%) had heard of the HPV vaccine before completing the questionnaire and indicated that their primary sources of information about the vaccine were television ads (61%), health care providers (52%), and friends (45%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relatively high awareness of the vaccine, specific knowledge regarding HPV and the HPV vaccine varied substantially and participant scores highlighted knowledge gaps among vaccine-eligible young women. Media, health care providers, and friends were identified by participants as sources of information and may influence their knowledge of HPV and the HPV vaccine.",0
1233,"BACKGROUND: Like young people in other developed countries, sexually active young Australians can have an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmissible infections (STIs). This paper reviews intervention programs that aim to reduce the incidence and transmission of HIV and STIs among young people in Australia. METHODS: Articles were identified from seven databases. Intervention studies conducted in Australia that included young people aged 12-25 years were reviewed. A two-dimensional matrix consisting of 'setting' and 'intervention type' was developed to categorize each study. RESULTS: Forty-two studies met the inclusion criteria, and the majority were uncontrolled intervention studies. Of these, 23/42 studies measured participation in chlamydia +/- other STI testing and found that the highest participation rates took place in non-clinical and non-general practice health care settings. Four studies facilitated access to testing indirectly, through the internet or other media. Ten studies involved the provision of education and measured its impact on factors such as knowledge, attitudes and/or behaviour. Three studies involved novel immunisation strategies for either hepatitis B or human papillomavirus vaccines. Two studies evaluated the impact of enhanced STI surveillance programs on prevalence rates. CONCLUSIONS: Proactive STI testing in non-clinical and some health settings appears feasible and achieves higher testing rates than in general practice; however, more evaluation of testing strategies in general practice settings is required. New technologies such as the internet and SMS are useful adjuncts for influencing behaviours such as condom use and STI testing. Media campaigns that promote STI testing can have a positive impact on testing rates.",0
1234,"This study tested the feasibility of promoting 1-800-4-CANCER through partnerships with organizations serving African American and Hispanic communities. Small-media and client reminders about human papillomavirus vaccination were made available through local agents to 28 community organizations. Organizations ordered 79 932 resources and distributed them to young women and parents of girls-;African Americans in St Louis, Missouri, and Hispanics in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Pre- to postintervention calls to 1-800-4-CANCER increased 38% in these communities, while declining 15% in comparison communities of Kansas City, Missouri, and El Paso, Texas (F = 8.6, P = .004) and 1.4% in the United States as a whole.",0
1235,"Purpose We evaluated the feasibility of a multilevel intervention to increase the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine initiation among adolescents. Methods We used a four-arm factorial, quasi-experimental trial to assess feasibility and short-term, preliminary effectiveness of a health system-level, gender-specific postcard campaign and an in-clinic health information technology (HIT) system. Between August and November 2013, we tested the intervention among 11- to 17-year-olds without prior HPV vaccine claims in the Florida Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program encounters (2,773 girls and 3,350 boys) who attended or were assigned to primary care clinics in North Central Florida. Results At least one postcard was deliverable to 95% of the parents. Most parents (91% boys' and 80% girls') who participated in the process evaluation survey (n = 162) reported seeking additional information about the vaccine after receiving the postcard. Only 8% (57 of 1,062) of the adolescents assigned to a HIT provider with an office visit during the study used the HIT system. When compared with arms not containing that component, HPV vaccine initiation increased with the postcard campaign (girls, odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1–2.3 and boys, not significant), the HIT system (girls, OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.0–2.3 and boys, OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.0–2.0), and the combined HIT and postcard intervention (girls, OR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.4–4.3 and boys, OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.0–2.5). Conclusions A system-level postcard campaign was feasible. Despite low recruitment to the in-clinic HIT system, the intervention demonstrated short-term, preliminary effectiveness similar to prior HPV vaccine interventions.",0
1236,"Cervical cancer is a preventable disease. Precancers can be identified and treated through cervical screenings. The HPV vaccine prevents precancers from becoming cancers. The aim of the A Su Salud Cervical Cancer Prevention Program was to apply well-understood health promotion techniques and increase the rate of cervical cancer screening among a high-risk, multiethnic, low-income population in South Texas. Qualitative research was used to identify uptake barriers and tailor media messaging. Using existing resources, we applied evidence-based strategies in novel ways that changed personal behaviors, leading to cancer screening, risk reduction, and early detection. We created a database to track a cohort of 32,807 women and measured cervical cancer screenings over 3 years. Our analysis revealed an increase in cervical cancer screenings after use of highly targeted automated telephone reminders and media dissemination on multiple platforms. Those women at low risk for cervical cancer obtained the highest proportion of Pap tests. This innovative, theory-based program increased overall Pap tests up to 9% among women enrolled in a safety net hospital financial assistance plan. This study fills a gap in research on Pap test compliance in uninsured, mostly Hispanic women by building on cultural strengths and tailored messaging.",0
1237,"Although the HPV vaccine has been shown to be highly effective in preventing cervical dysplasia, vaccination rates remain low. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an electronic medical record (EMR) prompt on HPV vaccination rates in the postpartum setting. We conducted a pre-post intervention study among postpartum women ages 18-26 seen at an outpatient clinic from 09/01/2012-08/31/2013 (pre-intervention) and from 10/01/2013-03/31/2014 (post-intervention). The intervention was a drop-down menu that was inserted into the EMR postpartum note template inquiring about the patient's HPV vaccination status and whether or not the vaccine was administered at that visit. HPV vaccination uptake was compared pre and post-intervention. Of the 278 postpartum visits during the study period, 241 were eligible for analysis. There was a significant increase of the HPV vaccine uptake, from 1.2 % (2/173) among pre-intervention visits to 26.5 % (18/68) among post-intervention visits (p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, ethnicity, insurance, and religion, HPV vaccination was significantly higher at postpartum visits during the intervention period, with an adjusted OR = 93.49 [95 % CI 15.29-571.52]. Among visits in which the vaccine was not given, HPV vaccination was not discussed in 46 % and patients refused the vaccine in 40 % of visits. An EMR prompt in the postpartum note could be an effective way to promote HPV vaccination in the postpartum setting. It will likely take a combination of strategies to optimize vaccination uptake.",0
1238,"OBJECTIVE: To identify characteristics associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates, describe barriers and facilitators to vaccine uptake and the potential role for clinician-to-clinician Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange (AFIX) visits in school-based health centers (SBHCs). Methods: We conducted clinician-to-clinician AFIX visits at 24 New York City (NYC) high-school and middle-school SBHCs with up-to-date adolescent vaccination rates below 40%. Using NYC's immunization information system, we assessed HPV initiation and series completion rates at the time of AFIX visit and follow-up three to five months later. We analyzed responses to a questionnaire and summarized interviews to identify barriers and facilitators to HPV immunization practices and quality improvement (QI) implementation. Results: Baseline initiation and completion rates were 76% and 43% for high schools, and 81% and 45% for middle schools. SBHCs that allowed adolescent self-consent or did not require separate vaccine consent had higher baseline rates, but was not statistically significant. Barriers to series completion included challenges with scheduling and appointment compliance. At follow-up, high school SBHCs increased HPV vaccine initiation by 2.9 percentage points (p < 0.01) and series completion by 2.7 percentage points (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant increase at middle school SBHCs. Most SBHCs (88%) chose reminder/recall systems as a QI strategy. Fewer than half (42%) implemented their QI strategy. Conclusions: We identified barriers to HPV vaccine series completion at our sample of SBHCs. Clinician-to-clinician AFIX visits may help improve vaccination rates and encourage providers to address barriers, including streamlining consent processes for HPV vaccination.

1239,"High attendance is essential to cervical cancer screening results. Attendance in the Finnish program is currently at 70%, but extensive opportunistic screening occurs beside the organized. A shift from opportunistic to organized screening is imperative to optimize the costs and impact of screening and minimize potential harms. We evaluated the effect of reminder letters (1st reminder) and self-sampling test (2nd reminder) on program attendance. The study population consisted of 31,053 screening invitees in 31 Finnish municipalities. 8,284 non-attendees after one invitation received a reminder letter and 4,536 further non-attendees were offered a self-sampling option. Socioeconomic factors related to participation were clarified by combining screening data to data from Statistics Finland. Reminder letters increased participation from 72.6% (95% CI 72.1, 73.1) to 79.2% (95% CI 78.8, 79.7) and self-sampling further to 82.2% (95% CI 81.8, 82.7). Reminder letters with scheduled appointments resulted in higher increase than open invitations (10 vs. 6%). Screening of original non-attendees increased the yield of CIN3+ lesions by 24%. Non-attendance was associated with young age, immigrant background, lower education level and having never been married. We showed that a total attendance of well over 80% can be achieved within an organized program when the invitational protocol is carefully arranged.",0
1240,"With all the new vaccines and strategies for prevention, the most important challenge that one continues to talk about globally and at home is the one presented by ongoing transmission of diseases for which excellent vaccines already exist. As pediatricians, this presents a constant reminder to keep the conversation about the importance of vaccine-preventable diseases with the patients and their families going at every possible opportunity possible. One needs to constantly remind oneself that every case of a vaccine-preventable disease is a missed opportunity for prevention. One must also have a broader perspective for global eradication of vaccine-preventable disease and advocate for availability of vaccines globally at affordable cost and encourage local vaccine development.",0
1241,"OBJECTIVE: We conducted a descriptive study of the correlates of refusal and acceptance of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination by rural parents of preadolescent and adolescent children. We hypothesized that the correlates of parents who allow their children aged 9 to 13 years to get the HPV vaccine and those of parents who do not allow vaccination would differ significantly. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was implemented during the school years 2009-2011 in the elementary and middle schools of three rural counties in Georgia. Parents were recruited at school functions to complete an anonymous validated survey. RESULTS: Parents who chose to vaccinate their children or intended to vaccinate were twice as likely to be from a race other than African American and 2.7 times more likely to have a religion other than Baptist. Using stepwise logistic regression and after adjustment for race and religion, we found that parents who had vaccinated or intended to vaccinate had significantly higher scores on perceived barriers (1.02 times more likely to vaccinate) and lower scores on perceived benefits (1.01 times more likely to vaccinate) (model p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that healthcare providers in rural areas can increase HPV vaccine uptake and reduce HPV-related cancers by using a multifaceted approach to educating their patients within the context of the patients' cultural values, geographic location, and economic situation. Such an approach could dispel misinformation and increase vaccine uptake.",0
1242,"This exploratory descriptive study examined perceived vulnerabilities to human papillomavirus (HPV) and the correlation to factors influencing vaccine beliefs and vaccine decision making in young Hispanic males attending a large public urban university. Only 24% of participants believed that the HPV vaccine could prevent future problems, and 53% said they would not be vaccinated. The best predictors of HPV vaccination in young Hispanic men were agreement with doctor recommendations and belief in the vaccine's efficacy. Machismo cultural norms influence young Hispanic men's HPV-related decision making, their perceptions of the vaccine, and how they attitudinally act on what little HPV information they have access to. This study provides culturally relevant information for the development of targeted health education strategies aimed at increasing HPV vaccination in young Hispanic men.",0
1243,"An exploratory pilot descriptive research study was conducted in the rural counties of Hendry and Glades Florida exploring parental knowledge and hesitancy of HPV vaccination. Participants included parents/caregivers with children ages 9 to 13; using quantitative methods, we evaluated knowledge, feelings, and beliefs toward HPV vaccination including vaccination prevalence and correlates among participating parents/caregivers. Our measures included the Parental HPV Survey with a Cronbach's alpha of .96. Hesitancy-focused results revealed 26% of parents showed caution because of stigma around vaccination while attributing low levels of knowledge about HPV vaccination; 80% had a persistent belief HPV vaccination could leave their child sterile, perpetuating hesitancy. Participants with a high-school education or less (64%) and conservative religious affiliation, e.g., Baptist and Catholic (74%), did not decline HPV vaccination. Results are striking considering research indicating conservative religious views and lack of a college education leads to lower HPV vaccination rates. Numerous interventions to increase HPV vaccination have been studied including strong recommendations for increased provider communication but our data indicates increasing public education with community input and a focus on cultural norms in each specific rural community among parents and providers is needed to increase HPV vaccine knowledge and decrease HPV vaccine hesitancy.",0
1244,"There is currently no national cervical screening or HPV immunization program in Vietnam. This study aims to synthesize available data on the burden of disease and to project the burden of cervical cancer to 2049 if no major interventions are implemented. We reviewed published data sources on risk factors for HPV prevalence, high-grade lesions, cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Vietnam from 1990 to 2017. We then used the available data to project the number of new cervical cancer cases for the period 2013-2049. Data on cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Vietnam are limited; two Vietnamese cancer registries have been reported on by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which cover urban populations representing ∼20% of the national population. The reported age-standardized cervical cancer incidence in Hanoi was 6.7 (1993-1997), compared to 28.8 and 14.1 per 100,000 women in Ho Chi Minh City (1995-1998 and 2009-2012, respectively). Cancer mortality data are not uniformly available from cancer registries or mortality surveys in Vietnam because cause of death has not been routinely ascertained. Based on available urban population registry data, estimated rates in the rural population, and forward projection of existing trends, we estimate that without any further intervention, the number of new cases will increase from 6930 (range 5671-8493) in 2012 to 8562 (range 5775-12,762) in 2049, giving a total of 379,617 (range 276,879-542,941) new cases over the period 2013-2049. These findings help underpin the case for the delivery of HPV vaccination and cervical screening in Vietnam, and support similar initiatives in other low- and middle-income countries.",0
1245,"OBJECTIVE: To learn more about human papilloma virus (HPV) knowledge and vaccination among teens and young women age 13 to 26 years from an economically disadvantaged, urban community. Our aim was to identify common beliefs about HPV vaccine initiation and describe the relationship between attitudes, norms, perceived control, and intention to receive HPV vaccine, drawing from the theory of planned behavior (TPB). DESIGN: Mixed method, descriptive design. Guided by the TPB, HPV vaccine beliefs were assessed through focus groups. Intention to receive the vaccine, demographic and clinical factors, and theoretical predictor variables (attitudes, norms, and control) were assessed through questionnaires. SETTING: After recruitment, focus groups were held at a convenient date and time for our participants in a small university conference room. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were economically disadvantaged young women, age 13 to 26 (N = 34). METHODS: Specific behavioral, normative, and control beliefs were elicited in focus groups and analyzed using content analysis. Simple and multivariate general linear modeling with adjustment for prognostic demographic and clinical factors was completed to assess the influence of the theoretical predictor variables on the outcome of HPV vaccine initiation. RESULTS: Influential beliefs toward vaccination were identified. Analysis indicated attitudes, norms, and perceived control toward HPV vaccine initiation were highly significant predictors of intent, as was tobacco use; all p's < .001. CONCLUSION: Barriers to HPV vaccine initiation were identified, and strong preliminary evidence supports use of the TPB to guide programs to promote urban, economically disadvantaged young women's intent to begin the HPV vaccine.",0
1246,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers in West Africa. Even though vaccines that protect against the most common Human papillomavirus (HPV) strains, 16 and 18, are currently in use in developed countries, the implementation of these vaccines in developing countries has been painfully slow, considering the pre-eminence of HPV-associated cervical cancer among women in those countries. AIM: We performed serological and PCR-based assessment of blood and tissue specimens obtained from women undergoing cervical cancer-related surgery at a major urban hospital in Bamako. Since several therapeutic HPV vaccines are currently in clinical trials, we also assessed willingness to participate in HPV cancer vaccine trials. METHODS: Blood and biopsy samples of 240 women were evaluated for HPV types 16 and 18 by serology and PCR. Knowledge regarding the HPV vaccine and autonomy to decide to vaccinate their own child was assessed with a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: HPV 16 and 18 were identified in 137/166 (82.5%) cervical cancer biopsy samples by PCR. Co-infection with both HPV 16 and 18 was significantly more frequent in women over 50 years of age than in younger women (63.0% vs. 37.0%). 44% of study participants said they would be willing to vaccinate their child with HPV vaccine. Only 39% of women participating in this study reported that they would be able to make an autonomous decision to receive HPV vaccination. Permission from a male spouse or head of household was identified as important for participation by 59% of the women. CONCLUSION: This study provides strong support for the introduction of currently available HPV vaccines in Mali, and also provides key information about conditions for obtaining informed consent for HPV vaccine trials and HPV vaccination in Mali.",0
1247,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women and the leading cause of cancer deaths in women in Côte d'Ivoire. Low resource countries can now prevent this cancer by using HPV vaccine and effective and affordable screening tests. However the implementation of these prevention strategies needs well-trained human resources. Part of the solution could come from midwives by integrating cervical cancer prevention into reproductive health services. The aim of this survey was to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices of midwives towards cervical cancer prevention in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, and to find out factors associated with appropriate knowledge. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among midwives in the urban district of Abidjan, using a self-administered questionnaire. Knowledge was assessed by two scores. Factors associated with appropriate knowledge were determined using a logistic regression analysis. Attitudes and practices were described and compare using the Chi2 test. RESULTS: A total of 592 midwives were enrolled, including 24.5% of final-year students. 55.7% of midwives had appropriate knowledge on cervical cancer, and 42.4% of them had appropriate knowledge on cervical cancer prevention strategies. Conferences, courses taken at school of midwifery and special training sessions on cervical cancer (OR = 4.9, 95% CI [1.9 to 12.6], p <0.01) were associated with good knowledge on the management of this disease. Among these midwives, 18.4% had already benefited from a screening test for themselves, 37.7% had already advised screening to patients and 8.4% were able to perform a visual inspection. 50.3% of midwives knew HPV vaccine as a preventive method; among them 70.8% usually recommended it to young girls. CONCLUSION: Despite sufficient knowledge about cervical cancer prevention, attitudes and practices of midwives should be improved by organizing capacity building activities. This would ensure the success of integration of cervical cancer prevention into reproductive health services in countries like Côte d'Ivoire.",0
1248,"BACKGROUND: Malnutrition substantially impacts the health outcomes of children. Globally, the childhood prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased, while underweight and stunting (though decreasing) continues to pose a major public health challenge. In low- to middle-income countries, a mixed pattern of over- and undernutrition (nutritional transition) can exist in communities. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of malnutrition among female learners in the Nongoma and Ceza districts in Zululand, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of anthropometric data collected during the 2011 HPV Vaccination Demonstration Project. School health teams, comprising trained nurses, measured the height (in cm) and weight (in kg) of 963 female learners in 31 primary schools. Internationally accepted standardised measures were used as cut-offs for defining overweight, obesity, underweight and stunting. RESULTS: We found evidence of both under- and overnutrition. Overall, 9% of female learners were overweight, 3.8% obese, 4% underweight and 9.2% stunted (using WHO/NCHS criteria). The highest levels of stunting were in the 11 - 12-year age groups, of underweight in the 10-year age group, of overweight and obesity in the 9 - 10-year age groups. Moreover, a proportion of underweight (17.4%), overweight (11.1%) and obese (22.9%) learners were also stunted. CONCLUSION: Our study describes the prevalence of overweight and obesity, wasting and stunting of female learners in KZN and suggests the presence of a nutritional transition in these rural communities; however, further studies are needed. Our findings emphasise the need for health promotion and education programs in schools.",0
1249,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide a population-based estimate of human papillomavirus (HPV) seropositivity for women in a rural African context and to evaluate the impact of HPV serostatus on subsequent acquisition of HIV outside a clinical setting. DESIGN: A random sample of women participating in a longitudinal, population-based HIV survey combined with a case-control study. METHODS: Blood samples of women participating in a single round of population-based HIV surveillance (N = 1049) in a rural South African population were used to measure vaccine-preventable HPV seropositivity (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) in the general population in 2010. Using results from the repeat HIV surveys, a case-control analysis was then performed comparing HPV sero-status in samples taken from HIV sero-converting women (prior to infection with HIV) against samples from HIV-uninfected, sexually-active controls matched 1:1 according to 5-year age band (377:377). Unconditional multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputations was used to control for sociodemographic and behavioral variables associated with HIV acquisition. RESULTS: Human papillomavirus seropositivity in the population-based sample of women was 20.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.3-23.4), and HIV prevalence was 27.6% (95% CI, 24.9-30.4). In the case-control analysis, allowing for variables known to be associated with HIV incidence, HPV seropositivity was associated with nearly 2.5 times the odds of subsequent acquisition of HIV (adjusted odds ratio, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.61-3.39]; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HPV vaccination before or soon after sexual debut could lower HIV infection risk. Randomized trials that quantify the impact of HPV vaccination in girls on the risk of acquiring HIV are urgently required.",0
1250,"BACKGROUND: In this study, we used data from the National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) to examine HPV vaccination uptake by rural and urban residence defined by ZIP code. METHODS: We used 2012-2013 NIS-Teen data to examine associations of HPV vaccination among teens aged 13-17 years with ZIP code measures of rural/urban (Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes, population density). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of HPV vaccination initiation (≥ 1 dose) and completion (≥ 3 doses). RESULTS: HPV vaccination was lower among girls from isolated small rural towns (≥1 dose 51.0%; ≥3 doses 30.0%) and small rural towns (≥1 dose 50.2%; ≥3 doses 26.8%) than among urban girls (≥1 dose 56.0%; ≥3 doses 35.9%). Girls from small rural towns had lower odds of completion (0.74, 95% CI: 0.60-0.91) than girls from urban areas. HPV vaccination was lower among boys from isolated small rural towns (≥1 dose 17.3%; ≥3 doses 5.31%) and small rural towns (≥1 dose 18.7%; ≥3 doses 5.50%) than those in urban areas (≥1 dose 28.7%; ≥3 doses 10.7%). Boys in isolated small rural towns had statistically significantly lower odds of initiation (0.68, 95% CI: 0.52-0.88) and completion (0.63, 95% CI: 0.41-0.97) than urban boys. Girls and boys from high-poverty rural areas had lower odds of initiation and completion than did their counterparts from high-poverty urban areas. CONCLUSION: Rural girls had lower odds of completing the HPV vaccine than their urban counterparts. Rural boys had lower odds than urban boys for HPV vaccination initiation and completion.",0
1251,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate adolescent vaccination in New York City, we assessed tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate (MCV4), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake, vaccine co-administration, and catch-up coverage over time. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Citywide Immunization Registry, a population-based immunization information system, to measure vaccine uptake and co-administration, defined as a Tdap vaccination visit where MCV4 or HPV vaccine was co-administered, among 11-year-olds. Catch-up vaccinations were evaluated through 2013 for adolescents born 1996 to 2000, by birth cohort. HPV vaccination among boys included data from 2010 to 2013. RESULTS: Adolescent vaccine administration was greatest during the back-to-school months of August to October and was highest for Tdap. Although MCV4 uptake improved over the study years, HPV vaccine uptake among girls stagnated; boys achieved similar uptake of HPV vaccine by 2012. By 2013, 65.4% had MCV4 co-administered with Tdap vaccine, whereas 28.4% of girls and 25.9% of boys had their first dose of HPV vaccine co-administered. By age 17, Tdap and MCV4 vaccination coverage increased to 97.5% and 92.8%, respectively, whereas ≥1-dose and 3-dose HPV vaccination coverage were, respectively, 77.5% and 53.1% for girls and 49.3% and 21.6% for boys. Age-specific vaccination coverage increased with each successive birth cohort (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: From 2007 to 2013, there were greater improvements in Tdap and MCV4 vaccination than HPV vaccination, for which co-administration with Tdap vaccine and coverage through adolescence remained lower. Parent and provider outreach efforts should promote timely HPV vaccination for all adolescents and vaccine co-administration.",0
1252,"AIM: Achieving high human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine coverage is important because cervical screening coverage is declining. As key decision makers, mothers' experiences of, and participation in, the cervical screening programme could affect vaccination consent. We investigate whether mother's screening history influences daughter's participation in the HPV vaccination programme. METHODS: Mothers' cervical screening records from the National Health Authority Information System were linked to the daughters' HPV vaccination records from the Child Health System in North West England by address. Odds ratios for daughter's vaccination were computed using Logistic Regression, adjusting for age, Primary Care Trust and vaccine cohort (AOR). RESULTS: Daughters in both the routine and catch up programmes were more likely to have initiated vaccination and completed the course if their mothers had attended screening. The association was strongest when mothers had attended within the last 5 years (AOR in routine group: 3.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1-4.0) for initiation and 2.2 (1.6-2.9) for retention). Mothers who had personally decided to cease screening were less likely to have vaccinated daughters than those who had ceased for medical indications. Daughters were more likely to have been vaccinated if their mothers had received an abnormal smear result. CONCLUSIONS: Daughter's HPV vaccination uptake was associated with mother's cervical screening attendance. Daughters of mothers who are not engaged with preventive services are less likely to be vaccinated and may be less likely to engage with screening. This makes mothers central to health interventions to promote both cervical screening and HPV vaccination.",0
1253,"BACKGROUND: Achieving high human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine coverage may reduce inequalities in cervical cancer prevention by mitigating the inequalities seen in the cervical screening programme. This paper assesses whether the same sociodemographic factors are associated with both cervical screening and HPV vaccination. METHODS: Girls' HPV vaccination records were linked by address to cervical screening records for their mothers in the North West of England. Index of Multiple Deprivation scores (2010) and census ethnicity data (2001) were used to investigate the association between deprivation and ethnic composition of area of residence with HPV vaccination and cervical screening uptake, along with potential differences between Primary Care Trusts (PCTs), which were responsible for vaccine delivery. RESULTS: Deprivation was not associated with routine (12-13-year-olds) vaccination initiation, but girls living in the most deprived quintile were significantly less likely to complete the three vaccine doses (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88). Mother-daughter pairs failing to engage in either screening or vaccination were also more likely to live in deprived areas (routine vaccination OR for most deprived quintile: 2.35; 95% CI 2.00 to 2.77). There were differences between PCTs after controlling for demographic effects (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.52). CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring completion of the vaccine schedule is critical for organisations responsible for vaccine delivery in order to reduce cancer risk among girls living in deprived areas. There remains a small minority of mothers and daughters from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not participate in either cervical screening or HPV vaccination.",0
1254,"BACKGROUND: Coverage of the UK National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme is declining. Under-screened women whose daughters participate in the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme could be stimulated to attend. We investigated whether factors associated with the vaccination programme changed mothers' intentions for future screening. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to mothers of girls aged 12-13 years across two North West primary care trusts (n=2387) to assess the effect of the HPV vaccination programme on screening intentions. This identified mothers whose intentions had changed. Consent was sought to contact them for a semi-structured interview to discuss their screening intentions. Key themes were identified using framework analysis. RESULTS: 97/606 women responding to the questionnaire had changed their views about cervical screening. 23 women were interviewed, 10 of whom expressed a positive change and 13 no change. Most had discussed the vaccine information, including cervical screening, with their daughters. Mothers who made a positive change decision recognised their daughters' risk of cervical cancer, the need for future screening, and the importance of their own example. In this way daughters became 'significant others' in reinforcing their mothers' cervical screening motivation. CONCLUSIONS: A daughter's invitation for HPV vaccination instigates a reassessment of cervical screening intention in some under-screened mothers.",0
1255,"Background: Cervical cancer (CC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths among Indonesian women. Pilot prevention programs, including human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for young adolescent girls, and cervical screening for women, have been implemented. However, many communities are yet to receive these interventions, nor targeted education regarding CC prevention. This study explored community readiness and acceptance of HPV vaccination and CC screening, as well as knowledge and perceptions of HPV and CC, to determine facilitators and barriers to upscaling CC prevention in rural Central Java. Methods: Qualitative data collection in October 2015 consisted of four focus group discussions with married women and men, and 22 semi-structured interviews with married women. All 57 participants, 39 women and 15 men, lived in Purworejo Regency in rural Central Java. Results: Most participants had no knowledge of HPV or the causal link between HPV and CC. However, most participants were supportive of vaccinating their children against HPV. Most participants had heard of cervical cancer, although understandings of symptoms and causes were very poor. Less than half of the women interviewed had undergone CC screening. Multiple barriers to screening were reported, including: a dislike of pelvic exams; embarrassment at being screened by a male doctor; anxiety over the cost; fearing a positive result; and being asymptomatic and thus not perceiving the need for screening. Conclusions: Extensive community education about HPV and CC, targeting women and men, adolescents, health workers and teachers, is crucial to support the introduction of the HPV Demonstration Program and the upscaling of CC screening. Low incomes among rural families underline the need for the HPV vaccine to be provided free within the National Immunization Program, and for CC screening to be free at primary health clinics.",0
1256,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was (1) to explore for socio-demographic factors that could potentially affect the intention of women to vaccinate themselves, their 13-year-old daughter and their 13-year-old son against HPV, and (2) to investigate the main reasons for declining vaccination. METHODS: A structured questionnaire was used in participants of the project (N = 5,249). Logistic regression analysis was applied in order to examine the correlation between vaccine acceptability and a list of potential predictors. In women declining vaccination, the reported reasons for decline were analyzed. RESULTS: Residence in rural areas and low to medium tiers of family income were the most constant factors in favor of intention to vaccinate. Receiving information from a healthcare professional was found to positively affect vaccine acceptability for the woman herself, but it did not affect her intention to vaccinate her daughter or her son. The acceptance rates decreased significantly after the vaccine became available, both for the women themselves and for their daughters or sons. During the same year, a shift was noted in the reason for declining vaccination; the self-perception of insufficient knowledge significantly decreased and the fear of adverse effects significantly increased in all three cases. CONCLUSION: Apart from demographic factors which may favor or disfavor vaccine acceptability, the intention to vaccinate decreased significantly and the proportion of women rejecting vaccination for safety concerns increased significantly after the introduction of the vaccine, coinciding with isolated cases of negative publicity and highlighting the potential of misinformation by the media.",0
1257,"Objective: Estimating the incidence and mortality rate of cervical cancer became necessary to establish prevention measures and healthy policies. The aim of this study was to estimate the updated incidence and mortality rate of cervical cancer in 2013 in China. Methods: According to the evaluation criteria developed by the National Central Cancer Registry of China, the data submitted from 255 cancer registries met the required standards in 2013. Cervical cancer cases were retrieved from the national database and combined with the 2013 national population data. The age-standardized incidence and mortality rates were based on the demographic structure of the national census 2000 and Segi's world population. Results: In 2013, the estimated number of new cases and deaths from cervical cancer were 100,700 and 26,400, respectively. The crude incidence of cervical cancer was 15.17/100,000. The age-standardized incidence rates based on the Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and the world standard population (ASIRW) were 11.30/100,000 and 10.30/100,000, respectively. The incidence of cervical cancer in urban areas was 15.62/100,000 and the ASIRC was 11.12/100,000. The incidence of cervical cancer in rural areas was 14.65/100,000 and the ASIRC was 11.47/100,000. The mortality rate of cervical cancer was 3.98/100,000. The age-standardized mortality rates based on the Chinese (ASMRC) and world standard populations (ASMRW) were 2.76/100,000 and 2.62/100,000, respectively. The mortality rate of cervical cancer in urban areas was 3.85/100,000 and in rural areas was 4.14/100,000. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality increased with age. Urban areas had a higher incidence of cervical cancer and lower mortality rates when compared with rural areas. Conclusions: Dynamic monitoring of cervical cancer incidence and mortality is the fundamental work of cervical cancer prevention and control. Cervical cancer is a serious issue in women's health, and prevention strategies need to be enhanced, such as human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination and screening programs.",0
1258,"OBJECTIVE: The goal was to explore the association of being underinsured and receiving doses at a health department clinic (HDC) with not receiving all recommended adolescent vaccine doses. METHODS: A total of 5657 adolescents, 13 to 17 years of age, were sampled in the National Immunization Survey-Teen in 2006-2007. RESULTS: A total of 63.9% of all adolescents were covered by private health insurance. Among privately insured adolescents, approximately 31.3% were underinsured. Compared with fully insured adolescents, underinsured adolescents were more likely to receive doses at an HDC for tetanus-diphtheria toxoids/tetanus toxoids-reduced diphtheria toxoids-acellular pertussis vaccine (25.1% vs 6.2%; P < .05), tetravalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (11.5% vs 2.5%; P < .05), and quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (16.2% vs 3.4%; P < .05). Also, compared with fully insured adolescents, underinsured adolescents who received doses at an HDC had lower estimated rates of vaccination coverage for tetanus-diphtheria toxoids/tetanus toxoids-reduced diphtheria toxoids-acellular pertussis vaccine (58.5% vs 70.9%; P < .05), tetravalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (10.8% vs 25.8%; P < .05), and quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (7.8% vs 14.3%; P < .05). CONCLUSION: Underinsured adolescents who receive doses at an HDC have lower rates of vaccination coverage than do fully insured adolescents.",0
1259,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the baseline information about the knowledge of cervical cancer and explore attitude and practice of Pap smear screening among staff nurses. METHODS: A pretested structured self administered questionnaire based survey was done on 205 staff nurses working in Rural Institute of Medical Sciences & Research, Saifai, Etawah, containing mostly recognition and some recall type questions about demographics, knowledge about cervical cancer, its risk factors, screening techniques, attitudes towards cervical cancer screening and its practices. RESULTS: In this study, 74% knew that Pap smear is used for detection of cervical cancer, but only 59% knew that it can detect both cancerous as well as precancerous lesions of the cervix. Only 18% of the respondents knew about human papillomavirus vaccine. A 47% of respondents had never taken a Pap smear; 63% never referred patients for the screening. Most nurses (79%) thought that a speculum examination and Pap smear are procedures to be performed by the doctors. Among all the respondents, only 11% had ever undergone a Pap smear on themselves. CONCLUSION: Despite knowledge of the gravity of cervical cancer and prevention by screening, attitudes and practices towards screening were negative.",0
1260,"Policy Points: Policymakers in the United States should consider expanding pharmacy practice laws to allow pharmacists to vaccinate adolescents as a way to improve geographic access to adolescent vaccines, particularly for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which has low uptake. Our state-level analysis showed that pharmacists are more geographically dispersed than primary care physicians in the US state of Texas. Including pharmacists among available adolescent vaccine providers would improve the geographic distribution of vaccine providers, especially in areas with an inadequate number of primary care physicians. CONTEXT: The largest disparities in human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in the United States are due to geography. One potential way of addressing these disparities is by improving geographic access to HPV vaccination. Two federal panels have recommended including community pharmacists as HPV vaccine providers as a strategy to improve opportunities for HPV vaccination for adolescents. We sought to evaluate whether community pharmacists can improve the number of vaccine providers in areas with primary care physician shortages in the US state of Texas. METHODS: We gathered publicly available physician and pharmacist 2016 workforce data from the Texas Medical Board and Board of Pharmacy. We conducted geospatial analysis of census tracts to analyze the distribution of physicians and pharmacists and how pharmacists change vaccine provider coverage across the state. FINDINGS: Census tracts with high numbers of physicians per capita tended to be located near one another, in 5 of 5 analyses of Moran's I (median = .04). In contrast, pharmacist rates were not spatially dependent on census tract in any of our analyses. If pharmacists were added to primary care physicians as vaccine providers, 35% of urban census tracts that previously had inadequate coverage would be adequately covered, while 18% of inadequately covered rural census tracts would become adequately covered. Overall, when pharmacists were included with primary care physicians as vaccine providers, vaccine providers per capita increased in 2,413 of the 4,508 urban census tracts (54%), while the rate increased in 223 of 746 rural census tracts (30%). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists are more geographically dispersed across census tracts than primary care physicians. As a result, adding pharmacists to the workforce would increase the availability of vaccine providers in areas with inadequate primary care provider coverage.",0
1261,"BACKGROUND: Considering the limited cross protection offered by the current HPV vaccines, understanding the HPV genotype distribution among the different population is essential in predicting the efficacy of current vaccine and devising new vaccine strategy. The present work aimed at investigating the HPV genotypes distribution among women with and without cervical carcinoma in Odisha, Eastern India. METHODS: A total of 607 participants have been enrolled between January 2014 and June 2016. L1-PCR, sequencing, and E6/E7 nested multiplex type- specific PCR were performed for HPV detection and genotyping. Cytological distribution of 440 cases includes invasive cervical carcinoma or ICC (n = 210), inflammatory smear (n = 162), normal cytology (n = 68). Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS version 20.0 software and MediCal version 14.10.2(7). A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HPV infection was (359/595) 60.33%. Prevalence of HPV infection was 93.80% (197/210) in invasive cervical cancer (ICC) cases, 54.32% (88/162) in inflammatory smear and 19.11% (13/68) in normal cervical cytology. The most prevalent genotype was HPV16 (87.28%) followed by HPV18 (24.56%) and HPV 51(3.46%). The overall prevalence of single type was 76.58% and highest (78.9%) among ICC cases. The most frequent genotype combination after HPV16 + 18(9.4%) was HPV16 + 66 + 68(2.7%) which was frequently observed in inflammatory cytology. Age > 45years, parity ≥3, low socio-economic condition, rural residential area and post menopause state were significantly associated with HPV infection. Multiple infections did not have a significant association with any of the clinicopathological variables (stage, LN metastasis, cell type) except tumor size ≥ 2cm in ICC cases. The impact of 2v, 4v, and 9v vaccines in preventing cervical cancer in Odisha were 89.99, 91.65, and 92.16% respectively. CONCLUSION: This data would help planning an appropriate strategy for disease monitoring and provides baseline data for post-vaccination surveillance in the region. The nonavalent vaccine would be significant in preventing cervical carcinoma in Odisha. Hence an effective vaccination program based on regional HPV epidemiological profile along with the cervical cancer screening is necessary to reduce the cervical cancer burden in India.",0
1262,"BACKGROUND: High-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) cause cervical cancer. American Indian (AI) women in the Northern Plains of the U.S. have significantly higher incidence and mortality rates for cervical cancer than White women in the same geographical area. We compared HPV prevalence, patterns of HPV types, and infection with multiple HPV types in AI and White women living in South Dakota, U.S. METHODS: We analyzed the HPV status of cervical samples collected in 2006-2008 from women aged 18-65 years who attended two rural AI reservation clinics (n = 235) or an urban clinic in the same area serving mostly White women (n = 246). Data collection occurred before HPV vaccination was available to study participants. HPV DNA was amplified by using the L1 consensus primer system and an HPV Linear Array detection assay to identify HPV types. We used chi-square tests to compare HPV variables, with percentages standardized by age and lifetime number of sexual partners. RESULTS: Compared to White women, AI women were younger (p = 0.01) and reported more sexual partners (p < 0.001). A lower percentage of AI women tested negative for HPV infection compared to Whites (58% [95% CI = 51-65] vs. 77% [95% CI = 71-82]; p < 0.001), and a higher percentage of AI women were infected by oncogenic types (30% [95% CI = 25-36] vs. 16% [95% CI = 11-21]; p = 0.001). Infections among AI women showed a wider variety and very different pattern of HPV types, including a higher prevalence of mixed HPV infections (19% [95% CI = 26-38] vs. 7% [95% CI = 4-11]; p = 0.001). AI women had a higher percentage of HPV infections that were not preventable by HPV vaccination (32% [95% CI = 26-38] vs. 15% [95% CI = 11-21]; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A higher HPV burden and a different HPV genotyping profile may contribute to the high rate of cervical cancer among AI women.",0
1263,"BACKGROUND: Despite the benefit of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in preventing cervical cancer, fewer than half of eligible young women in the United States have initiated the three-vaccine series. Among those who initiate HPV vaccination, large proportions do not complete the three-dose regimen. PURPOSE: To evaluate racial and health insurance-related disparities in HPV vaccination. METHODS: We analyzed outpatient claims data for 8069 patients, ages 9-26 years, who had gynecologic visits at the University of Maryland Medical Center outpatient clinic from August 2006 to January 2010. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of our sample initiated the vaccine series, including 91% of those ages 9-13. Only 11% of the sample and 33% of the 9-13 age group completed the 3 dose series. A higher proportion of blacks than whites (38% vs. 32%; p<0.01) initiated, and 11% and 12%, respectively, of each race completed. Lower age was strongly correlated with uptake. After adjustment for insurance, blacks were less than half as likely as whites to complete the series in all age groups, and had 0.35 the odds (95% CI 0.26-0.46) of adherence. The uninsured had much lower race-adjusted odds than insured groups for initiation, but had similar adherence rates. Publicly insured individuals were more likely than the privately insured to complete all 3 doses. CONCLUSIONS: Of the population of gynecologic service seekers seen at our university-based outpatient practice clinics, a significant minority initiate but do not complete the HPV vaccine series. More blacks than whites initiate the series, but similar proportions of the two races complete. Lack of insurance appears to be a major barrier to initiation, despite free vaccination programs.",0
1264,"BACKGROUND: Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in the United States is slow, and the effectiveness of the vaccine has not been assessed in high-risk adolescent populations. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study of 1139 sexually active, inner-city adolescent women receiving the 3-dose quadrivalent (4vHPV) vaccine. Cervical and anal specimens collected semiannually were tested using an L1-specific polymerase chain reaction assay. Postvaccination incidence of 4vHPV vaccine and nonvaccine HPV types, and risk of cervical cytological abnormalities, were assessed in relation to time to completion of all 3 vaccine doses. RESULTS: Compared to vaccine naive women at enrollment, vaccinated women had significantly lower incidence rate ratios of cervical infection with HPV6/11/16/18 (0.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], .1-.4) and the related types HPV31 and HPV45 (0.4 [95% CI, .2-1.0] and 0.3 [95% CI, .1-.6], respectively), as well as significantly lower incidence rate ratios of anal infection with HPV6/11/16/18 (0.4; 95% CI, .2-.7). Notably, we observed higher risks of cervical HPV6/11/16/18 infection (hazards ratio [HR], 2.9; 95% CI, 1.0-8.0) and associated cytological abnormalities (HR, 4.5; 95% CI, .7-26.0) among women immunized at ≥15 years of age who took ≥12 months (vs <12 months) to complete the 3-dose regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Among adolescents immunized at ≥15 years of age, a longer time to complete the 3-dose schedule was associated with an increased risk of anogenital HPV6/11/16/18 infection and an increased incidence of associated cervical cytological abnormalities.",0
1265,"BACKGROUND: An increase in worldwide HPV vaccination could be facilitated if fewer than three doses of vaccine are as effective as three doses. We originally aimed to compare the immunogenicity and frequency of persistent infection and cervical precancerous lesions caused by vaccine-targeted HPV after vaccination with two doses of quadrivalent vaccine on days 1 and 180 or later, with three doses on days 1, 60, and 180 or later, in a cluster-randomised trial. Suspension of the recruitment and vaccination due to events unrelated to our study meant that some enrolled girls could not be vaccinated and some vaccinated girls received fewer than the planned number of vaccinations by default. As a result, we re-analysed our data as an observational cohort study. METHODS: Our study was designed to be done in nine locations (188 clusters) in India. Participants were unmarried girls aged 10-18 years vaccinated in four cohorts: girls who received three doses of vaccine on days 1, 60, and 180 or later, two doses on days 1 and 180 or later, two doses on days 1 and 60 by default, and one dose by default. The primary outcomes were immunogenicity in terms of L1 genotype-specific binding antibody titres, neutralising antibody titres, and antibody avidity after vaccination for the vaccine-targeted HPV types 16, 18, 6, and 11 and incident and persistent infections with these HPVs. Analysis was per actual number of vaccine doses received. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN98283094; and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00923702. FINDINGS: Vaccination of eligible girls was initiated on Sept 1, 2009, and continued until April 8, 2010. Of 21 258 eligible girls identified at 188 clusters, 17 729 girls were recruited from 178 clusters before suspension. 4348 (25%) girls received three doses, 4979 (28%) received two doses on days 1 and 180 or later, 3452 (19%) received two doses at days 1 and 60, and 4950 (28%) received one dose. Immune response in the two-dose HPV vaccine group was non-inferior to the three-dose group (median fluorescence intensity ratio for HPV 16 1·12 [95% CI 1·02-1·23] and for HPV 18 1·04 [0·92-1·19]) at 7 months, but was inferior in the two-dose default (0·33 [0·29-0·38] for HPV 16 and 0·51 [0·43-0·59] for HPV 18) and one-dose default (0·09 [0·08-0·11] for HPV 16 and 0·12 [0·10-0·14] for HPV 18) groups at 18 months. The geometric mean avidity indices after fewer than three doses by design or default were non-inferior to those after three doses of vaccine. Fewer than three doses by design and default induced detectable concentrations of neutralising antibodies to all four vaccine-targeted HPV types, but at much lower concentration after one dose. Cervical samples from 2649 participants were tested and the frequency of incident HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11 infections was similar irrespective of the number of vaccine doses received. The testing of at least two samples from 838 participants showed that there was no persistent HPV 16 or 18 infections in any study group at a median follow-up of 4·7 years (IQR 4·2-5·1). INTERPRETATION: Despite the limitations imposed by the suspension of the HPV vaccination, our findings lend support to the WHO recommendation of two doses, at least 6 months apart, for routine vaccination of young girls. The short-term protection afforded by one dose of HPV vaccine against persistent infection with HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11 is similar to that afforded by two or three doses of vaccine and merits further assessment.

1266,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a major strategy for preventing cervical and other ano-genital cancers. Worldwide HPV vaccination introduction and coverage will be facilitated if a single dose of vaccine is as effective as two or three doses or demonstrates significant protective effect compared to 'no vaccination'. METHODS: In a multi-centre cluster randomized trial of two vs three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccination (Gardasil™) in India, suspension of the vaccination due to events unrelated to the study led to per protocol and partial vaccination of unmarried 10-18 year old girls leading to four study groups, two by design and two by default. They were followed up for the primary outcomes of immunogenicity in terms of L1 genotype-specific binding antibody titres, neutralising antibody titres, and antibody avidity for the vaccine-targeted HPV types and HPV infections. Analysis was per actual number of vaccine doses received. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN98283094; and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00923702. FINDINGS: Of the 17,729 vaccinated girls, 4348 (25%) received three doses on days 1, 60, 180 or later, 4979 (28%) received two doses on days 1 and 180 or later, 3452 (19%) received two doses on days 1 and 60, and 4950 (28%) received one dose. One dose recipients demonstrated a robust and sustained immune response against HPV 16 and 18, albeit inferior to that of 3- or 2-doses and the antibody levels were stable over a 4 year period. The frequencies of cumulative incident and persistent HPV 16 and 18 infections up to 7 years of follow-up were similar and uniformly low in all the vaccinated study groups; the frequency of HPV 16 and 18 infections were significantly higher in unvaccinated age-matched control women than among vaccine recipients. The frequency of vaccine non-targeted HPV types was similar in the vaccinated groups but higher in the unvaccinated control women. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a single dose of quadrivalent HPV vaccine is immunogenic and provides lasting protection against HPV 16 and 18 infections similar to the three- and two-dose vaccine schedules, although the study suffer from some limitations. Data on long term protection beyond 7 years against HPV infection and cervical precancerous lesions are needed before policy guidelines regarding a single dose can be formulated and implemented. Significant and long-lasting protective effect of a single dose can be a strong argument to introduce one dose of the HPV vaccine in many low income countries where the current standard of care for cervical cancer prevention is 'no intervention'.",0
1267,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge on human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype distribution in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is essential to assess the impact of HPV vaccine. It is provided information for Colombia. METHODS: In all, 189 RRP primary cases diagnosed between 1985 and 2009 were identified from 5 pathology laboratories of Cali and Medellin, Colombia. HPV DNA testing in 129 cases that fulfilled inclusion criteria (available paraffin blocks, amplifiable DNA, and confirmed histologic diagnosis of RRP) was performed by the SPF-10/LiPA25 assay (version 1). RESULTS: Of all cases 36.1% were juvenile (<12 years old) and a majority of adults were males (p = .09); 95% of cases were HPV positive. HPV 6, 11, and 16 contributed to 69%, 27.1%, and 7.8% of all HPV positive cases. Twelve cases (9.3%) showed multiple infections; 8 of these were HPV 6 or 11 positive. CONCLUSIONS: HPV prophylactic vaccine including HPV 6 and 11 may have a major impact against RRP.",0
1268,"Introduction: In most developed countries, incidence of cervical cancer declined likely due to well-established cervical cancer screening programs. However, such decline has not been identified in Eastern Europe, where such programs are not well established.Methods: This study utilized data of the Bulgarian Cancer Registry for the period 1993-2013. Age-standardized incidence and mortality trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression. Maps were created to illustrate spatial distributions of rates.Results: The northern region of Bulgaria showed a larger cervical cancer burden than the southern region and rural women tended to be diagnosed at older ages (p<0.0001) and later stages (p<0.0001) than urban women. The distribution of disease stages changed over the 21 years, with most common stages of diagnosis being stage II in 1993 (39.2%) to stage I in 2013 (44.7%; p<0.0001). While age-standardized mortality slightly increased over the 21 years (from 4.8 to 5.2 per 100,000; p=0.009), age-standardized incidence increased from 14.0 to 21.4 per 100,000 up until 2006 (p<0.001), after which it plateaued.Conclusions: The lack of a similar plateau in mortality may be because the second most prevalent stage of diagnosis in recent years was stage III, indicating diagnosis at advanced symptomatic stages. Cervical cancer incidence is expected to continue to decrease if screening programs are strengthened and human papillomavirus vaccines are widely utilized. As Bulgaria has shared cervical cancer trends with other Eastern European countries in the past, it may be beneficial to develop future prevention interventions based on a regional, rather than a country-specific level.",0
1269,"School nurses are at the intersection of the healthcare and school communities, thus, they can be considered opinion leaders in providing health advice – including information about the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine – to parents and students. This study examined school nurses’ attitudes toward the HPV vaccine based on age, years as a school nurse, geographic location, urban vs. rural work setting, HPV and vaccine knowledge, perception of role as opinion leaders, and school district support in providing health education. Participants (n = 413) were systematically sampled from the National Association of School Nurses’ membership and completed a web-based survey. Multiple regression was used to predict positive HPV vaccine attitudes. The model was statistically significant accounting for 50.8% of the variance (F[9, 400] = 45.96,p < .001). Positive attitudes regarding the HPV vaccine were predicted by higher HPV and vaccine knowledge (β = .096,p < .001) and stronger perceptions of role as opinion leaders for the vaccine (β = .665,p < .001). No other variables were found to be statistically significant. These results suggest knowledge is essential in predicting positive attitudes, but not the strongest predictor as perceptions of role as opinion leaders was more crucial in terms of predicting school nurses’ positive attitudes towards HPV vaccine. Despite school nurses being seen as champions for adolescent vaccines, they need additional professional development to increase their HPV vaccine knowledge and attitudes to encourage parents and adolescents to consider the uptake of HPV vaccination. To engage school nurses’ in promoting HPV vaccine uptake, interventions need to focus on increasing school nurses’ perception of their role as opinion leaders for HPV vaccine and knowledge to increase positive attitudes towards HPV vaccination for youth.",0
1270,"BACKGROUND: Oral Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is rare in the general population but common in high-risk individuals. Recent data indicate that oral HPV is associated with the development of head and neck carcinomas. HPV16 infection, in particular, increases the risk of oropharyngeal cancer. METHODS: We evaluated oral HPV prevalence and determinants of infection in cancer-free HIV-infected and uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM) recruited among attendees of an STI/HIV centre. Oral rinse and gargles were collected using a mouthwash and analyzed with the Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test. Socio-demographic and behavioral data were collected through face-to-face interviews. RESULTS: Overall, 170 MSM participated: 98 HIV-uninfected and 72 HIV-infected (91.7% under cART). Oral HPV was detected in 17.3% and 27.8% of the subjects, respectively (p = 0.13). Non-carcinogenic HPVs were significantly more common among HIV-infected MSM (18.1% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.01). Prevalence of the HPV types included in the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was similar (6.1% vs. 8.3% for the HIV-negative and positive MSM, respectively, p = 0.76). HPV16 was the most frequent type in HIV-negative (5.1%), and HIV-positive individuals, in the latter group together with HPV18, 72 and 84 (4.2% each). Older age at first sex (AOR: 4.02, 95% CI: 1.17-13.86 for those older than 18 years of age at first intercourse, p = 0.027) and a higher lifetime number of receptive oral sex partners (AOR: 9.14, 95% CI: 2.49-33.62 for those with >50 compared to ≤50 partners, p<0.001) were determinants of oral HPV among HIV-infected MSM. CONCLUSION: Oral HPV infection among MSM attending an urban STI center is very frequent compared to the general population. Sexual behavior appears to be the major determinant of infection among the HIV-infected individuals.",0
1271,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to (1) assess the accuracy of parental recall of adolescent (11-17 years) daughters' HPV vaccine initiation in a low-income, urban Hispanic population, and (2) describe the correlates of accurate recall. METHODS: We compared parental recall of HPV vaccine naivety to daughter's electronic medical records to calculate the proportion of parents accurately reporting HPV naïve status. We used mixed effects logistic regression to identify correlates of accurate recall. RESULTS: We verified vaccination status for 1103 daughters of participants who reported their daughters were HPV vaccine-naïve; 69.3% of parents accurately reported their daughters as HPV vaccine-naïve. Parents of older daughters (13-17 years) compared to younger daughters (11-12 years) had significantly lower odds of accurately reporting daughters as unvaccinated (AOR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.42-0.83). DISCUSSION: Underreporting of vaccination status among our study population corresponds with national data that suggest lower income and minority populations underreport HPV vaccination initiation and completion.",0
1272,"Though many studies have documented correlates of HPV vaccine acceptability, our study is one of the first to examine correlates of vaccine initiation. The current study aimed to identify modifiable correlates of HPV vaccine initiation among adolescent girls in high risk communities and whether correlates varied by race and urban/rural status. In 2007, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 889 parents of adolescent girls aged 10-18 living in areas of North Carolina, USA with high cervical cancer rates. We analyzed data using logistic regression. Health Belief Model constructs were associated with HPV vaccine initiation in multivariate analyses, including doctor's recommendation to get HPV vaccine, perceived barriers to obtaining HPV vaccine, and perceived potential vaccine harms. While exploratory stratified analyses suggested that many of the same parent beliefs were important correlates of HPV vaccine initiation regardless of racial group or urban/rural status, a few differences did exist. These potentially modifiable beliefs offer well-defined targets for future interventions designed to increase HPV vaccine coverage. However, the beliefs' relative importance may differ between racial groups and regions.",0
1273,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer incidence in the United States may be greatly reduced through widespread human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. We estimated the statewide level of HPV vaccine initiation among adolescent girls in North Carolina and identified correlates of vaccine initiation. METHODS: We used data from 617 parents of adolescent females from North Carolina who completed the population-based 2008 Child Health Assessment and Monitoring Program survey. Analyses used weighted multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 31.3% of parents reported their daughters had received at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine. Vaccine initiation was higher among daughters aged 13 to 15 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.03, 95% CI, 1.12-3.67) or 16 to 17 years (OR = 3.21, 95% CI, 1.76-5.86) compared with those 10 to 12 years old. Additional correlates of HPV vaccine initiation included the daughter having a preventive check-up in the last 12 months (OR = 5.09, 95% CI, 2.43-10.67), having received meningococcal vaccine (OR = 2.50, 95% CI, 1.55-4.01), or being from an urban area (OR = 1.81, 95% CI, 1.02-3.21). Among parents of unvaccinated daughters, intent to vaccinate in the next year was higher among those with daughters aged 13 to 17 years. Parents of unvaccinated non-Hispanic white daughters reported lower levels of intent to vaccinate within the next year compared with parents of unvaccinated daughters of other races. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccine initiation in North Carolina is comparable with other US areas. Potential strategies for increasing HPV vaccination levels include reducing missed opportunities for HPV vaccination at preventive check-ups and increasing concomitant administration of HPV vaccine with other adolescent vaccines.",0
1274,"OBJECTIVES: If approved for use in young males in the United States, prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine may reduce the incidence of HPV-related disease in vaccinated males and their sexual partners. We aimed to characterise heterosexual men's willingness to get HPV vaccine and identify correlates of vaccine acceptability. METHODS: Participants were from a national sample of heterosexual men (n=297) aged 18-59 y from the United States who were interviewed in January 2009. We analysed data using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Most men had not heard of HPV prior to the study or had low HPV knowledge (81%; 239/296). Most men had heard of HPV vaccine prior to the study (63%; 186/296) and 37% (109/296) were willing to get HPV vaccine. Men were more willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher perceived likelihood of getting HPV-related disease (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.17), perceived HPV vaccine effectiveness (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.83) or anticipated regret if they did not get vaccinated and an HPV infection later developed (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.89). Acceptability was also higher among men who thought (OR 9.02, 95% CI 3.45 to 23.60) or who were unsure (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.30 to 5.47) if their doctor would recommend they get HPV vaccine if licensed for males. CONCLUSIONS: Men had low HPV knowledge and were moderately willing to get HPV vaccine. These findings underscore the need for HPV educational efforts for men and provide insight into some of the factors that may affect the HPV vaccination decision making process among men.",0
1275,"BACKGROUND: In Nicaragua, cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death for women ages 15-44, yet access to the HPV vaccine is limited to those with financial resources to pay for it. Cervical cytology is provided free of charge in public clinics; however, only 10% of women receive Pap smears at the nationally recommended frequency. Previous studies have not investigated how beliefs regarding cervical cancer screening may differ for urban and rural populations in Nicaragua. Furthermore, no investigation has assessed Nicaraguan women's beliefs about a potential HPV immunization campaign. Given beliefs' influence on health behavior, we investigated the structural, sociocultural, and knowledge-based factors influencing women's beliefs regarding cervical cancer screening among urban and rural women in León, Nicaragua, and assessed acceptance of a potential HPV immunization program. METHODS: Our sequential explanatory mixed-methods study consisted of two phases: (1) a close-ended questionnaire, followed by (2) a qualitative, in-depth interview. Our quantitative sample contained 117 urban and 112 rural participants aged 18-49. We assessed beliefs regarding cervical cancer screening using a 22-item scale, with higher scores indicating screening-promoting beliefs in simple linear and multiple linear regressions. Twenty qualitative interviews, exploring the sociocultural dimensions of knowledge and attitudes indicated by our quantitative findings, were conducted with a sample of 13 urban and 7 rural women aged 19-46. RESULTS: The multiple linear regression indicates that greater knowledge of Pap smears, HPV, and cervical cancer is significantly associated with screening-promoting beliefs after adjusting for other relevant factors. There was no significant difference in screening knowledge and beliefs for urban and rural women. Four recurrent themes representing determinants of knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes regarding cervical cancer screening arose from interviews and built on quantitative findings: (1) women's embarrassment due to the intimate nature of the Pap smear and male gender of exam provider discourages screening; (2) women believe Pap smears and cervical cancer are associated with sexual promiscuity, and this association stigmatizes women with the disease; (3) knowledge of cervical cancer prevention is limited to those who regularly attend health centers; and (4) women find screening inconvenient, believing understaffed clinics increase patient wait time, limit time patients spend with clinicians, and delay Pap results. A fifth theme indicates (5) participants' acceptance of a potential HPV immunization program. DISCUSSION: Future interventions should focus on increasing access to information about cervical cancer prevention for women who do not regularly attend health centers. Furthermore, our results suggest that if funding were allocated to make the HPV vaccine accessible in Nicaragua, it would be well received.",0
1276,"OBJECTIVE: To describe attitudes and perceptions toward acceptability of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination among inner city Caribbean (CA) and African American (AA) adolescents and their parents, and discuss correlates that may be associated with these factors. DESIGN: Questionnaire survey. SETTING: An adolescent medicine clinic. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample was recruited of 175 adolescent girls aged 13 to 19 years and 74 parents attending adolescent clinic. INTERVENTION: Participants completed an anonymous confidential 10-minute questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on knowledge about HPV, cervical cancer (CC), attitudes and acceptance of the HPV vaccine. RESULTS: Responses of 175 adolescent girls and 74 parents were analyzed. Overall, 48.9% of the teens were sexually active (SA) and had a 2.2-fold greater odds (OR = 2.21; 95% CI = 1.13-4.36) of being interested in HPV vaccination versus girls who were not SA. While only 55.8% of girls knew what HPV is, this knowledge was significantly associated with knowing that most CC is caused by HPV (P < 0.001) and with interest in receiving HPV vaccination (P < 0.001). Less than half (44.5%) of adolescent girls were interested in receiving the HPV vaccine and only 37.5% of parents. There were no significant influences in parental acceptance of the vaccine with regard to age, ethnicity and educational level, insurance, and living situation.The majority of parents wanted the vaccine for its role in preventing CC. CONCLUSIONS: Although controversy surrounds HPV vaccine in regard to its supposed role in promoting SA, only a minority of our parents showed concern for that association. The level of acceptance of the HPV vaccine was overall lower than what has been reported among other racial/ethnic populations. Knowledge about HPV and its association with CC were significantly associated with interest in getting the HPV vaccine and both parents and teens seem to accept the HPV vaccine more for its role in CC prevention.",0
1277,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is common among women worldwide. A multitude of risk factors aggravate the disease. This study was conducted to: (1) determine the prevalence and (2) make a comparative analysis of the socio-demographic and behavioural risk factors of cervical cancer and knowledge, attitude and practice between rural and urban women of North Bengal, India. STUDY DESIGN: Community-based cross-sectional study. METHODS: A survey (first in North Bengal) was conducted among 133 women in a rural area (Kawakhali) and 88 women in an urban slum (Shaktigarh) using predesigned semi-structured questionnaires. The respondents were informed of the causes (including HPV), signs and symptoms, prevention of cervical cancer and treatment, and the procedure of the PAP test and HPV vaccination. RESULTS: The prevalence of risk factors like multiparity, early age of marriage, use of cloth during menstruation, use of condom and OCP, early age of first intercourse was 37.2%, 82%, 83.3%, 5.4%, 15.8% and 65.6% respectively. Awareness about the cause, signs and symptoms, prevention of cervical cancer, PAP test and HPV vaccination was 3.6%, 6.3%, 3.6%, 9.5% and 14.5% respectively. Chi-square testing revealed that in the study population, significant differential at 5% exists between rural and urban residents with respect to number of children, use of cloth/sanitary napkins, family history of cancer and awareness regarding causes of cervical cancer. Regarding KAP, again using chi-square tests, surprisingly, level of education is found to be significant for each element of KAP in urban areas in contrast to complete absence of association between education and elements of KAP in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of risk factors were present in both areas, the prevalence being higher in the rural areas. The level of awareness and role of education appears to be insignificant determinants in rural compared to urban areas. This pilot study needs to be followed up by large scale programmes to re-orient awareness campaigns, especially in rural areas.",0
1278,"AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the level of awareness and knowledge of HPV infection and vaccination among 1,000 adolescent girls from secondary schools and colleges in five metro cities of India-Ahmedabad, Cuttack, Lucknow, Gwalior, and Visakhapatnam. To evaluate participants own interest and barriers toward HPV vaccination for cervical cancer prevention. MATERIALS: This cross-sectional study was conducted by Adolescent Health Committee of FOGSI from April 2009 to March 2010 under the project ""protecting young girls."" Girls of 13-19 years, with an average of 16 years are targeted. METHODS: A written questionnaire with two parts has been applied. A preliminary written questionnaire included questions of knowledge on cancer cervix and HPV awareness. Then, health talk on HPV is given by the researcher and group discussions lasting for 20 min. Second questionnaire was then applied to evaluate effectiveness of the talk. RESULTS: The study group participants are poorly aware about HPV infection and vaccination but are intensely willing to know about it and get vaccinated. 72 % of them did not know about cervical cancer or HPV. 77.2 % were not aware of the virus that causes cancer cervix. After the health talks. there is an overall significant positive improvement in both knowledge and awareness. 74.4 % of them agreed to get vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: This study brings out the unawareness about HPV infection and vaccination in urban adolescent girls in five metro cities in India. Results show a changing positive trend of acceptance toward HPV vaccination. Adolescent understanding of HPV is needed to have successful vaccination programs in India.",0
1279,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted viral infection. HPV can cause cervical cancer and other cancers of the genitals, neck and throat. Two HPV vaccines are available, Cervarix and Gardasil, which are the first vaccines directed at the prevention of cervical cancer. The purpose of the study was to assess the knowledge of human papilloma virus and HPV vaccine among rural women in Vhembe district in Limpopo Province. A quantitative descriptive approach was adopted. The quantitative design enabled the discovery of more information by means of direct questioning of a sample of women 30years and older. A convenience sampling was used to select 1546 respondents. Data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. The findings revealed that (97.8%) of women lacked knowledge about Human Papilloma Virus and HPV vaccine and were also not aware of the transmission methods of HPV virus. Furthermore (94.3%) were not aware who was eligible for HPV vaccine and the age range for vaccination and (92.1%) displayed negative attitudes to the use of vaccines if given a pamphlet to let their daughters be immunized. The awareness on human papilloma virus and HPV vaccine among women in Vhembe district is limited. There is a need to educate and promote awareness on cervical cancer screening methods among women to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality.",0
1280,"Purpose: To make baseline comparisons and evaluate the efficacy of an intervention designed to improve human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV vaccine awareness, knowledge, and attitudes among ethnically diverse participants. Methods:Design: Pre- and post-intervention surveys. Setting: An urban, Hispanic-Serving South Florida university. Subjects: Three hundred eighty-seven diverse college students attending a gender studies course. Intervention: Students received a brief educational message designed to improve HPV-related knowledge and attitudes. Baseline and follow-up survey data were collected. Measures: Outcome measures included baseline and follow-up awareness of HPV, perceived knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccination, measured knowledge score, vaccine attitudes, and doses of HPV vaccine received. Analysis: Chi-square, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare baseline differences and evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. Results: Hispanic participants had more positive attitudes toward HPV vaccination (62% vs. 44%, p=0.009) and were more willing to become vaccinated (66% vs. 46%, p=0.02) than non-Hispanic participants at baseline. Hispanic women (48%) were more likely to have initiated HPV vaccination than Hispanic men (27%, p=0.006). At baseline, only 30% of participants scored ≥4/7 points in knowledge. Participants' HPV knowledge improved by 41% after the intervention, with no difference by ethnicity in the post-intervention score. Conclusion: The intervention was useful in improving HPV-related knowledge and attitudes among diverse college students. Future studies should examine barriers to vaccination among ethnic minorities.",0
1281,"Purpose:                      We assessed differences in receipt of cervical cancer screening and completion of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series between sexual minority and non sexual minority women by using two sub-constructs of sexual orientation-gender of sexual partners and anatomy of sexual partners.                          Methods:                      We employed a serial cross-sectional design by using medical record data from August 2012 through August 2016 from an urban health center to compare receipt of cervical cancer screening and completion of the HPV vaccine series. In Wave 1 of the study, gender of sexual partners was the construct used. In Wave 2 of the study, anatomy of sexual partners was the construct used. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the odds of being up-to-date on cervical cancer screening and completion of the HPV vaccine series among sexual minority women compared with non sexual minority women, with n = 729 in Wave 1 and n = 740 in Wave 2 of the study.                          Results:                      Sexual minority women in Wave 2 were significantly less likely to be up-to-date on cervical cancer screening than non sexual minority women (odds ratio = 0.457, p = 0.012, 95% confidence interval 0.248-0.843). We did not find a statistically significant association between receipt of cervical cancer screening and sexual minority status in Wave 1. No significant association between sexual minority status and completion of the HPV vaccine series was found in either Wave.                          Conclusion:                      This study provides important information for clinicians and researchers regarding a disparity in cervical cancer screening practices among sexual minority women, utilizing a novel approach for identifying these women.",0
1282,"OBJECTIVE: To examine facilitators and barriers to HPV vaccine uptake in African-American, Haitian, Latina, and White women aged 18-22 and to determine vaccination completion rates among participants over 5 years. DESIGN: Using semi-structured interviews and medical record review, we assessed HPV knowledge and attitudes towards HPV vaccination among young women. We then determined their subsequent HPV vaccination initiation and completion rates. We used constructs from the Health Belief Model and methods based in grounded theory and content analysis to identify attitudes towards HPV vaccination cues to initiate vaccination, perception of HPV, and how communication about issues of sexuality may impact vaccine uptake. PARTICIPANTS: We enrolled 132 African-American, Haitian, Latina, and White women aged 18-22 years who visited an urban academic medical center and 2 affiliated community health centers between the years 2007 and 2012. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intent to vaccinate and actual vaccination rates. RESULTS: Of 132 participants, 116 (90%) stated that they were somewhat or very likely to accept HPV vaccination if offered by their physician, but only 51% initiated the vaccination over the next 5 years. Seventy-eight percent of those who initiated vaccination completed the 3 doses of the HPV vaccine series. Forty-five percent (45%, n = 50) of the adolescents who started the series completed 3 doses over a 5-year period: 42% of African-American (n = 16), 33% of Haitian (n = 13), 63% of Latina (n = 10), and 65% of White young women (n = 11) completed the 3-dose series. Despite low knowledge, they reported high levels of trust in physicians and were willing to vaccinate if recommended by their physicians. CONCLUSION: Desire for HPV vaccination is high among older adolescents, physician recommendation, and use of every clinic visit opportunity may improve vaccine uptake in young women. More White young women completed the HPV vaccine series compared with other race and ethnic young women.",0
1283,"PURPOSE: To examine the attitudes toward human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among young men from African American, Haitian, Caucasian, and Latino backgrounds. METHODS: We used in-person surveys at an urban teaching hospital from 2010 to 2012 to examine the racial and ethnic differences in the perceived benefits and barriers to HPV vaccination and vaccine mandate acceptance among 18- to 22-year-old African American, Haitian, Caucasian, and Latino men. RESULTS: A total of 89 men participated (35% African American, 29% Haitian, 20% Latino, and 16% white). Participants from all ethnic groups perceived benefits to HPV vaccination but differed in their perceptions of barriers to vaccination as well as their acceptance of a vaccine mandate. CONCLUSIONS: Culturally competent educational messages may overcome ethnic differences in the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors regarding vaccination among college-aged men from an urban population.",0
1284,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patterns of cervical cancer incidence in Peru by examining variation in 2 common histopathologic types, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC), and analyzing trends over time. METHODS: Data on the incidence of invasive cervical cancer between 1984 and 2006 were obtained from 3 population-based cancer registries in Peru: Lima, Trujillo, and Arequipa. For each registry, data quality assessment was performed, crude and age-specific incidence was calculated, and time trends were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall and SCC incidence varied across registries but incidence of ADC did not. Overall and SCC incidence showed significant declines in Trujillo (P<0.05) and modest declines in Lima (P>0.05) over time. ADC incidence showed marginally significant increases among women aged 15-29 years in Trujillo (P=0.10) and modest increases among young women in Lima (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Population-based cancer registries were an efficient source of data for evaluating the incidence of cervical cancer once data quality had been established. Geographic and temporal variations in cervical cancer burden were documented in Peru. The trends suggest that cervical ADC is increasing among young women in urban Peru, particularly in Trujillo. We recommend supplementing current Papanicolaou test screening with complementary methods of cervical cancer control, including human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and HPV DNA testing.",0
1285,"OBJECTIVE: To explore parents' opinions of school-entry requirements for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. METHODS: We interviewed parents of vaccine-eligible girls attending medical appointments in an urban academic medical center and an affiliated community health center. We used qualitative methods to explore parents' opinions about mandating routine childhood vaccines and HPV vaccine, as well as their feelings about vaccinating their own daughters against HPV. RESULTS: We included 19 Caucasian, 18 African-American, 12 Afro-Caribbean, 3 African, and 21 Latino parents. Nearly all parents had allowed their children to receive routine vaccinations and expressed support for mandating these vaccines. Most parents also vaccinated their daughters against HPV: 100% of Caucasian parents, 90% of African-American parents, 73% of Afro-Caribbean/African parents, and 90% of Latino parents. Only 11% of Caucasian parents supported HPV vaccine mandates, however, compared with 78% of African-American, 60% of Afro-Caribbean/African, and 90% of Latino parents. Immigrants supported mandates more frequently than U.S.-born parents. Most Caucasian parents opposed mandatory HPV vaccination because they believed the HPV vaccine should be an individual decision because the virus can only be spread by sexual contact. African-American, Afro-Caribbean, African, and Latino parents generally viewed mandates as the most effective way to protect their daughters from cervical cancer. Latino parents gave special importance to protecting their daughters from sexually transmitted infections. CONCLUSION: Parents from different racial and ethnic backgrounds expressed unique perspectives about mandatory HPV vaccination. Caucasians were less likely than parents of other races/ethnicities to support vaccine mandates.",0
1286,"OBJECTIVE: To explore low-income minority parents' attitudes, intentions, and actions with regard to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for their daughters. STUDY DESIGN: Semistructured interviews were conducted in English and Spanish with parents of girls aged 11-18 who were attending clinic visits in an urban medical center and a community health center. We assessed intention with formal scales, probed parents' attitudes regarding vaccination with open-ended questions, and reviewed medical records to determine vaccination rates. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Seventy-six parents participated (43% African American, 28% Latino, and 26% Caucasian). Most were mothers, had completed high school, and described themselves as religious; nearly one-half were immigrants. Intention correlated highly with receipt of the vaccine; 91% of parents intended to vaccinate their daughters against HPV, and 89% of the girls received vaccination within 12 months of the interview. Qualitative analysis revealed that most parents focused on the vaccine's potential to prevent cervical cancer. Some parents expressed concerns about unknown side effects and promotion of unsafe sexual practices, but these concerns did not hinder acceptance in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the low-income minority parents surveyed viewed HPV vaccination as a way to protect their daughters from cancer, and thus chose to vaccinate their daughters.",0
1287,"OBJECTIVES: Little is known about fathers' attitudes toward human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in low-resource settings. We sought to determine the awareness of HPV vaccination among Honduran fathers, and to assess their intention to accept HPV vaccination for their sons and daughters. METHODS: We conducted 100 structured interviews of fathers recruited from medical and business settings between May 2007 and June 2008. After assessing baseline knowledge, fathers received a brief explanation of HPV infection, cervical cancer, genital warts, and HPV vaccination. They were then asked whether they would accept HPV vaccination for their sons and daughters. RESULTS: Prior to receiving information about HPV, 85% of fathers believed that cervical cancer was preventable, over two-thirds could correctly name some form of prevention, 22% of fathers had heard of HPV, and 17% had heard of HPV vaccination. After receiving HPV-related information, 100% of fathers intended to accept HPV vaccination for their sons and 94% intended to accept HPV vaccination for their daughters. CONCLUSIONS: Few Honduran fathers were aware of HPV or HPV vaccination, but after receiving information, most would accept HPV vaccination for their sons and daughters.",0
1288,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination remains underused in the United States, and few population-level studies on effectiveness exist. METHODS: We examined trends in rates of genital warts diagnoses and HPV vaccination rates (defined as receipt of 1 or more vaccine doses) among low-income and minority adolescents between 2004 and 2013. Data were obtained from a database containing de-identified medical record information including all outpatient visits to an urban medical center and 6 affiliated community health centers. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes were used to determine genital warts diagnoses. We estimated annual rates of genital warts for each period for females and males using an interrupted time-series Poisson regression model. RESULTS: As HPV vaccination rates in low-income, minority adolescents rose from 0% to 59% (females) and 0 to 41% (males) between 2004 and 2013, genital warts rates decreased from 3.5% (females) and 3.6% (males) to 1.5% (females) and 2.9% (males). Rates of genital warts decreased significantly for both females and males from the prevaccination to the postvaccination periods (P < 0.05 for both comparisons). Genital warts rates for males began to decrease after the introduction of female vaccination and continued to decrease after male vaccination was introduced. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of HPV vaccination correlated with lower rates of genital warts among a cohort of low-income and minority adolescents. Rates of genital warts began to decrease in females and males following the introduction of female vaccination and continued to fall after the introduction of male vaccination, indicating that male vaccination may confer additional benefit to both males and females over herd immunity alone, especially when vaccination rates are suboptimal.",0
1289,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death for women in Latin America, and vaccinating against human papillomavirus (HPV) has the potential to limit this disease. We sought to determine Honduran women's awareness of HPV vaccination and interest in vaccinating their daughters against HPV. METHODS: We interviewed mothers aged ≥17 at primary care clinics in Honduras. First, we collected demographic information and assessed knowledge related to cervical cancer prevention and awareness of HPV and HPV vaccination. Because most participants were not familiar with HPV, education about the relationships among HPV, sexual activity, and cervical cancer was provided before we asked participants if they would accept HPV vaccination for a 9-year-old daughter. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine predictors of vaccine acceptance. RESULTS: We interviewed 632 mothers. Only 13% had heard of HPV vaccination before the interview. After education, 91% would accept HPV vaccination for a 9-year-old daughter. Mothers who intended to vaccinate knew more at baseline about cervical cancer prevention than did those who did not endorse vaccination. Demographic characteristics did not predict vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: Few Honduran mothers were aware of HPV or HPV vaccination. However, most Honduran mothers would accept HPV vaccination for their daughters after receiving education about the relationship between HPV infection and cervical cancer. Baseline cervical cancer knowledge was associated with vaccine acceptance.",0
1290,"BACKGROUND: Although human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been available for males since 2009, its uptake remains low. In light of new recommendations for universal vaccination of males, understanding parental attitudes toward this vaccine is important. This study aimed to describe HPV-related knowledge and intention to accept HPV vaccination among White, Black and Latino parents of sons and to assess vaccination rates among their sons. METHODS: We interviewed parents (68 Black, 28 Latino and 24 White; mean age, 43.5) of sons (mean age, 14) attending an urban academic medical center and a community health center. Eligible parents self-identified as White, Black or Latino and spoke English, Spanish or Haitian-Creole. We collected demographic information, knowledge related to HPV vaccination, parents' intent to vaccinate sons and HPV vaccination rates. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used to describe data. RESULTS: Most parents were mothers, married, expressed a religious affiliation and had completed high school or college. Parents had limited knowledge about HPV; White parents were more knowledgeable than Black parents. Most parents (75%) intended to accept HPV vaccination if recommended by physicians; no racial differences were noted. However, only 30% of sons were vaccinated. Logistic regression indicated that internet use was negatively associated with intention to vaccinate. Intention to vaccinate, clinical site of care and having an older son were associated with vaccine receipt. CONCLUSIONS: Although parents in our study had limited understanding of HPV disease in males, most would vaccinate their sons if recommended by their physicians.",0
1291,"Background: Breast, cervical, and oral cancers contribute to majority of cancer deaths among women in India. However, there is poor implementation of screening programs at primary health care (PHC). There is a need to understand the perspectives of healthcare providers at PHC level for feasibility of implementation of a cost-effective cancer screening program, particularly in the rural and tribal areas that are under served by cancer services. Materials and Methods: A continuous medical education (CME) program on ""Prevention and early detection of common cancers"" was held for all Medical Officers of Palghar District, Maharashtra. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge, attitude, practices, perspectives regarding common cancers, screening methods, and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination. A pre- and post-assessment was carried out before the commencement and on completion of the CME among 76 participants. Results: Knowledge about etiology of common cancers was high; however, awareness of risk factors was low. There were knowledge gaps about HPV vaccination. There was overall improvement about the available screening methods and knowledge of HPV vaccine and dosages after the CME (pretest 65% to posttest 95%). Providers had no experience in performing cervical cancer screening on a routine basis. While the majority of the providers (97%) indicated that screening for cancer was essential and feasible at PHC level; however, training (52%) and resources (53%) would be needed. Conclusion: Healthcare providers though from the underserved tribal areas, were optimistic to implement screening for common cancers and were willing to take training for the same. This emphasizes the need for educating and training the healthcare providers with simple techniques for effective implementation of cancer screening programs in underserved areas.",0
1292,"BACKGROUND: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection. The main risk factors correlated with HPV infection are: early sexual debut, the number of partners, frequency and type of sexual contact and partner's sexual histories.We surveyed sexual habits among young people in order to provide information that might orient decision-makers in adopting HPV multi-cohort vaccination policies. METHODS: We administered a questionnaire to students (14-24 years old) in five Italian cities. RESULTS: 7298 questionnaires were analyzed (4962 females and 2336 males); 55.3% of females (95% CI 53.9-56.7) and 52.5% of males (95% CI 50.5-54.5) reported regular sexual activity. The mean age at sexual debut was 15.7 ± 1.6 and 15.6 ± 1.6 for females and males, respectively, and the median age was 16 for both sexes.With regard to contraceptive use during the last year, 63.6% of males and 62.8% of females responded affirmatively; 42.6% of males and 42.8% of females used condoms. CONCLUSION: The results reveal precocious sexual activity among respondents, with the mean age at first intercourse declining as age decreases. Condom use proved to be scant. Considering lifestyle-related risk factors, males appear to have a higher probability of acquiring HPV infection than females.These data support the importance of promoting multi-cohort HPV vaccination strategies for females up to 25 years of age. It is essential to improve vaccination coverage through different broad-spectrum strategies, including campaigns to increase awareness of sexually transmitted diseases and their prevention.",0
1293,"BACKGROUND: Infection with high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is strongly associated with anal cancer. However, detailed studies on HPV type distribution by gender and age are limited. METHODS: Retrospective study of 606 invasive anal cancers diagnosed between 1990 and 2005 in two large urban areas of the province of Québec, Canada. Cases were identified from hospitalization registry. Patient characteristics were collected from medical files. Archived anal squamous cancer specimens were available from 96 patients and were tested for HPV DNA and typing. Variant analysis was performed on 16 consecutive and 24 non-consecutive HPV16-positive samples to assess potential contamination during amplification. RESULTS: Among the 606 patients with anal cancers, 366 (60%) were women. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years. HPV was detected in 88/96 (92%) of cases. HPV16 was the most frequent type detected in 90% of HPV-positive specimens. Other types including 6, 11, 18, 33, 52, 53, 56, 58, 62 and 82 were also found. HPV 97 was not detected. HPV prevalence was associated with female gender and younger age. No contamination occurred during amplification as shown by the subset of 41 HPV16-positive samples, as 37, 2 and 1 isolates were from the European, African and Asian lineages, respectively. The most frequent variants were G1 (n=22) and the prototype (n=12). CONCLUSIONS: Women with anal cancer are at higher risk for anal HPV infection, and HPV infection, especially HPV16, is strongly associated with squamous anal cancer. Therefore, HPV vaccine could potentially prevent the occurrence of anal cancer in both men and women.",0
1294,"Introduction: cervical cancer is the most common genital tract malignancy among women in Nigeria. Cancer of the cervix is preceded by a curable premalignant stage which can be detected by screening. The disease can also be prevented by Human papillomavirus (HPV) immunization. Women living in slums usually have poor reproductive health knowledge and poor health behaviours. Mostly of low socioeconomic status, these women are at higher risk of cervical cancer. This study assessed the knowledge, attitude and preventive practices towards cervical cancer among women living in an urban slum in Lagos, Nigeria. Methods: this descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 305 women of reproductive age in Idi-Araba, Lagos, Nigeria. Multistage sampling method was used to select respondents. Data was collected using interviewer administered questionnaires. Analysis was done with SPSS 20 software. Results: only 39 (12.8%) had heard about cervical cancer. Knowledge of cervical cancer, screening and Human papilloma virus (HPV) immunization was poor. Most respondents (64.3%) did not consider themselves at risk for cervical cancer. However, majority (88.9%) were willing to undergo screening and 93.8% were willing to take HPV immunization or recommend the vaccine to a friend/relative. Only 2(0.7%) had done a cervical cancer screening test and none had taken HPV vaccine or immunized their eligible daughters. Conclusion: there is thus the need for increased awareness creation and health education programs on cervical cancer prevention among such population of women.",0
1295,"Objective: Cervical cancer (CC) screening by Pap smears has led to a decrease in the incidence of CC worldwide. Indeed, the incidence of CC in Switzerland is very low; however, there is a lack of data to evaluate the efficiency of the Pap smear as a screening tool. Until now, only Pap smears have been used and other methods such as the presence of an infection with HPV have not been integrated into the routine screening. The aim of this study is to evaluate trends in the incidence of CC and its precancerous lesions in Central Switzerland, which represents a rural region, with those in urban regions and the entire country of Switzerland. Methods: All conizations and CC registered between 2000 and 2014 at the Institute of Pathology at the Cantonal Hospital of Lucerne have been included in our study. The incidence of CC and its precancerous lesions have been categorized according to age, stage, morphology, and study period. Age-standardized incidence in the Canton of Zurich and the entire country served as reference for the assessment of trends in CC incidence in the study region. Results: In Central Switzerland, the number of conizations performed annually has more than doubled over the observed 15 years. There has been a significant increase in precancerous lesions, which were found in approximately 50% of conizations. The total number of CC diagnosed by conization increased by 37.5% and the total of CIN3 increased by 130%. Age-standardized incidence of CC and CIN3 increased from 2.4 to 3.3/100,000 and from 11.6 to 26.9/100,000, respectively. The incidence of CC was lower in Central Switzerland compared to incidence in the Canton of Zurich and in Switzerland generally. Conclusion: Approximately 50% of all conizations were performed on women without serious precancerous lesions. For this reason, we recommend the adaptation of screening modalities and the use of risk stratification to avoid overtreatment. In light of the forthcoming implementation of an HPV vaccination program, our data provides important baseline information.",0
1296,"Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmissible infection (STI) in the United States (US) and an important cause of several cancers. Vaccines that prevent HPV infections are now recommended for routine use in adolescents but coverage remains suboptimal in the US. Because they are often promoted as cancer prevention vaccines, little is known about parents' views on vaccination for prevention of an STI. METHODS: In this qualitative study, parents and caregivers of children ages 10-18 years completed an in-depth interview. Participants (n=38) were recruited from an urban hospital-based primary care centre serving a low-income population in the north-eastern US during May 2013-February 2014. Interviews were transcribed and coded using a thematic content approach. RESULTS: Five major themes emerged with relevance to the topic of HPV vaccination for STI prevention: (1) low awareness of HPV as an STI; (2) favourable opinions about STI prevention messages for vaccination, including at young ages; (3) salience of sexual mode of transmission, given the unpredictability of adolescent sexual behaviour and high rates of other STIs and teen pregnancy; (4) recognition that sexual health is a topic of conversation between adolescents and health care providers; and(5) relevance of personal experience. CONCLUSIONS: Discussing STI prevention in the context of HPV vaccination appears to be well accepted by urban, low-income minority families. In addition to providing information on cancer prevention, these messages may help to raise awareness, acceptability and uptake of HPV vaccines.",0
1297,"Compulsory vaccination is a frequently implemented policy option for ensuring comprehensive vaccine coverage. Ongoing controversies around human papillomavirus vaccine dissemination, and suboptimal coverage, suggest the value of assessing acceptability of compulsory vaccinations-particularly among likely target populations-in advance of their public availability to support evidence-informed interventions. With the first HIV vaccine to demonstrate partial efficacy in a large-scale clinical trial, we examined individual characteristics and attitudes associated with support for compulsory HIV vaccination policy among a diverse, representative sample of adults attending probable HIV vaccine dissemination venues in a large urban county. Participants were recruited using three-stage probability sampling from likely venues for future HIV vaccine dissemination. We used Audio-CASI to administer a 60-min structured questionnaire. Items included endorsement of compulsory HIV vaccination policy, sociodemographic characteristics, injecting drug use, vaccine attitudes and perceived HIV risk. Among 1,225 participants (mean age = 36.8 years; 55.6 % males, 37.6 % non-English speaking Hispanic, 78.8 % heterosexual, 25.7 % injection drug users), almost half (48.2 %) endorsed a compulsory HIV vaccination policy. Non-English speaking Hispanics compared to whites, participants with less than high school education, higher positive vaccine attitude scores and higher perceived HIV risk were significantly more likely, and people who inject drugs significantly less likely to endorse compulsory HIV vaccination. Public health interventions to promote positive vaccine attitudes and accurate perceptions of HIV risk among vulnerable populations, and strategies tailored for people who inject drugs, may build support for compulsory HIV vaccination policy and promote broad HIV vaccine coverage.",0
1298,"BACKGROUND: African, Caribbean, and Black (Black) men account for 16.5% of new HIV diagnoses among men in Ontario. There is substantial evidence that sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are associated with increased likelihood of HIV infection; however, little is known regarding the prevalence of HIV/STI co-infections among Black men in Toronto. Progress has been made in understanding factors contributing to racial/ethnic disparities in HIV between among men who have sex with men (MSM). In this study, we investigate within-racial group patterns of HIV/STI infection between Black MSM and Black men who only have sex with women (MSW). METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological study was conducted with a non-probability sample of Black men recruited from Toronto, Ontario. Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interviews (ACASI) surveys were used to collect demographic and behavioral data. Biological specimens were collected to screen for HIV and other STIs. Chi-Square tests were used to compare the prevalence of (1) HIV and current STIs between MSM and MSW and (2) current STIs between people living with HIV and people not living with HIV. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess whether or not history of STIs were associated with current HIV infection. RESULTS: The prevalence of HIV (9.2%), syphilis (7.2%), hepatitis B (2.7%), and high-risk anal HPV (8.4%) and penile HPV (21.3%) infections were high in Black men (N = 487) and were significantly increased in Black MSM compared with MSW; the prevalence of syphilis and high-risk HPV were also increased in men living with HIV. Men with a history of syphilis (OR = 6.48, 95% CI: 2.68,15.71), genital warts (OR = 4.32, 95% CI: 1.79,10.43) or genital ulcers (OR = 21.3, 95% CI: 1.89,239.51) had an increased odds of HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: The HIV/STI prevalence was high among this sample of Black men, although the study design may have led to oversampling of men living with HIV. The associations between STIs and current HIV infection highlight the need for integrated of HIV/STI screening and treatment programs for Black men. Public health strategies are also needed to reduce disproportionate HIV/STI burden among Black MSM-including improving HPV vaccine coverage.",0
1299,"Cervical cancer and other human papillomavirus- (HPV-) related cancers are preventable, but preventive measures implemented in developing countries and especially in low-income rural regions have not been effective. Cervical cancer burden derived from sexually transmitted HPV infections is the heaviest in developing countries, and a dramatic increase in the number of cervical cancer cases is predicted, if no intervention is implemented in the near future. HPV vaccines offer an efficient way to prevent related cancers. Recently implemented school-based HPV vaccination demonstration programmes can help tackle the challenges linked with vaccine coverage, and access to vaccination and health services, but prevention strategies need to be modified according to regional characteristics. In urban regions WHO-recommended vaccination strategies might be enough to significantly reduce HPV-related disease burden, but in the rural regions additional vaccination strategies, vaccinating both sexes rather than only females when school attendance is the highest and applying a two-dose regime, need to be considered. From the point of view of both public health and ethics identification of the most effective prevention strategies is pivotal, especially when access to health services is limited. Considering cost-effectiveness versus justice further research on optional vaccination strategies is warranted.",0
1300,"Objective. To determine male vaccination rates with quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4) before and after the October 2011 national recommendation to routinely immunize adolescent males. Methods. We reviewed HPV4 dose 1 (HPV4-1) uptake in 292 adolescent males in our urban clinic prior to national recommendations and followed-up for HPV4 series completion rates. After national recommendation, 248 urban clinic and 247 suburban clinic males were reviewed for HPV4-1 uptake. Factors associated with HPV4-1 refusal were determined with multiple logistic regression. Results. Of the initial 292 males, 78% received HPV4-1 and 38% received the 3-dose series. After recommendation, HPV4-1 uptake was 59% and 7% in urban and suburban clinics, respectively. Variables associated with HPV4-1 uptake/refusal included time period, race, type of insurance, and receipt of concurrent vaccines. Conclusions. HPV4-1 vaccination rates in our urban clinic were high before and after routine HPV vaccine recommendations for adolescent males. Our vaccination rates were much higher than in a suburban practice.",0
1301,"BACKGROUND: There has been no population-based study on human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence or its genotypes in Bangladesh; a country eligible for GAVI funding for HPV vaccine. METHODS: We used baseline survey data of a prospective cohort study that was conducted in one urban and one rural area of Bangladesh. A total of 997 urban and 905 rural married women, aged 13 to 64 years, were enrolled in the baseline during July-December, 2011. Information was collected on socio-demographic characteristics and potential risk factors for HPV infection followed by gynecological examination and collection of endocervical samples using the cervical cytobrush (Digene cervical sampler). HPV DNA testing was done by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using a consensus primer set. RESULTS: Prevalence of any HPV infection was 7.7% with no significant difference between urban and rural women. Most common high-risk genotypes were HPV16, HPV66, HPV18, HPV45, HPV31 and HPV53. Urban women working as housemaids or garment workers were at higher risk of any HPV infection (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.13-4.11) compared to housewives. Rural women whose husband lived overseas were almost two times more likely to have any HPV infection (OR = 1.93; 95% CI 1.05-3.55) compared to women whose husbands lived with them. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HPV infection among Bangladeshi women is similar to other regions of Asia. However, type-specific patterns are different. The study findings will inform the formulation of HPV vaccination policies in Bangladesh, monitoring the impact of vaccination programmes, and the identification of target populations for screening.",0
1302,"AIMS: The aims of this study were (1) to estimate what proportion of rural females had received cervical screening, (2) to assess knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and demographics that influence cervical screening, and (3) to predict cervical screening accessibility based on demographic factors, knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes that influence cervical screening. METHODS: The study sample consisted of randomly selected, sexually active, rural females between 12 and 84 years of age. Five hundred fourteen females responded to an individually administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 514 participants, 91% had never had cervical screening and 81% had no previous knowledge of cervical screening tests; 80% of the group expressed positive beliefs about cervical screening tests after an educational intervention. Females who were financially independent were 6.61% more likely to access cervical screening compared with those who were dependent on their husbands. Females in mining villages were 4.47% more likely to access cervical screening than those in traditional rural reserve villages. Females in resettlement villages were 20% less likely to access cervical screening than those in traditional rural reserve villages. CONCLUSIONS: Accessibility of screening services could be improved through planning and implementation of screening programs involving community leaders and culturally appropriate messages. The government should incorporate the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in its immunization program for adolescents, and health education should be intensified to encourage women and their partners to comply with diagnostic and treatment regimens.",0
1303,"OBJECTIVES: Because little is known about the content of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine-related discussions with young adolescent girls in clinical settings, we explored communication between 11- and 12 year-old girls, mothers, and clinicians regarding HPV vaccines and concordance in reports of maternal and clinician communication. METHODS: We conducted individual interviews with 33 girls who had received the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in urban and suburban clinical settings, their mothers, and their clinicians. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods. RESULTS: From the perspectives of both girls and mothers, clinicians and parents were the preferred sources of HPV vaccine information for girls. Vaccine efficacy and risks/benefits of vaccination were the most commonly reported desired and actual topics of discussion by mothers, girls, and clinicians. Clinician recommendation of vaccination was reported by nearly one-fifth of girls and nearly half of mothers. The most common concordant messages were related to efficacy of the vaccine, with concordance in 70% of triads. The most common discordant messages were related to sexual health. Approximately half of clinicians (16) reported discussing sexual health, but only 5 mothers (15%) and 4 girls (12%) reported this. Triads recruited from suburban (vs. urban) practices had higher degrees of concordance in reported vaccination communication. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccine efficacy and safety are important topics for clinicians to discuss with both girls and mothers; educating mothers is important because parents are a preferred source of vaccine-related information for girls. Because girls may be missing important vaccine-related messages, they should be encouraged to actively engage in vaccine discussions.",0
1304,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare providers may vary their communications with different patients, which could give rise to differences in vaccination coverage. We examined demographic disparities in parental report of collaborative provider communication and implications for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. METHODS: Participants were 4,124 parents who completed the National Immunization Survey-Teen about daughters ages 13-17. We analyzed disparities in collaborative communication (mutual information exchange, deliberation, and decision) and whether they mediated the relationship between demographic characteristics and HPV vaccine initiation. RESULTS: Half of parents (53%) in the survey reported collaborative communication. Poor, less educated, Spanish-speaking, Southern, and rural parents, and parents of non-privately insured and Hispanic adolescents, were least likely to report collaborative communication (all p<.05). These disparities in communication accounted for geographic variation in HPV vaccination, specifically, the higher rates of uptake in the Northeast versus the South (mediation z=2.31, p<.01) and in urban/suburban vs. rural areas (mediation z=2.87, p<.01). These disparities were also associated with vaccination among subgroups with relatively high coverage, minimizing what could have been even higher uptake among Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic white adolescents (mediation z=-3.04, p<.01) and non-privately versus privately insured adolescents (mediation z=-3.67, p<.001). Controlling for provider recommendation attenuated some of these associations (but all p<.10). CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative communication showed widespread disparities, being least common among underserved groups. Collaborative communication helped account for differences-and lack of differences-in HPV vaccination among some subgroups of adolescent girls. Leveraging patient-provider communication, especially for underserved demographic groups, could improve HPV vaccination coverage.",0
1305,"BACKGROUND: To better target future immunization efforts, we assessed trends and disparities in human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine initiation among female adolescents in North Carolina over 3 years. METHODS: We analyzed data from a stratified random sample of 1,427 parents who, between 2008 and 2010, completed two linked telephone surveys: the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the Child Health Assessment and Monitoring Program surveys. Weighted analyses examined HPV vaccine initiation for girls ages 11 to 17 years. RESULTS: HPV vaccine initiation increased modestly over time (2008, 34%; 2009, 41%; 2010, 44%). This upward trend was present within 11 subpopulations of girls, including those who lived in rural areas, were of minority (non-black/non-white) race, or had not recently received a preventive check-up. Looking at differences between groups, HPV vaccine initiation was less common among girls who attended private versus public school, were younger, or lacked a recent check-up. However, the latter difference narrowed over time. The low level of initiation among girls without recent check-ups increased substantially (from 11% to 41%), whereas initiation among girls with recent visits improved little (from 39% to 44%, P(interaction) = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Although HPV vaccine initiation improved among several groups typically at higher risk for cervical cancer, the lack of progress among girls with recent check-ups suggests that missed opportunities for administration have hampered broader improvements. IMPACT: Achieving widespread coverage of HPV vaccine will require redoubled efforts to vaccinate adolescents during routine care.",0
1306,"PURPOSE: Cervical cancer incidence and mortality are higher for Hispanic women than for women in other population groups. However, the incidence could be reduced if teenaged Hispanic girls received the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine before they become sexually active. Unfortunately, few Hispanic girls receive this vaccine, which prevents cervical cancer. This study assessed Hispanic mothers' and girls' perceptions about cervical cancer, HPV, and the HPV vaccine. Results show factors that affect whether Hispanic high school girls receive the vaccine. METHODS: Twenty-four Hispanic mothers and 28 Hispanic girls from an urban school district in southeast Texas each participated in one of eight focus groups. Bilingual moderators facilitated the mothers' groups in English and Spanish and the girls' groups in English. We analyzed transcripts of the discussions and identified themes using the grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Our analysis found several themes that affect whether Hispanic girls get the HPV vaccine: gaps in knowledge; fears and concerns about the vaccine; sociocultural communication practices; and decision-making about HPV vaccination. Both mothers and girls had limited knowledge about cervical cancer, HPV, and the vaccine. Some girls who received the vaccine said they wished their mothers had involved them in making the decision. CONCLUSIONS: Findings may help in developing school or community-based educational programs for Hispanic families. Such programs should provide information on the HPV vaccine and the link between HPV and cervical cancer, and they should assist mothers and girls in communicating to make informed decisions about the vaccine.",0
1307,"OBJECTIVES: This study is among the first to examine metropolitan status differences in human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine initiation and completion among United States adolescent girls and is unique in its focus on how maternal socioeconomic status and health care access moderate metropolitan status differences in HPV vaccination. METHODS: Using cross-sectional data from 3573 girls aged 12-17 in the U.S. from the 2008-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we estimate main and interaction effects from binary logistic regression models to identify subgroups of girls for which there are metropolitan versus non-metropolitan differences in HPV vaccination. RESULTS: Overall 34 % of girls initiated vaccination, and 19 % completed all three shots. On average, there were no metropolitan status differences in vaccination odds. However, there were important subgroup differences. Among low-income girls and girls whose mothers did not complete high school, those in non-metropolitan areas had significantly higher probability of vaccine initiation than those in metropolitan areas. Among high-income girls and girls whose mothers completed college, those in metropolitan areas had significantly higher odds of vaccine initiation than those in non-metropolitan areas. Moreover, among girls whose mothers experienced a medical cost barrier, non-metropolitan girls were less likely to initiate vaccination compared to metropolitan girls. CONCLUSIONS: Mothers remain essential targets for public health efforts to increase HPV vaccination and combat cervical cancer. Public health experts who study barriers to HPV vaccination and physicians who come into contact with mothers should be aware of group-specific barriers to vaccination and employ more tailored efforts to increase vaccination.",0
1308,"PURPOSE: To explore whether sexually related behaviors predict refusal of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among a sample of women aged 18-26 in Appalachian Kentucky. METHODS: Using a convenience sample, young women attending health clinics and a community college in southeastern Kentucky were recruited to participate in a Women's Health Study. After completing a questionnaire, women received a free voucher for the three-dose HPV vaccine series. Completion of dose one served as the outcome variable. RESULTS: Women with a history of an abnormal Pap test were almost two times more likely to decline the HPV vaccine (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.20, p=0.015), and women who reported they had never had a Pap test were four times more likely to decline the vaccine (AOR 4.02, 95% CI 1.13-14.32, p=0.032). Women engaging in mutual masturbation were nearly two times more likely to decline the free vaccine (AOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.17-3.10, p=0.009). Use of hormonal birth control showed a protective effect against refusal of the free HPV vaccine (AOR 0.593, 95% CI 0.44-0.80, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among this sample of Appalachian women, those engaging in behaviors that increase their risk for HPV infection were more likely to refuse the vaccine. Conversely, those women engaging in protective health behaviors were more likely to accept the vaccine. These findings suggest that those women not being vaccinated may be the very group most likely to benefit from vaccination. Cervical cancer prevention programs need to be creative in efforts to reach young women most in need of the vaccine based on a higher profile of sexually related behaviors and the proxy measure of this risk (having an abnormal Pap test result).",0
1309,"While the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has potential to protect against the majority of HPV-associated cancers, vaccination rates in the United States remain low. Racial/ethnic and economic disparities exist for HPV vaccination completion rates. We conducted a mixed-methods study using the theory of planned behavior framework to explore attitudes and beliefs about HPV vaccination among urban, economically disadvantaged adolescents. Fifty adolescents aged 14-18 years were recruited from community-based organizations to complete a written survey and participate in a focus group. The mean age was 15.5 ± 1.3 years; 98 % were African American or mixed race; 64 % were female; 52 % reported previous sexual intercourse; 40 % reported receipt of ≥1 HPV vaccine dose. The knowledge deficit about the HPV vaccine was profound and seemed slightly greater among males. Mothers, fathers and grandmothers were mentioned as important referents for HPV vaccination, but peers and romantic partners were not. Common barriers to vaccination were lack of awareness, anticipated side effects (i.e., pain), and concerns about vaccine safety. Characteristics associated with ≥1 vaccine dose were: having heard of the HPV vaccine versus not (65 vs. 20 %, p = 0.002) and agreeing with the statement ""Most people I know would think HPV vaccine is good for your health"" versus not (67 vs. 27 %, p = 0.007). Our work indicates a profound lack of awareness about HPV vaccination as well as the important influence of parents among urban, economically-disadvantaged youth. Awareness of these attitudes and beliefs can assist providers and health officials by informing specific interventions to increase vaccine uptake.",0
1310,"PURPOSE: With new vaccination recommendations for adolescents, school-based immunization programs become a valuable alternative site for immunization. This study seeks to determine factors associated with parental willingness to utilize school-based programs for immunizations. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to the parents of 11-14-year-olds attending 7 middle schools in a large, urban public school district. Participants were asked multiple questions including medical home enrollment, primary language spoken at home, site of last immunization, and comfort with their child receiving specific vaccines during school hours. Frequencies, chi-square analyses, and logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0. RESULTS: A total of 615 parent questionnaires were included in the analyses; 81% of parents were Hispanic, 16% black, 39% spoke primarily English at home, and 77% indicated that they had a medical home for their child. Regarding specific vaccines, the largest percentage of parents were willing to have their child receive influenza vaccine (57%) and the smallest percentage were willing to have the human papillomavirus vaccine (27%) at school during school hours. Parents who had used a school-based clinic for their child's last immunization were more willing to receive each vaccine at school. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that there is significant interest and willingness among predominantly lower income, Hispanic middle school parents to have their children receive specific vaccines during school hours through school-based immunization programs. More study is needed among a more diverse population of parents to help target the various needs of parents and adolescents and ultimately increase adolescent immunization rates.",0
1311,"Reducing cervical cancer disparities in the United States requires intentional focus on structural barriers such as systems and policy that impact access to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, cervical cancer screening, and treatment. Such changes are difficult and often politicized. State comprehensive cancer control (CCC) plans are vehicles that, if designed well, can help build collective focus on structural changes. Study objectives were to identify the prioritization of cervical cancer in state CCC plans, the conceptualization of HPV within these plans, and the focus of plans on structural changes to reduce cervical cancer disparities. Data were gathered by systematic content analysis of CCC plans from 50 states and the District of Columbia from February-June 2014 for evidence of cervical cancer prioritization, conceptualization of HPV, and focus on structural barriers to cervical cancer vaccination, screening or treatment. Findings indicate that prioritization of cervical cancer within state CCC plans may not be a strong indicator of state efforts to reduce screening and treatment disparities. While a majority of plans reflected scientific evidence that HPV causes cervical and other cancers, they did not focus on structural elements impacting access to evidence-based interventions. Opportunities exist to improve state CCC plans by increasing their focus on structural interventions that impact cervical cancer prevention, detection, and treatment, particularly for the 41% of plans ending in 2015 and the 31% ending between 2016 and 2020. Future studies should focus on the use of policy tools in state CCC plans and their application to cervical cancer prevention and treatment.",0
1312,"PURPOSE: Parent-child conversations about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine may provide parents with the opportunity to talk with their daughters about sexual health. We sought to characterize mothers' communication with their adolescent daughters about HPV vaccine. METHODS: We surveyed 609 mothers of girls aged between 11 and 20 years living in North Carolina in Fall 2008. We used logistic regression to identify the correlates of mother-daughter communication. RESULTS: Most mothers (81%) reported having discussed HPV vaccine with their daughters. For almost half of these families (47%), discussion of HPV vaccine led to a conversation about sex. This was more common among mothers who believed that their daughters may be sexually active (odds ratio [OR]: 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-2.83), had greater knowledge of HPV vaccine (OR: 2.46; 95% CI: 1.07-5.64), lived in urban areas (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.21-2.54), or reported being born-again Christians (OR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.17-2.58). Most mothers who talked with their daughters about HPV vaccine reported having discussed the reasons for and against getting vaccinated (86%). Mothers most commonly reported having discussed the potential HPV vaccine benefits, usually protection against cervical cancer (56%), and less frequently reported having discussed the perceived disadvantages of HPV vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccine conversations may provide opportunities for sexual health promotion and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention.",0
1313,"Rationale: Geographic clusters of low vaccination uptake reduce the population-level efficacy of vaccination programs. However, little is known about the mechanisms that drive geographic patterns in vaccination rates. Traditional economic theory considers vaccination as a classic public good and suggests that free riding-individuals taking advantage of public goods by relying on others' immunization behavior without contributing toward them-is a primary cause of low vaccination rates. However, behavioral economics suggests that free riding does not fully explain observed individual behavior, and the presence of both high and low clusters of vaccination rates suggest that this theory alone does not fully explain geographic patterns of vaccination. Objective: We assessed geographic clustering of HPV vaccination uptake and examined the evidence for or against free riding in HPV vaccination decisions. Methods: We analyzed HPV vaccination decisions of low-income adolescent females (N = 601) residing in urban neighborhoods in Dallas, Texas, USA during 2011-2012. Spatial econometric models were estimated to assess the relationship between neighborhood vaccination rates and individual vaccination decisions. Results: We found a positive and significant relationship between individual HPV vaccination choices and the average neighborhood vaccination rate at the time parents were making vaccine decisions for their adolescent daughters while controlling for neighborhood sorting and other confounders. Conclusion: Individuals were more likely to complete the HPV vaccination series when others in their neighborhood had already completed the series. We do not find evidence for free riding in HPV vaccination decisions.",0
1314,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake for adolescents and young adults in the United States remains far from national goals. Using a multi-component intervention aligned with community-wide efforts, we implemented a quality improvement project to increase HPV vaccinations among 9-26 year-old male and female patients in an urban, low income, minority population family medicine residency practice. METHODS: The pre-intervention year was November 2, 2014 to October 31, 2015 and the intervention year was November 1, 2015 to October 31, 2016. Based on community input and published literature, the interventions were creative, practice-specific provider-, patient-, and system-level strategies. To compare pre- and post-intervention vaccinations, HPV vaccination data were extracted from an electronic medical record request for age-eligible patients seen in the practice during the intervention year. Chi-square, McNemar's and 2-tailed, 2-sample Z tests were used to test differences in vaccination initiation (≥1 dose) and completion (3 doses) across groups and over time. RESULTS: Despite high pre-intervention rates (58% and 75%), HPV vaccine initiation significantly increased 12.8 percentage points (PP) for males and 10.6 PP for females from pre- to post-intervention (P < 0.001). HPV vaccine completion also significantly increased 16 PP for males and 10.9 PP for females (P < 0.001). Young adult patients (18-26 years-old) had significant increases in completion rates (9.9 PP; P < 0.001), not observed among adolescents (20 PP; ns). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent and abundant positive HPV vaccination messaging, low-cost sensory rewards, process change, and community, clinician, and nonclinical staff engagement were associated with higher HPV vaccine initiation and completion, especially among young adults.",0
1315,"BACKGROUND: In 2013, Prince Edward Island was the first province to introduce HPV vaccine universally to grade six boys in a school-based program. Because uptake rates in boys are unknown in this type of vaccination program, uptake of HPV vaccination in boys was measured and compared with uptake rates in girls and then analyzed with factors such as county, urban-rural location of the school, and school board to identify where the vaccine program could be improved. METHODS: HPV vaccination records from the provincial childhood immunization registry in PEI were merged with Department of Education data containing all grade six girls and boys in PEI. Vaccine uptakes between years and between sexes were compared using two sample tests of proportions. Logistic regression modeling which accounted for the hierarchical nature of the data was used to analyze associations between factors and uptake rates. RESULTS: Although uptake was high in boys and girls, a significantly greater proportion of girls (85%) received all three doses of the HPV vaccine compared to boys (79%; p=0.004). The odds of grade six girls being fully vaccinated for HPV were 1.5 times greater than of grade six boys, and the odds of students in the English Language School Board receiving all three doses were more than twice as great as the odds of French Language School Board students. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination for boys in PEI has had a successful launch, almost reaching the Canadian Immunization Committee recommendations of >80% for the early years of a program. PEI has a highly organized Public Health Nursing program that is involved in all childhood and school-based vaccinations in PEI and in this context very high coverage rates were obtained. Areas to target for improving uptake include the boys and the students in the French Language School Board.",0
1316,"BACKGROUND: High-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) infections and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions occur frequently in young women. The available vaccines cover up to seven hr-HPV genotypes (HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, HPV45, HPV52 and HPV58) and two low-risk HPV types (HPV6 and HPV11). The objective of this study was to describe the hr-HPV genotypes present among HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected young women in rural high schools. METHODS: Cervicovaginal lavages were obtained from sexually active young women recruited from high schools in KwaZulu-Natal (n = 1223). HPV testing was done by the polymerase chain reaction using GP5+/GP6 + primers and enzyme immunoassay. HIV testing was done using rapid test kits. RESULTS: Of the 1223 cervicovaginal lavages, 301 (25%) were positive for hr-HPV. The HPV prevalence was higher in HIV infected (32.20%, 95% CI: 0.27-0.38) than in HIV-uninfected women (22.50%, 95% CI: 0.21-0.26), (p = .001). Similarly, multiple infections were slightly more common in HIV infected (59.32%) than in HIV-uninfected women (53.51%), (p = .37). The nine predominant genotypes in descending order were HPV types 16 (n = 99, 22.10%), 51 (n = 58, 12.91%), 18 (n = 56, 12.50%), 35 (n = 50, 11.10%), 33 (n = 47, 10.82%), 56 (n = 42, 9.31%), 45 (n = 34, 7.60%), 52 (n = 32, 7.14%) and 59 (n = 31, 6.91%). HPV 35, 51, 56 and 59 (40.62%), which are not covered by any vaccine, were among the most prevalent in the schools of KwaZulu-Natal. CONCLUSION: Four of the most predominant high-risk HPV types in this region are not covered by the new nine-valent HPV vaccine.",0
1317,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a major problem in women and it is important to find a suitable and acceptable screening method, especially among young in low-resource areas for future human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine follow-up investigations. The study sought to test the acceptability of self-sampling as well as the suitability of the specimen collecting devices. METHODS: Ninety-eight young women from rural KwaZulu-Natal were enrolled between March and July 2014. Collected genital specimens were transferred to colour indicator cards for HPV detection. Participants answered a questionnaire where they described their experiences with self-sampling. Samples were tested for high-risk HPV using GP5/6+ PCR. RESULTS: Of the enrolled participants, 91 answered questionnaires and indicated that self-sampling was preferred by 51/91 (56%) women while 40/91 (44%) indicated preference for sampling by a doctor (p = 0.023). The majority, 64% were comfortable using a swab, 22% preferred a brush while 11% were comfortable with both devices. Of the 98 self-sampled specimens 61 were negative for HPV in both specimens while 37 were HPV-positive in either brush or swab. Of the 37, 26 (70%) were HPV-positive in both brush and swab (kappa = 0.743) and 11 (30%) were discordant. CONCLUSIONS: Self-sampling was acceptable to the majority of participants in this rural area. The Dacron swab was the preferred device, and can be used in combination with colour indicator cards for comfortable self-sampling, easy storage and transport of specimens plus detection.",0
1318,"BACKGROUND: Missed opportunities for human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination are common, presenting a barrier to achieving widespread vaccine coverage and preventing infection. PURPOSE: To compare the impact of clinician- versus family-focused decision support, none, or both on captured opportunities for HPV vaccination. DESIGN: Twelve-month cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in 2010-2011. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Adolescent girls aged 11-17 years due for HPV Dose 1, 2, or 3 receiving care at primary care practices. INTERVENTION: Twenty-two primary care practices were cluster randomized to receive a three-part clinician-focused intervention (educational sessions, electronic health record-based alerts, and performance feedback) or none. Within each practice, girls were randomized at the patient level to receive family-focused, automated, educational phone calls or none. Randomization resulted in four groups: clinician-focused, family-focused, combined, or no intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardized proportions of captured opportunities (due vaccine received at clinician visit) were calculated among girls in each study arm. Analyses were conducted in 2013. RESULTS: Among 17,016 adolescent girls and their 32,472 visits (14,247 preventive, 18,225 acute), more HPV opportunities were captured at preventive than acute visits (36% vs 4%, p<0.001). At preventive visits, the clinician intervention increased captured opportunities by 9 percentage points for HPV-1 and 6 percentage points for HPV-3 (p≤0.01), but not HPV-2. At acute visits, the clinician and combined interventions significantly improved captured opportunities for all three doses (p≤0.01). The family intervention was similar to none. Results differed by practice setting; at preventive visits, the clinician intervention was more effective for HPV-1 in suburban than urban settings, whereas at acute visits, the clinician intervention was more effective for all doses at urban practices. CONCLUSIONS: Clinician-focused decision support is a more effective strategy than family-focused to prevent missed HPV vaccination opportunities. Given the persistence of missed opportunities even in intervention groups, complementary strategies are needed. This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT01159093.",0
1319,"OBJECTIVE: To examine HPV vaccine awareness and receptivity among adolescents and young adults in Senegal. METHODS: Participants from six high schools and five community centres across five regions of Senegal (n = 2286) completed a self-administered questionnaire in October and November 2014. The study assessed HPV awareness and receptivity towards receiving the HPV vaccine. Multivariable logistic regression explored statistically significant relationships between the predictor variables and both outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-seven percent had heard of HPV. Among those who had heard of HPV (n = 616), only 28% indicated willingness to vaccinate. Multivariable analysis showed that respondents from rural areas had 63% higher odds (95% CI: 1.24, 2.12) of having heard of HPV than those in urban areas. Respondents with fathers who had completed higher education had 41% higher odds (95% CI: 1.04, 1.92) of being aware of HPV (P < 0.05); however, every level of father's education (as compared to no education at all) was negatively associated with willingness to vaccinate. Respondents who had previously spoken to a healthcare professional about the HPV vaccine had 80% higher odds (95% CI: 1.16, 2.81) of willingness to vaccinate than those who did not speak to a provider about the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers and parents are important stakeholders in disseminating HPV vaccine information. Given the overall low levels of awareness, there is a great opportunity for public health communication efforts to craft health messaging and information in a way to maximise receptivity, outlining benefits and providing information on the minimal risks associated with the vaccine.",0
1320,"OBJECTIVE: Worldwide, 530,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 275,000 die annually. India bears the greatest burden of the disease with 132,000 cases and 74,000 deaths yearly. Widespread uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine could reduce incidence and mortality by two-thirds. This study explored obstacles and facilitators of parental acceptability of HPV vaccine. METHODS: In 2010, questionnaires were sent home with a random sample of 800 girls attending 12 schools in Mysore city to be completed by a parent. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equation to account for potential clustering by school. RESULTS: Of the 797 completed surveys; 71% reported willingness to accept HPV vaccine for their daughters. The adjusted odds of acceptance was higher among participants who received recommendation from their parents, perceived cervical cancer as a serious disease, believed that HPV vaccine was safe, or felt that vaccination was a good way to protect against cervical cancer. Parents who had concerns about vaccine side-effects or thought that it would cause pain had lower odds of acceptance. CONCLUSION: Future promotion of vaccine should emphasize safety of immunization and involve promotion to the extended family, so that they actively recommend immunization of young adolescent girls.",0
1321,"BACKGROUND: Peru is characterized by high cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates. The country also experiences significant gaps in quality cervical cancer screening coverage for the population. OBJECTIVE: This descriptive mixed methods study conducted in Cusco, Peru, aimed to assess the attitudes and perceptions of medical staff, health care workers, and patients toward a cervical cancer screening program that included both clinic-based and community outreach services conducted by a nongovernmental organization clinic (CerviCusco). The study also explored patient knowledge and attitudes around cervical cancer and about the human papillomavirus (HPV) to inform patient education efforts. METHODS: The study employed structured interviews with key informants (n=16) primarily from CerviCusco, which provides cervical cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment services, and surveys with a sample of patients (n=30) receiving services at the clinic and at screening campaigns. RESULTS: The majority of key informant medical staff participants felt that the general public had a very negative view of government health services. One theme running throughout the interviews was the perception that the general population lacked a culture of preventive health care and would wait until symptoms were severe before seeking treatment. Regarding services that were received by patients at CerviCusco, the participants responded that the prices were reasonable and more affordable than some private clinics. Patients attending the rural health campaigns liked that the services were free and of good quality. CONCLUSION: CerviCusco has demonstrated its capacity to provide screening outreach campaigns to populations who had not previously had access to liquid-based cytology services. The finding that patients had generally low levels of knowledge about cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine prompted the development of culturally and linguistically appropriate educational and promotional materials to improve the educational component of the periodic campaigns conducted primarily in rural areas of Andean Peru.",0
1322,"BACKGROUND: In 2011, the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for male adolescents. METHODS: We used the 2013 National Immunization Survey-Teen data to assess HPV vaccine uptake (≥1 dose) and series completion (≥3 doses). Multivariable logistic regression analysis and a predictive marginal model were conducted to identify independent predictors of vaccination among adolescent males aged 13 to 17 years. RESULTS: HPV vaccination coverage with ≥1 dose was 34.6%, and series completion (≥3 doses) was 13.9%. Coverage was significantly higher among non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics compared with non-Hispanic white male adolescents. Multivariable logistic regression showed that characteristics independently associated with a higher likelihood of HPV vaccination (≥1 dose) included being non-Hispanic black race or Hispanic ethnicity; having mothers who were widowed, divorced, or separated; having 1 to 3 physician contacts in the past 12 months; a well-child visit at age 11 to 12 years; having 1 or 2 vaccination providers; living in urban or suburban areas; and receiving vaccinations from >1 type of facility (P < .05). Having mothers with some college or college education, having a higher family income to poverty ratio, living in the South or Midwest, and receiving vaccinations from all sexually transmitted diseases/school/teen clinics or other facilities were independently associated with a lower likelihood of HPV vaccination (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Following recommendations for routine HPV vaccination among male adolescents, uptake in 2013 was low in this population. Increased efforts are needed to improve vaccination coverage, especially for those who are least likely to be vaccinated.",0
1323,"Objective: To assess human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage among adolescents by provider recommendation status.Study Design: The 2011-2016 National Immunization Survey-Teen data were used to assess HPV vaccination coverage among male adolescents by provider recommendation status. Multivariable logistic analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between HPV vaccination and provider recommendation status.Results: HPV vaccination coverage among male adolescents increased from 8.3% in 2011 to 57.3% in 2016. Likewise, the prevalence of provider recommendation increased from 14.2% in 2011 to 65.5% in 2016. In 2016, HPV coverage was higher in male adolescents with a provider recommendation than in those without a provider recommendation (68.8% vs 35.4%). In multivariable logistic regression, characteristics independently associated with a higher likelihood of HPV vaccination included receipt of a provider recommendation, age 16-17 years, black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, any Medicaid insurance, ≥2 physician contacts in the previous 12 months, and urban or suburban residence. Participants with a mother with some college or a college degree, those with a mother aged 35-44 years, and those who did not have a well-child visit at age 11-12 years had a lower likelihood of HPV vaccination.Conclusions: Receiving a provider recommendation for vaccination was significantly associated with receipt of HPV vaccine among male adolescents, indicating that a provider recommendation for vaccination is an important approach to increase vaccination coverage. Evidence-based strategies, such as standing orders and provider reminders, alone or in combination with health system interventions, are useful for increasing provider recommendations and HPV vaccination coverage among male adolescents.",0
1324,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in women pre-sexual debut has been demonstrated in many countries. This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a 3-dose bivalent HPV vaccination at ages 12 to 55 year in both rural and urban settings in China. METHODS: The Markov cohort model simulated the natural history of HPV infection and included the effect of screening and HPV vaccination over the lifetime of a 100,000 female cohort. Transition probabilities and utilities were obtained from published literature. Cost data were estimated by Delphi panel using healthcare payers' perspective. Vaccine cost was assumed Hong Kong listed price. Vaccine efficacy (VE) was based on the PATRICIA trial data assuming VE irrespective of HPV type at all ages on incident HPV. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3 %. Cervical cancer cases and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for vaccination and screening compared with screening alone were estimated for each vaccination age. Reduced VE in women post-sexual debut were investigated in scenario analyses. RESULTS: With 70 % vaccination coverage, a reduction of cancer cases varying from 585 to 33 in rural and 691 to 32 in urban were estimated at ages 12 to 55, respectively. The discounted ICERs of vaccination at any age under 23 years in rural and any age under 25 years in urban were lower than the current threshold. Scenario analyses with lower VE post-sexual debut confirmed the results with age 20 in rural and 21 in urban had consistent lower ICERs. The more 'catch-up' cohorts vaccinated at the start of a program, the more cancer lesions are avoided in the long-term. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination at any age under 23 years old in rural and any age under 25 years old in urban were cost-effective. Catch-up to the age of 25 years in rural and urban could still be cost-effective.",0
1325,"OBJECTIVES: Information on healthcare costs in low-and-middle-income countries is limited. This study presents a framework to perform healthcare cost estimates for each province in China. METHODS: This study has two aims. Using cervical cancer as an example, the first aim is to use data (including micro-costing data) from one province to derive estimates for other provinces in China. This used provincial and national Chinese-language statistical reports and considered levels of service delivery, hospital-seeking behaviour, and the urban/rural population distribution. The second aim is to characterise the relationship between the reference costs estimated using the method mentioned above and two sets of cost estimates derived using simplified cost-scaling method with per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the Human Development Index (HDI). For simplified methods, regression modelling characterised the relationship between province-specific healthcare costs and macro-economic indicators, then we used the exponential fit to extrapolate costs. RESULTS: Using the reference method, the estimated costs were found to vary substantially by urban/rural regions and between provinces; the ratios of highest to lowest provincial costs were 3.5 for visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), 4.4 for cold knife conisation (CKC) and 4.6 for stage II cancer treatment. The HDI-based scaling method generally resulted in a better fit to reference costs than the GDP method. CONCLUSIONS: These reference costs for cervical cancer can inform cost-effectiveness evaluation of cervical screening and HPV vaccination in China. HDI-based methods for cost-scaling-based on social, as well as purely economic, factors-have potential to provide more accurate estimates.",0
1326,"Background: Little is known about the knowledge and attitudes towards human papillomavirus (HPV) and its vaccines among adolescents in mainland China. Also, limited information has been available on how to improve their knowledge and willingness towards HPV and its vaccines to ensure a successful vaccination program in the future.Methods: This was a school-based interventional follow-up study. One urban and one rural junior middle school in Chengdu were selected by convenience sampling. At baseline, half of the grade one students were randomly selected as controls and the rest were interventions. A set of self-administered questionnaires on HPV and its vaccines were completed by both groups at baseline. After that, only the intervention group received a PowerPoint-oriented health education and finished the post-education questionnaires. One year later, both groups completed the same questionnaires as the follow-up survey.Results: In total, 1675 students finished the pre-intervention questionnaires; 751 were from the control group and 924 were from the intervention group. Among them, only 34.3% had heard of cervical cancer/genital warts, while only 15.1% of them had ever heard of HPV. However, 55.2% of students showed their willingness to be vaccinated even before any intervention. Seven variables were found to be associated with the willingness to be vaccinated at baseline. Immediately after the intervention, 88.4% of students were willing to vaccinate themselves. After 1 year, the effectiveness of intervention remained but decreased. Compared with the control group, the intervention group was more aware about cervical cancer, HPV and its vaccines with statistical significance. However, the level of HPV knowledge and willingness to be vaccinated among the intervention group had significantly decreased compared with that immediately after the intervention (P < 0.001).Conclusions: The baseline level of knowledge on HPV, its vaccines, and cervical cancer was very low among junior middle school students in Chengdu, China. However, the willingness to be vaccinated seemed positive. School-based health education is effective and appropriate in increasing the awareness of HPV and willingness towards its vaccines. Regular health education on HPV and cervical cancer prevention at a shorter interval should be guaranteed to ensure continuous effectiveness.",0
1327,"Background: Statistics regarding HPV prevalence and cervical cancer rates in rural China are high, however, low levels of HPV awareness and HPV-related knowledge pose a great challenge for cervical cancer control.Methods: The authors conducted an educational intervention study, which was embedded in a cervical cancer screening project in Yangcheng county, Shanxi Province, China from October to December, 2011 and was designed to assess the short-term effectiveness of a hospital-based, brief, HPV-focused session on rural Chinese women's knowledge and attitudes. Student's t-test was used when comparing quantitative variables. Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact tests was used when comparing qualitative variables.Results: We found that following the intervention, significant increases were detected in awareness regarding HPV (5.9 % vs. 59 %, p < 0.001) and cervical cancer (63.0 % vs. 89.2 %, p < 0.001). Changes were also observed regarding women's intention to vaccinate themselves (82.0 % vs. 89.0 %, p = 0.001) and their daughters (82.9 % vs. 88.0 %, p = 0.011), although the impact was more modest compared with the impact on change of awareness. Among women who were aware of HPV, 60.3 % knew that cervical cancer is related to HPV, while only 5.0 % knew the relationship between HPV and genital warts after the educational intervention.Conclusions: Educational campaigns, particularly those targeting women with limited education and poor access to public media or other educational channels are needed to improve knowledge regarding HPV in the general population.",0
1328,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a prerequisite of cervical cancer, the leading cause of cancer mortality in Ethiopian women today. Data on Ethiopian cervical HPV prevalence and genotype distribution are rare, but essential as pre-vaccine baseline data to monitor changes after initiating HPV vaccination. The objectives of this study were to assess the cervical HPV prevalence, genotype distribution and associated correlates among female hospital outpatients in rural Ethiopia. METHODS: We examined a consecutive sample of 537 women 15-64 years of age in rural Ethiopia between November and December 2006. Screening for low risk (LR) and high-risk (HR) cervical HPV infection was performed and HR positive samples were genotyped with a GP5+/6 + - and SPF10-primer based system. RESULTS: The age-standardized prevalence of HPV, HPV HR and HPV LR infection was 17.3% (95% CI 14.1-20.5), 15.8% (95% CI 12.7-18.9) and 3.9% (95% CI 2.3-5.6), respectively. Among HC2 HPV HR positive infections (n = 86), the most common genotype was HPV 16 (24.4%), followed by 52 (11.6%), 56 (10.5%) and 31 (10.5%). Non-married relationship and widowhood, increasing number of lifetime sexual partners, human immunodeficiency virus infection and non-traditional housing type, but not age, were significantly associated with HR HPV infection. CONCLUSIONS: These results on cervical HPV prevalence and genotype distribution may serve as baseline data in evaluating the impact of future HPV vaccination programmes in rural Ethiopia.",0
1329,"INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer screening and existing health insurance schemes in China fall short of reaching women with prevention and treatment services, especially in rural areas where the disease burden is greatest. We conducted an extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) to evaluate public financing of HPV vaccination to prevent cervical cancer, adding new dimensions to conventional cost-effectiveness analysis through an explicit inclusion of equity and impact on financial risk protection. METHODS: We synthesized available epidemiological, clinical, and economic data from China using an individual-based Monte Carlo simulation model of cervical cancer to estimate the distribution of deaths averted by income quintile, comparing vaccination plus screening against current practice. We also estimated reductions in cervical cancer incidence, net costs to the government (HPV vaccination costs minus cervical cancer treatment costs averted), and patient cost savings, as well as the incremental government health care costs per death averted. RESULTS: HPV vaccination is cost-effective across all income groups when the cost is less than US $50 per vaccinated girl. Compared to screening alone, adding preadolescent HPV vaccination followed by cervical cancer screening in adulthood could reduce cancer by 44 percent across all income groups, while providing relatively higher financial protection to the poorest women. The absolute numbers of cervical cancer deaths averted and the financial risk protection from HPV vaccination are highest among women in the lowest quintile; women in the bottom income quintiles received higher benefits than those in the upper wealth quintiles. Patient cost savings represent a large proportion of poor women's average per capita income, reaching 60 percent among women in the bottom income quintile and declining to 15 percent among women in the wealthiest quintile.",0
1330,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is identified as the leading cause of cervical cancer which is the second most common cancer of females in the world. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a community-based intervention on knowledge and practice of HPV prevention among married females aged 15 to 49 in rural areas, Vietnam. This study used a quasi-experimental design with serial cross-sectional surveys at one intervention commune (Chi Linh, Hai Duong) and one control commune at other province (Thanh Thuy, Phu Tho). Number of participants in these surveys were respectively 317 and 320 in Chi Linh and 334 and 335 in Thanh Thuy at pre- and postintervention period. The time of intervention was 15 months from April 2015 to June 2016. The study used behavior models to build up a logical framework for identifying related factors of knowledge and practice among females and developing intervention strategies. A difference-in-differences analysis approach was used to evaluate the effects of this intervention program. The study identified that the intervention had a significant change of knowledge of HPV prevention among married females after the intervention (odds ratio = 3.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-7.66) after adjusting for other confounders but no any significant change of practice of HPV prevention (eg, condom use, numbers of sexual partner, HPV vaccination, and screening test for cervical cancer). This might be caused by a short intervention program that did not lead to changes of practice but only change of knowledge.",0
1331,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined strategy of human papillomavirus virus (HPV) vaccination and high-risk HPV screening to reduce the occurrence of anogenital and oropharyngeal neoplasms among men who have sex with men, people with HIV, homeless people, transgender women, female sex workers and rape victims. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This mixed methods study evaluates the effectiveness of a combined vaccination-screening strategy to reduce HPV prevalence/incidence and occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2+ and/or anal intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2+, using Kaplan-Meier. The time-to-event method will evaluate time from positive results for specific anogenital HPV to incidence of anogenital lesions containing that HPV type. RESULTS: People vaccinated against HPV and screened for HPV as a primary test will have lower prevalence and incidence of HPV infection and consequently lower frequency of HPV-related anogenital and oropharyngeal lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Thisstudy will generate scientific evidence on effectiveness of a combined vaccination-screening strategy to reduce the burden of HPV-associated neoplasms.",0
1332,"BACKGROUND: Inadequate physician adherence to guidelines has received scant attention as a possible cause of suboptimal human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates. We assessed the extent to which primary care physicians (PCPs) adhere to clinical guidelines and their reported intentions to prescribe HPV vaccine to females in the targeted age group, and how this is influenced by perceptions of guideline clarity and other factors. METHODS: We surveyed 301 PCPs to explore their sociodemographic and practice-related characteristics, beliefs, professional norms, and perceived barriers to administer HPV vaccine. Logistic regression predicted the likelihood to prescribe HPV vaccine to 11- and 12-year-old girls on an array of variables hypothesized to influence physicians' recommendations. RESULTS: Only 67% of PCPs reported being likely to prescribe HPV vaccine to 11- and 12-year-old patients. PCPs were more likely to prescribe vaccine to 11- and 12-year-old girls if they believed HPV vaccine guidelines were clear (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.03-3.35), agreed with a mandate requirement (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.01-5.61), felt comfortable discussing HPV vaccination with early adolescent girls (OR, 5.10; 95% CI, 2.75-9.45), and had at least 25% of their patients using public assistance to pay for their clinic visits (OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 1.91-7.34). Practice specialty (family physicians or pediatricians) and region were not significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs exhibit moderate levels of adherence to professional guidelines regarding HPV vaccination. Potential public health benefits will not be realized without stronger efforts to improve the rates at which PCPs administer the vaccine, particularly to 11- and 12-year-olds for whom it is preferentially recommended.",0
1333,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the level of knowledge, attitude, acceptance, and willingness to pay (WTP) for HPV vaccination among female parents of girls aged 12-15 years in Thailand. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in eight schools across Bangkok. RESULTS: Of 1,200 questionnaires sent out, a total of 861 questionnaires were received. Knowledge regarding the HPV vaccine among parents was quite low. Only half of the parents knew about the link between HPV and cervical cancer while one-third of them knew that the vaccine should be administered to the children before they become sexually active. Nevertheless, vaccine acceptance was high if it was offered for free: 76.9% for the bivalent and 74.4% for the quadrivalent vaccine. The proportion of respondents who were willing to copay for the vaccine if it was not totally free was also high, ranging from 68.9% for the bivalent to 67.3% for the quadrivalent vaccine. No significant difference between bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines in terms of prevalence of acceptance and willingness to pay was found. About one-third of the participants, who were willing to copay for the vaccine if it was not offered for free, indicated that they would copay less than 500 baht (30 baht = approx US$1) for three doses of bivalent vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial effort should be made to educate parents prior to introduction of a national HPV vaccination program. In terms of acceptance, either bivalent or quadrivalent vaccines can be recommended.",0
1334,"OBJECTIVE: (1) To understand if awareness of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination's potential to prevent head and neck cancer improves acceptability of the vaccine in a large urban population and (2) to identify characteristics of those in whom such discussions would have the greatest impact. STUDY DESIGN: In-person, anonymous survey. SETTING: Academic public hospital between March 2014 and June 2014. SUBJECTS: Patients aged 12 to 24 years and their parents or guardians awaiting scheduled outpatient pediatric appointments. METHODS: Demographics and modified Carolina HPV Immunization Attitudes and Beliefs Scales data were cross-analyzed, followed by univariate binomial logistic regression to identify predictors for major outcomes of interest. RESULTS: More than 78% of those surveyed indicated they would be more receptive to the HPV vaccine if given strong evidence that it prevented head and neck cancer. Respondents were more likely to increase receptivity to HPV vaccination if they held the belief that they did not have enough information about the vaccine or indicated they preferred to wait because the vaccine was too new. CONCLUSION: Increasing public awareness of head and neck cancer prevention with HPV vaccination could increase HPV vaccination acceptance.",0
1335,"OBJECTIVE: As one of the fastest growing ethnic minority groups in the United States, Korean American (KA) women experience a heightened cervical cancer burden. The advent of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine offers an unprecedented opportunity to eliminate cervical cancer disparities in KA women. However, the uptake of HPV vaccine among KA adolescents remains suboptimal. Hence, we set out to explore knowledge, perceptions, and decision making about HPV vaccination among KA women. METHODS: We conducted four focus groups of 26 KA women who participated in a community-based, randomized, controlled trial to promote breast and cervical cancer screening. Focus group data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged from the focus groups: 1) limited awareness and knowledge of HPV vaccine, 2) perceptions and beliefs about HPV vaccination (acceptance, negative perceptions, ambivalence), 3) patterns of decision making about HPV vaccination (hierarchical, peer influenced, autonomous, and collaborative), and 4) promoting HPV education and information sharing in the Korean community. CONCLUSION: KA women are generally positive toward HPV vaccination, but lack awareness and knowledge about HPV. Culturally tailored HPV education programs based on KA women's decision-making patterns and effective information sharing by trustworthy sources in comfortable environments are suggested strategies to promote HPV vaccination in the KA community. The findings point to the need for a multilevel approach to addressing linguistic, cultural, and system barriers that the recent immigrant community faces in promoting HPV vaccinations. In the development of targeted interventions for KA women, educational strategies and patterns of decision making need to be considered.",0
1336,"BACKGROUND: A school-based program with quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was implemented in Alberta in 2008. We assessed the impact of this program on Pap test cytology results using databases of province-wide vaccination and cervical cancer screening. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study involving a cohort of women in Alberta born between 1994 and 1997 who had at least 1 Pap test between 2012 and 2015. Women with negative cytology results were controls. Women with low-grade (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) and high-grade (atypical squamous cells, cannot rule out a high-grade lesion; or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) cervical abnormalities were cases. Exposure status was assigned according to records of HPV vaccination. Odds ratios (ORs) for abnormal cytology results by vaccination status were adjusted for neighbourhood income, laboratory service, rural versus urban residency, and age. RESULTS: The total study population was 10 204. Adjusting for age, vaccinated women had a higher screening rate than unvaccinated women (13.0% v. 11.4%, p < 0.001). Among women who received full vaccination (≥ 3 doses), the adjusted OR for cervical abnormalities was 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.82). For high-grade lesions, the adjusted OR was 0.50 (95% CI 0.30-0.85). With 2-dose HPV vaccination, the adjusted OR for cervical abnormalities was 1.08 (95% CI 0.84-1.38). INTERPRETATION: Quadrivalent HPV vaccination significantly reduced high-grade cervical abnormalities but required 3 doses. Vaccination against HPV was associated with screening uptake. Population-based vaccination and screening programs should work together to optimize cervical cancer prevention.",0
1337,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine 3-dose completion rates among adolescent females in the US are low. Missed opportunities impede HPV vaccination coverage. METHODS: A population-based secondary data analysis of de-identified vaccination and demographic data from the Utah Statewide Immunization Information System (USIIS) was conducted. Records were included from 25,866 females ages 11-26 years at any time during 2008-2012 who received at least one of the following adolescent vaccinations documented in the USIIS: Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis), meningococcal, and/or influenza. A missed opportunity for HPV vaccination was defined as a clinical encounter where the patient received at least one adolescent vaccination, but not a HPV vaccine. RESULTS: Of 47,665 eligible visits, there were 20,911 missed opportunities (43.87%). Age group, race/ethnicity, and rurality were significantly associated with missed opportunity (p<0.0001). In a multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression model that included ethnicity, location and age, as fixed effects and subject as a random effect, Hispanics were less likely to have a missed opportunity than whites OR 0.59 (95% CI: 0.52-0.66), small rural more likely to have a missed opportunity than urban youth OR 1.8 (95% CI: 1.5-2.2), and preteens more likely than teens OR 2.4 (95% CI: 2.2-2.7). CONCLUSION: Missed clinical opportunities are a significant barrier to HPV vaccination among female adolescents. Interventions targeted at providers who serve patient groups with the highest missed opportunities are needed to achieve adequate protection from HPV-associated illnesses. IMPACT: This is one of the first studies to utilize state immunization information system data to assess missed opportunities for HPV vaccination.",0
1338,"BACKGROUND: Few previous investigations on correlates of HPV vaccine uptake have included Hispanics, a group known to have a disproportionately high risk of cervical cancer. METHODS: Rural Hispanic mothers of daughters aged 9-17 (n=78) were recruited at local community events to participate in a standardized Spanish-language survey that examined factors related to vaccine uptake. RESULTS: Approximately 35% of the mothers reported that their daughter had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Mothers who had heard of the HPV vaccine were more likely to have a vaccinated daughter (p<.01). Mothers who thought their daughter's father would approve were more likely to have a vaccinated daughter (p=.004). Contrary to expectation, parents who believed that only one injection is necessary were more likely to have a vaccinated daughter (p=.009). CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccine education programs that target both parents are needed to ensure that Hispanic parents receive the complete HPV vaccine regimen.",0
1339,"Hispanic women have more than a 1.5-fold increased cervical cancer incidence and mortality compared to non-Hispanic white women in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control recommends the HPV vaccine for females at ages 11 and 12 years, though it is approved for females aged 9-26 to protect against the primary types of high-risk HPV (HPV-16 and HPV-18) that cause approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases. Few culturally-tailored Spanish HPV vaccine awareness programs have been developed. This study evaluates the efficacy of a Spanish radionovela as an educational tool. Rural Hispanic parents of daughters aged 9-17 (n = 88; 78 mothers and 10 fathers) were randomized to listen to the HPV vaccine radionovela or to another public service announcement. Participants completed a 30 min pretest posttest questionnaire. Parents who listened to the HPV radionovela (intervention group) scored higher on six knowledge and belief items. They were more likely to confirm that HPV is a common infection (70% vs. 48%, P = .002), to deny that women are able to detect HPV (53% vs. 31%, P = .003), to know vaccine age recommendations (87% vs. 68%, P = .003), and to confirm multiple doses (48% vs. 26%, P = .03) than control group parents. The HPV vaccine radionovela improved HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge and attitudes. Radionovela health education may be an efficacious strategy to increase HPV vaccine awareness among Hispanic parents.",0
1340,"Introduction: This study assesses the sociodemographic facilitators and barriers to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for diverse teens in a region with low HPV vaccination rates. Materials and Methods: In this community-based participatory research study, we surveyed adult family members of teens aged 11-17 years from African American, African refugee, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander community groups in Salt Lake City, Utah. Bivariate analyses assessed associations between sociodemographic characteristics and, respectively, HPV vaccine receipt and intentions for vaccination. Barriers to vaccination were also investigated. Results: Only 20% of participants had vaccinated at least one of their children with at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. HPV vaccination was significantly related to caregiver age (p=0.035), race/ethnicity (p=0.001), educational attainment (p=0.006), annual household income (p=0.0454), years in the United States (p=0.023), and caregiver parent birthplace (p=0.008). Among caregivers with unvaccinated children, intention to vaccinate was significantly related to race/ethnicity (p=0.048 for daughters; p=0.003 for sons), caregiver parent birthplace (p=0.023 for sons), health insurance coverage (p=0.028 for daughters; p=0.047 for sons), and type of health insurance coverage (p=0.008 for sons). The most frequently cited barriers to HPV vaccination were lack of knowledge about the HPV vaccine, costs, side effects, and child not being sexually active. Conclusions: Our results show substantially lower HPV vaccine coverage than both national and state rates, signaling the urgent need for multipronged HPV vaccination interventions within these communities; strategies are discussed.",0
1341,"BACKGROUND: Estimation of pre-immunisation prevalence of HPV and distribution of HPV types is fundamental to understanding the subsequent impact of HPV vaccination. We describe the type specific prevalence of HPV in females aged 20-21 in Scotland who attended or defaulted from cervical screening using three specimen types; from attenders liquid based cytology and from defaulters urine or self-taken swabs. METHODS: Residual liquid based cytology samples (n = 2148), collected from women aged 20-21 attending for their first smear were genotyped for HPV. A sample (n = 709) from women who had defaulted from screening was also made available for HPV testing through the use of postal testing kits (either urine samples (n = 378) or self-taken swabs (n = 331)). Estimates of prevalence weighted by deprivation, and for the postal testing kit, also by reminder status and specimen type were calculated for each HPV type. The distribution of HPV types were compared between specimen types and the occurrence of multiple high-risk infections examined. The influence of demographic factors on high-risk HPV positivity and multiple infections was examined via logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of any HPV in young women aged 20-21 was 32.2% for urine, 39.5% for self-taken swab, and 49.4% for LBC specimens. Infection with vaccine specific types (HPV 16, 18) or those associated with cross-protection (HPV 31, 33, 45, 51) was common. Individuals were more likely to test positive for high-risk HPV if they resided in an area of high deprivation or in a rural area. The overall distribution of HPV types did not vary between defaulters and attenders. Multiple infections occurred in 48.1% of high-risk HPV positive individuals. Excluding vaccine types the most common pairing was HPV 56 and 66. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding of the pre-immunisation prevalence of HPV in young women puts Scotland in a prime position to assess the early effect of vaccination as the first highly vaccinated cohorts of individuals enter the screening programme. Differences in results with different specimen types must be taken into account when monitoring the impact of vaccination programmes.",0
1342,"OBJECTIVE: Compare the effectiveness of community-based HPV-related education and onsite school-based vaccination versus community-based education only for increasing HPV vaccine uptake in a rural, medically underserved area. METHODS: Our cohort included 2307 Rio Grande City Consolidated Independent School District (RGCISD) middle school students from 3 schools enrolled in August 2016 and followed until April 2018. Using a quasi-experimental design, this study implemented an onsite school-based vaccination program and physician-led education on HPV and HPV vaccines for parents/guardians, school nurses/staff, and pediatric/family providers in the surrounding community (15-mile radius of RGCCISD) at 1 middle school (""intervention school""), and education-only for the remaining 2 schools (""comparison schools""). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's HPV-related educational materials supplemented the education. HPV vaccine status was obtained from school immunization records and the project's contracted vaccine vendor. HPV vaccine initiation and completion rates were compared pre and post intervention and between the intervention and comparison schools. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds of newly initiating/completing vaccination between the intervention and comparison schools. RESULTS: At baseline, the intervention school had lower HPV vaccine initiation and completion rates than the comparison schools (20.00% and 8.70% vs 28.97% and 14.56%). Post intervention, the intervention school had higher initiation and completion rates than the comparison schools (53.67% and 28.36% vs 41.56% and 20.53%). Students from the intervention school were over 3.6-times more likely to newly initiate/complete the HPV vaccinations than students from the comparison schools. CONCLUSION: The school with on-site vaccination events and community-based education had a higher adolescent HPV vaccination rate compared to schools that received community-based education only.",0
1343,"Objective: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was introduced in Japan in April 2013, as a national immunization program for girls aged 12-16 years, after an initial introduction in 2010 as a public-aid program for girls aged 13-16 years. The Yuri-Honjo district had the highest vaccine coverage among women aged 17-51 years in 2017, due to the original public-aid program. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in the vaccine types of HPV16/18 infections between 2008-2012 (pre-vaccine era) and 2013-2017 (vaccine era). Materials and Methods: We evaluated whether HPV vaccination was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of HPV16/18 and high-risk HPV and the incidence of HPV-associated cervical lesions. A total of 1,342 women aged 18-49 years, covering both the pre-vaccine and vaccine eras, who visited Yuri Kumiai General Hospital and underwent HPV genotype tests from June 2008 to December 2017 were compared. Results: Among women aged 18-24 years with higher vaccine coverage (68.2%), the prevalence of HPV16/18 and high-risk HPV decreased from 36.7% and 69.4%, respectively, in the pre-vaccine era to 5.8% and 50.0%, respectively, in the vaccine era (p=0.00013 and p=0.047, respectively). Among those with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2- and grade 2+, HPV16/18 prevalence decreased from 30.0% to 2.7% (p=0.0018) and from 81.8% to 36.4% (p=0.030), respectively. In this age group, the rate of HPV16/18 positivity decreased significantly. Among age groups with lower vaccine coverage, HPV prevalence did not significantly differ between the two eras. Conclusion: The prevalence of HPV16/18 and high-risk HPV significantly decreased in women aged 18-24 years, most of whom were vaccinated. HPV vaccination effectively reduced the prevalence of HPV16/18 infections in the Yuri-Honjo district.",0
1344,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in Thai women. Nevertheless, the preventive strategy such as HPV vaccination program has not been implemented at the national level. This study explored the HPV prevalence and genotypic distribution in a large cohort of Thai women. METHODS: A hospital-based cervical cancer screening program at Chulabhorn Hospital, Bangkok and a population-based screening program at a rural Pathum Thani Province were conducted using liquid-based cytology and HPV genotyping. RESULTS: Of 5906 women aged 20-70 years, Pap smear was abnormal in 4.9% and the overall HPV prevalence was 15.1%, with 6.4% high-risk (HR), 3.5% probable high-risk (PR), and 8.4% low-risk (LR) HPV. The prevalence and genotypic distribution were not significantly different between the two cohorts. Among HR-HPV genotypes, HPV52 was the most frequent (1.6%), followed by HPV16 (1.4%), HPV51 (0.9%), HPV58 (0.8%), HPV18 (0.6%), and HPV39 (0.6%). Among LR-HPV genotypes, HPV72 and HPV62 were the most frequent while HPV6 and HPV11 were rare. HPV infection was found to be proportionately high in young women, aged 20-30 years (25%) and decreasing with age (11% in women aged >50). The more severe abnormal cytology results, the higher positivity of HR-HPV infection was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, HPV52, HPV16, and HPV51 were identified as the most common HR-HPV genotypes in Thai women. This study contributes genotypic evidence that should be essential for the development of appropriate HPV vaccination program as part of Thailand's cervical cancer prevention strategies.",0
1345,"BACKGROUND: This study assessed human papillomavirus (HPV), cervical cancer, and HPV vaccine knowledge and awareness among women in two sub-populations in Nepal - Khokana, a traditional Newari village in the Lalitpur District about eight kilometers south of Kathmandu, and Sanphebagar, a village development committee within Achham District in rural Far-Western Nepal. METHODS: Study participants were recruited during health camps conducted by Nepal Fertility Care Center, a Nepali non-governmental organization. Experienced staff administered a Nepali language survey instrument that included questions on socio-demographics, reproductive health and knowledge on HPV, cervical cancer, and the HPV vaccine. RESULTS: Of the 749 participants, 387 (51.7%) were from Khokana and 362 (48.3%) were from Sanphebagar. Overall, 53.3% (n=372) of women were aware of cervical cancer with a significant difference between Khokana and Sanphebagar (63.3% vs 43.0%; p=0.001). Overall, 15.4% (n=107) of women had heard of HPV and 32% (n=34) of these women reported having heard of the HPV vaccine. If freely available, 77.5% of the women reported willingness to have their children vaccinated against HPV. Factors associated with cervical cancer awareness included knowledge of HPV (Khokana: Odds Ratio (OR)=24.5; (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.1-190.2, Sanphebagar: OR=14.8; 95% CI: 3.7-58.4)) and sexually transmitted infections (Khokana: OR=6.18; 95% CI: 3.1-12.4; Sanphebagar: OR=17.0; 95% CI: 7.3- 39.7) among other risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge and awareness of HPV, cervical cancer, and the HPV vaccine remains low among women in Khokana and Sanphebagar. Acceptance of a freely available HPV vaccine for children was high, indicating potentially high uptake rates in these communities.",0
1346,"PURPOSE: The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is of particular importance in American Indian/Alaska Native women because of the higher rate of cervical cancer incidence compared to non-Hispanic white women. To better understand HPV vaccine knowledge, attitudes, and practices among providers working with American Indian/Alaska Native populations, we conducted a provider survey in Indian Health Service, Tribal and Urban Indian (I/T/U) facilities. METHODS: During December 2009 and January 2010, we distributed an on-line survey to providers working in I/T/U facilities. We also conducted semistructured interviews with a subset of providers. RESULTS: There were 268 surveys and 51 provider interviews completed. Providers were more likely to administer vaccine to 13-18-year-olds (96%) than to other recommended age groups (89% to 11-12-year-olds and 64% to 19-26-year-olds). Perceived barriers to HPV vaccination for 9-18-year-olds included parental safety and moral/religious concerns. Funding was the main barrier for 19-26-year-olds. Overall, providers were very knowledgeable about HPV, although nearly half of all providers and most obstetricians/gynecologists thought that a pregnancy test should precede vaccination. Sixty-four percent of providers of patients receiving the vaccine do not routinely discuss the importance of cervical cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for HPV vaccination have been broadly implemented in I/T/U settings. Vaccination barriers identified by I/T/U providers are similar to those reported in other provider surveys. Provider education efforts should stress that pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination and the importance of communicating the need for continued cervical cancer screening.",0
1347,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) seroprevalence data have not previously been reported for different geographical regions of China. This study investigated the cross-sectional seroprevalence of antibodies to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 virus-like particles in Chinese women. METHODS: Population-based samples of women were enrolled from 2006 to 2007 in 3 rural and 2 urban areas of China. Each consenting woman completed a questionnaire and provided a blood sample. Serum antibodies were detected using a competitive Luminex immunoassay that measures antibodies to type-specific, neutralizing epitopes on the virus-like particles. RESULTS: A total of 4,731 women (median age 35, age range 14-54) were included, of which 4,211 were sexually active women (median age 37) and 520 virgins (median age 18). Low risk HPV 6 was the most common serotype detected (7.3%), followed by HPV 16 (5.6%), HPV 11 (2.9%), and HPV 18 (1.9%). Overall HPV seroprevalence to any type was significantly higher among sexually active women (15.8%) than virgins (2.5%) (P = 0.005). Overall seroprevalence among sexually active women gradually increased with age. Women from rural regions had significantly lower overall seroprevalence (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.6-0.9, versus metropolitan regions, P < 0.001). With increasing number of sexual partners, women were at higher risk of seropositivity of any type (OR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.7-3.9 for > = 4 partners versus 1 partner, P < 0.001). Wives were at higher risk of seropositivity for HPV 16/18/6/11 when reporting having a husband who had an extramarital sexual relationship (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.6-2.5, versus those whose husbands having no such relationship, P < 0.001). There was a strong association between HPV 16 seropositivity and presence of high-grade cervical lesions (OR = 6.5; 95% CI: 3.7-11.4, versus normal cervix, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HPV seroprevalence differed significantly by age, geography, and sexual behavior within China, which all should be considered when implementing an optimal prophylactic HPV vaccination program in China.",0
1348,"BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Inadequate and inequitable access to essential NCD medicines is a major concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. National Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs) are important policy tools that indicate which medicines are prioritized as essential within a country's health system. This study sought to analyze a wide range of national essential medicines lists (EMLs) for their inclusion of priority non communicable disease (NCD) interventions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). METHODS: Three lists of WHO endorsed priority NCD interventions were included. A database with 137 national EMLs and the WHO EML was created from the WHO Repository and these EMLs were compared for listing of priority NCD interventions. RESULTS: Across 137 countries with national EMLs, the median percentage of 20 Best Buys interventions listed was 90% (IQR 80-95) and 31 Package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions (PEN) interventions listed was 94% (IQR 90-97), of 9 HEARTS interventions was 100% (IQR 89-100), and of the 43 unique interventions across the three priority lists was 88% (IQR 84-93). Less than 80% of the 43 interventions were listed by 22 (16%) countries and less than half of the interventions were listed by 2 countries: Angola (35%) and Cambodia (23%). Interventions listed on the fewest number of national EMLs were: influenza vaccine, HPV vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, cervical cancer chemotherapy, codeine, promethazine, senna, and oxygen. CONCLUSION: Most NCD interventions have been prioritized in national policy in most cases. The majority of priority medicines for NCDs described within key WHO NCD technical packages are listed on nearly all national EMLs across 137 countries of all income levels. Most NCD interventions have been prioritized in national policy in most cases, but in some countries and for select interventions such as the HPV vaccine, prioritization may be reviewed.",0
1349,"AIM: Japan has low rates of cervical cancer screening and Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination. This research examines the effectiveness of a family medicine resident-led, intervention in increasing knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer in middle school-girls and increasing knowledge and intention to have cervical cancer screening in their mothers. METHODS: We utilized a pre-test/post-test intervention design in three rural middle schools with 7(th) grade middle school-girls and their mothers. A school-based activity educated girls about HPV and cervical cancer. A home-based activity utilized a homework assignment for girls and their mothers. Pre/post intervention surveys were completed by the girls and their mothers. Major outcomes included changes in knowledge among girls and mothers and barriers to be screened for cervical cancer among mothers. RESULTS: Sixty-five students and sixty-three mothers completed the study. Two out five mothers were not in compliance with current screening recommendations. Identified barriers included: embarrassment (79%), poor access (56%), fear of having cancer (52%), and cervical cancer screening being an unknown procedure (46%). Forty-four percent of mothers deemed their daughters to be at risk for cervical cancer. Trusted sources of information included: doctors (97%), newspapers/television (89%), government (79%), the Internet (78%), and friends (62%). Student knowledge scores (7-point scale) improved significantly from pre- to post-intervention (4.8 vs. 5.9, p < 0.001). Knowledge scores (14-point scale) among mothers also significantly improved (11.7 vs. 12.0, p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a community-based intervention on a sensitive topic by family medicine residents can be implemented in middle schools, can improve school-girls' knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer, and can reach their mothers. Additional research could examine whether those intending to be screened receive screening and how to reach women who still resist screening.",0
1350,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the level of knowledge of cervical cancer among Bangladeshi women and to assess their willingness to receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted from July to December 2011 in one urban and one rural area of Bangladesh. A total of 2037 ever-married women, aged 14 to 64 years, were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Data on socio-demographic characteristics and knowledge of cervical cancer were collected. Willingness to receive the HPV vaccine was assessed. Univariate analyses were completed using quantitative data collected. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to identify factors associated with having heard of cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine. RESULTS: The majority of study participants reported to have heard of cervical cancer (urban: 89.7%, rural 93.4%; P = 0.003). The odds of having heard of cervical cancer were significantly higher in urban women aged 35-44 years (aOR: 2.92 (1.34-6.33) and rural women aged 25-34 years (aOR: 2.90 (1.24-6.73) compared to those aged less than 24 years. Very few women reported to have detailed knowledge on risk factors (urban:9.1%, rural: 8.8%) and prevention (urban: 6.4%, rural: 4.4%) of cervical cancer. In our sample, one in five urban women and one in twenty rural women heard about a vaccine that can prevent cervical cancer. Among urban women, secondary education or higher (aOR: 3.48, 95% CI: 1.67-7.25), age of 20 years and above at marriage (aOR: 2.83, 95% CI: 1.61-5.00), and high socioeconomic status (aOR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.28-3.95) were factors associated with having heard of the HPV vaccine. Willingness to receive the HPV vaccine among study participants either for themselves (urban: 93.9%, rural: 99.4%) or for their daughters (urban: 91.8%, rural: 99.2%) was high. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed knowledge of cervical cancer among Bangladeshi women was found to be poor. Education on cervical cancer must include information on symptoms, risk factors, and preventive methods. Despite poor knowledge, the study population was willing to receive the HPV vaccine.",0
1351,"BACKGROUND: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) -associated cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in women worldwide but it is the most frequent gynaecological cancer and cancer associated death in India women. The objective of this study was to assess knowledge about cervical cancer, HPV, HPV vaccine, HPV vaccine acceptance among school and undergraduates students and their parent's perception about acceptance of HPV vaccine in Northern part of India (Delhi and NCR regions). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative questionnaire based survey among 2500 urban/rural students aged 12-22 years was conducted. RESULTS: Overall, a low frequency (15%) of HPV and cervical cancer awareness was observed in students and their parents. However, the awareness was much higher in females belonging to urban setup compared to boys with a perception that HPV causes cervical cancer in women only. Additionally, only (13%) participants who were aware of cervical cancer and HPV) were willing to accept HPV vaccination. Apparently, parents of female students were two times more willing to accept HPV vaccination for their ward than male students (p<0.001; OR 95%CI = 2.09 (1.58-2.76). CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer and HPV awareness among school, undergraduate students and also to their parents was found to be very low in this part of India. The level of awareness and education appears to be insignificant determinants in rural compared to urban setup. Better health education will be needed to maximize public awareness for cervical cancer prevention.",0
1352,"BACKGROUND: Despite national recommendations, as of 2009 human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates were low with < 30% of adolescent girls fully vaccinated. Research on barriers to vaccination has focused separately on parents, adolescents, or clinicians and not on the decision making process among all participants at the point of care. By incorporating three distinct perspectives, we sought to generate hypotheses to inform interventions to increase vaccine receipt. METHODS: Between March and June, 2010, we conducted qualitative interviews with 20 adolescent-mother-clinician triads (60 individual interviews) directly after a preventive visit with the initial HPV vaccine due. Interviews followed a guide based on published HPV literature, involved 9 practices, and continued until saturation of the primary themes was achieved. Purposive sampling balanced adolescent ages and practice type (urban resident teaching versus non-teaching). Using a modified grounded theory approach, we analyzed data with NVivo8 software both within and across triads to generate primary themes. RESULTS: The study population was comprised of 20 mothers (12 Black, 9 < high school diploma), 20 adolescents (ten 11-12 years old), and 20 clinicians (16 female). Nine adolescents received the HPV vaccine at the visit, eight of whom were African American. Among the 11 not vaccinated, all either concurrently received or were already up-to-date on Tdap and MCV4. We did not observe systematic patterns of vaccine acceptance or refusal based on adolescent age or years of clinician experience. We identified 3 themes: (1) Parents delayed, rather than refused vaccination, and when they expressed reluctance, clinicians were hesitant to engage them in discussion. (2) Clinicians used one of two strategies to present the HPV vaccine, either presenting it as a routine vaccine with no additional information or presenting it as optional and highlighting risks and benefits. (3) Teens considered themselves passive participants in decision making, even when parents and clinicians reported including them in the process. CONCLUSIONS: Programs to improve HPV vaccine delivery in primary care should focus on promoting effective parent-clinician communication. Research is needed to evaluate strategies to help clinicians engage reluctant parents and passive teens in discussion and measure the impact of distinct clinician decision making approaches on HPV vaccine delivery.",0
1353,"Introduction: The incidence of cervical cancer in Appalachia exceeds the national rate; rural Appalachian women are at especially high risk. We assessed the attitudes and practices related to human papillomavirus vaccination among providers in primary care practices in a contiguous 5-county area of Appalachian Pennsylvania.Methods: In December 2006 and May 2007, all family medicine, pediatric, and gynecology practices (n = 65) in the study area were surveyed by 2 faxed survey instruments.Results: Of the 65 practices, 55 completed the first survey instrument. Of these 55, 44 offered the vaccine to their patients. Forty of the 44 practices offered it to girls and women aged 9 to 26 years, and 11 were willing to accept referrals from other practices for vaccination. The average reported charge for each of the 3 required injections was $150. Of the 55 practices that responded to the first survey instrument, 49 responded to the second survey instrument, 46 of which recommended the vaccine to their patients.Conclusion: The prevalence of offering the vaccine against human papillomavirus was high in this area of Appalachian Pennsylvania. Future interventions may focus on community education because the vaccine is available from most providers.",0
1354,"OBJECTIVE: Few data are available on the epidemiology of HPV and cervical cancer among Chinese women younger than 25 years old. This study aimed to estimate the HPV infection rate and the prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in women aged 18-25, as well as their knowledge of and attitudes towards HPV vaccination. METHODS: A population-based cervical cancer screening study was conducted on women aged 18-25 in Jiangsu province in 2008. Participants provided socio-demographic, reproductive and behavioral information and completed a survey about their knowledge of and attitudes towards HPV vaccination. Women then underwent a gynecologic exam to provide two cervical exfoliated cell samples for high risk HPV DNA testing and liquid-based cytology (LBC) as well as visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Women testing positive for any test were referred to colposcopy and biopsy. The gold standard for diagnosis of cervical lesions was directed or random biopsies. RESULTS: Within the sample of 316 women, 3.4% of them were diagnosed with CIN grade 2 or worse lesions and 17.1% were found to be positive for HPV DNA. Among these young women, extra-marital sexual behavior of them (OR=2.0, 95%CI: 1.1-3.8) or their husbands (OR=2.6, 95%: 1.4-4.7) were associated with an increased risk of HPV positivity. Although overall HPV awareness was low, after a brief educational intervention, 98.4% reported they would electively receive HPV vaccination and would also recommend that their daughters be vaccinated. However, most urban and rural women reported their ideal maximum out-of-pocket contribution for HPV vaccination to be less than 500 RMB and 50-100 RMB, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates cervical disease burden is relatively high among sampled Chinese women aged 18-25. Appropriate educational interventions for female adolescents and strategies to subsidize vaccine costs are definitely needed to ensure the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns in China.",0
1355,"BACKGROUND: Limited data suggested that the prevalence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) among female sex workers (FSW) is much higher than in the general female population. The current study aimed to examine the HPV and cervical cancer related awareness, knowledge, and behaviors among FSW in China. METHODS: A total of 360 FSW recruited from entertainment establishments in Beijing completed a self-administered survey including demographics, HPV related knowledge, and health-seeking and cervical cancer preventive behaviors. RESULTS: Approximately 70.8% of the participants ever heard of cervical cancer, and as few as 22.1% and 13.3% ever heard of HPV and HPV vaccine, respectively. The mean score on a 7-item knowledge scale was 2.2 (SD = 2.4). Less than 10% of FSW perceived any risk of cervical cancer, and only 15.3% ever had a Pap smear. About 40.8% of FSW would accept HPV vaccine if it is free, and 21.8% would accept it even with a charge. Multivariate regression suggested that women with better knowledge of cervical cancer were more likely to have a Pap smear (aOR = 1.35); women who had tested for HIV were 11 times more likely to have a Pap smear, and women who had worked longer in commercial sex (aOR = 1.01) and had regular health check-ups (aOR = 1.95) were more likely to accept HPV vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the needs for effective cervical cancer prevention programs for FSW in China and other resource-limited countries. We specifically call for cervical cancer and HPV knowledge and awareness programs and regular screening as well as HPV risk-reduction programs for these vulnerable women.",0
1356,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is recommended in early adolescence. While limited data suggest that patients frequently delay initiation of the three-dose series, age-based variability in initiation of HPV vaccination and its clinical relevance are not well described. Thus, this study aims to characterize HPV vaccination delay among adolescent and young adult females. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined age at HPV vaccination initiation and missed opportunities for receipt of the first vaccine dose (HPV1) among 11-26 year-old females (n=22,900) receiving care at 16 urban academically-affiliated ambulatory care clinics between 2007 and 2011. Predictors of timely vaccination and post-licensure trends in age at HPV1 receipt were assessed using multivariable logistic regression and a generalized linear mixed model, respectively. Chlamydia trachomatis and Papanicolaou screening before HPV vaccination initiation, as markers of prior sexual experience and associated morbidity, were examined in a subcohort of subjects (n=15,049). RESULTS: The proportion of 11-12 year-olds who initiated HPV vaccination increased over time (44.4% [2007] vs. 74.5% [2011], p<0.01). Initiation rates also improved among 13-26 year-olds. Thus, the mean age at HPV1 receipt remained unchanged between 2007 and 2011 (16.0 ± 2.7 vs. 15.9 ± 4.0 years, p=0.45). Spanish language was a positive predictor (AOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.05-2.48) of HPV vaccination initiation among 11-12 year-olds in 2011. The majority (70.8-76.4%) of unvaccinated subjects experienced missed vaccination opportunities. Of the subcohort, 36.9% underwent Chlamydia screening before HPV1 receipt (19.1% with ≥ 1 positive result). Of those with prior Papanicolaou screening (16.6%), 32.1% had ≥ 1 abnormal result. CONCLUSIONS: These low-income, minority females frequently delayed initiation of HPV vaccination. Many had evidence of prior sexual experience and associated morbidity, placing them at risk of HPV-related complications. Promoting timely HPV vaccination and reducing missed vaccination opportunities are crucial.",0
1357,"BACKGROUND: In France, there are recommendations and reimbursements for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination but no HPV vaccination programs. Therefore, vaccination is largely determined by parents' initiative, which can lead to inequalities. The objective of this study was to determine the factors associated with poorer vaccination coverage rates in the most populated region of France. METHODS: The data of this study were obtained from the National Health Insurance between 2011 and 2013. Correlations between vaccination initiation rate (at least 1 dose reimbursed) and socio-demographic/cultural factors were assessed using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient. Multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression. RESULTS: In total, 121,636 girls received at least one HPV vaccine dose. The vaccination rate for girls born from 1996 to 1999 was 18.7%. Disparities in vaccination coverage rates were observed between the 8 departments of the region, ranging from 12.9% to 22.6%. At the department level, unemployment, proportion of immigrants and foreigners, and coverage by CMU health insurance (""Couverture Maladie Universelle"", a health insurance plan for those who are not otherwise covered through business or employment and who have a low income) were significantly inversely correlated with vaccination rates, whereas urban residence, medical density, income and use of medical services were not related to coverage. In the multivariate model, only the percentage of foreigners remained independently associated with lower vaccination coverage. At the individual level, the use of medical services was a strong driver of HPV vaccination initiation. CONCLUSION: We observed geographic disparities in HPV vaccination initiation coverage. Even if no clear factor was identified as a vaccination determinant, we observed a failure of vaccination only based on parents' initiative. Therefore, an organized policy on HPV vaccination, such as school-based programs, can help improve coverage rates.",0
1358,"BACKGROUND: This study is the first to examine associations between several area-based socioeconomic factors and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake among boys in the United States (U.S.). METHODS: Data from the 2012-2013 National Immunization Survey-Teen restricted-use data were analyzed to examine associations of HPV vaccination initiation (receipt of ≥1 dose) and series completion (receipt of three doses) among boys aged 13-17 years (N = 19,518) with several individual-level and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) census measures. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of HPV vaccination initiation and series completion separately. RESULTS: In 2012-2013 approximately 27.9% (95% CI 26.6%-29.2%) of boys initiated and 10.38% (95% CI 9.48%-11.29%) completed the HPV vaccine series. Area-based poverty was not statistically significantly associated with HPV vaccination initiation. It was, however, associated with series completion, with boys living in high-poverty areas (≥20% of residents living below poverty) having higher odds of completing the series (AOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.48) than boys in low-poverty areas (0-4.99%). Interactions between race/ethnicity and ZIP code-level poverty indicated that Hispanic boys living in high-poverty areas had a statistically significantly higher odds of  HPV vaccine initiation (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03-1.97) and series completion (AOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.05-2.32)  than Hispanic boys in  low-poverty areas. Non-Hispanic Black boys in high poverty areas had higher odds of initiation (AOR 2.23, 95% CI 1.33-3.75) and completion (AOR 2.61, 95% CI 1.06-6.44) than non-Hispanic Black boys in low-poverty areas. Rural/urban residence and population density were also significant factors, with boys from urban or densely populated areas having higher odds of initiation and completion compared to boys living in non-urban, less densely populated areas. CONCLUSION: Higher HPV vaccination coverage in urban areas and among racial/ethnic minorities in areas with high poverty may be attributable to factors such as vaccine acceptance, health-care practices, and their access to HPV vaccines through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides free vaccines to uninsured and under-insured children. Given the low HPV vaccination rates among boys in the U.S., these results provide important evidence to inform public health interventions to increase HPV vaccination.",0
1359,"OBJECTIVE: Previous intervention research conducted in Appalachian Kentucky resulted in extremely low uptake and adherence to the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among women ages 18-26, despite provision of free vaccine. Because of these findings, the purpose of this qualitative, follow-up study was to elicit health care providers' perspectives on barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination and suggested strategies for improving vaccination rates. DESIGN AND SAMPLE: Researchers conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of eight health care providers (seven nursing professionals, one physician) at the health clinic where the original HPV vaccination intervention took place. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed and authors used a constant-comparative method to analyze the data. RESULTS: Significant themes emerged from the interviews, centering around two primary issues: vaccine uptake and vaccine adherence. Related to uptake, health care providers identified perceived patient barriers and inadequate HPV vaccine education. They also identified the vaccine schedule and clinic-centered communication deficiencies as adherence-related barriers. CONCLUSION: These Appalachian Kentucky health care providers provided important insights into barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccine uptake and adherence that need to be readily addressed in this community. As informed by these providers, several suggestions for improving HPV vaccination, such as more targeted education efforts and patient-centered reminder systems, may be applicable to other nursing professionals working in rural and medically underserved communities.",0
1360,"OBJECTIVE: To design and evaluate pharmacy student-led educational sessions to improve health beliefs about the HPV vaccine in college-aged students. PARTICIPANTS: Students aged 18-26 attending a large, urban university, including 545 respondents to a December 2014 needs assessment survey about HPV-related health beliefs, 131 students participating in educational sessions during 2015-2016 (intervention group), and 369 undergraduate respondents completing the needs assessment survey (control group). METHODS: A needs assessment survey was conducted to inform design and implementation of pharmacy student-led educational sessions. A similar survey was administered to students after attending educational sessions. Health beliefs were compared for the intervention versus control group. RESULTS: The intervention group was less likely to report high perceived barriers to HPV vaccination and more likely to report high perceived benefits and intention to vaccinate (if previously unvaccinated). CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy student-led, health belief-based educational sessions were associated with improved health beliefs about HPV vaccination.",0
1361,"Including dental health providers in human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination could reduce rising rates in HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC). This study assessed Utah dentists' perspectives on providing HPV vaccination education and services in the dental setting. A cross-sectional, 70-item self-administered survey was conducted among a convenience sample of N = 203 practicing Utah dentists. Statistical analyses included Chi Square tests of independence, scaled scores and Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Majority of Utah dentists surveyed perceived that discussing the link between HPV and OPC and recommending the HPV vaccine is within their scope of practice, but not administration of the HPV vaccine. Dentists with >10 minutes of patient education per week were less likely to be concerned about the cultural, social norms or religious ideology of discussing HPV with their patients (p = .024). Rural dentists were more concerned about the safety and liability of the HPV vaccine (p = .011). Good internal consistency was observed survey items regarding barriers and willing to engage in HPV vaccination practices. Dental providers were interested in HPV training and patient education brochures as strategies, but less interested in administering the HPV vaccine. Dental associations support dentists' engagement in HPV education and HPV-OPC prevention. This is the first study in Utah to examine dentists' perspectives on HPV vaccination. Findings have implications for program planning, intervention development, and future research.",0
1362,"BACKGROUND: Peer influence and social networking can change female adolescent and young adult behavior. Peer influence on preferences for male human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has not been documented. The primary aim of this study was to determine if women had preferences about male sexual partner HPV vaccination receipt. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective survey of women 18-26 years of age was conducted at an urban university student health clinic. Education about the two HPV vaccines, cervical cancer and genital warts was provided. Women self-reported their demographic and medical history data, as well as their own preferences for HPV vaccine and their preferences for their male partner HPV vaccine using a 5 point Likert scale. 601 women, mean age of 21.5 years (SD 2.4), participated between 2011 and 2012. Nearly 95% of respondents were heterosexual; condoms and contraceptives were used in over half of the population. Regardless of the woman's vaccination status, women had significantly higher (strongly agree/agree) preferences for the male partner being vaccinated with HPV4 than not caring if he was vaccinated (63.6% vs. 13.1%, p<0.001). This preference was repeated for sexual risk factors and past reproductive medical history. Women who received HPV4 compared to those choosing HPV2 had a significantly lower proportion of preferences for not caring if the male partner was vaccinated (13% vs. 22%, p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Women preferred a HPV vaccinated male partner. Peer messaging might change the male HPV vaccination uptake.",0
1363,"Routine vaccination with three doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for adolescent girls and boys at 11 or 12 years of age; however, vaccine uptake remains suboptimal. To understand the reasons why parents may accept or refuse HPV vaccine for their children at age 11 or 12 years, we conducted a qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents or guardians (n = 45) whose adolescents receive care at an urban, hospital-based primary care practice. Data were analyzed using an iterative thematic approach. We found that many parents expressed high levels of support for HPV vaccine, including a majority who agreed with vaccination at age 11-12 years. Parents recognized that for prevention of consequences of HPV infection, vaccination of their child early in adolescence was desirable conceptually. However, many parents also expressed that in practice, HPV vaccine should be given to adolescents at the onset of sexual activity, a perception that led to preferences to delay administration of HPV vaccine among certain parents. These apparently contradictory views indicate the need for interventions focused on the benefits of vaccination at the recommended ages. Our findings may be useful in providers' discussions with parents about the vaccine, as pediatric and adolescent health care providers have the unique opportunity to educate parents and clarify misconceptions about vaccination.",0
1364,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to identify motivations and barriers to HPV vaccination and culturally relevant and meaningful opportunities for vaccine promotion among African American mothers and adolescent daughters. Qualitative methods were employed to identify barriers to HPV immunization and understand mothers motivations to vaccinate their daughters. We conducted in-depth interviews with 19 mother-daughter pairs focused on 5 key areas: health history, prior vaccine experience, knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccine, relationship with physician, and experience of cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer (CD/CC). RESULTS: Four key factors drive HPV immunization among African-American mothers of adolescent daughters. First, mothers' CD/CC disease experiences motivated a strong commitment to protect daughters from the trauma of CD/CC. Second, limited understanding of HPV and its connection to CD/CC made it difficult for mothers to assess the risk of infection or explain the medical benefits of the vaccine to their daughters. Third, mothers anticipate the sexual debut of adolescent daughters and advocate for healthcare interventions to protect them. Mothers were not deterred by multiple visits to complete the vaccine series; they likened HPV immunization to injectable contraceptives that require a series of injections and offer protection from the unintended consequences of sexual activity. Finally, mothers trusted physicians to initiate discussion of HPV immunization. Physicians who failed to initiate discussion and offer unconditional endorsement generated doubt about the vaccine among mothers and missed opportunities for immunization. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial results indicate that physicians can engage in culturally relevant vaccine promotion in urban, underserved African American communities by initiating discussions of HPV immunization that (1) acknowledge mothers' own CD/CC experiences, (2) support parenting strategies that aim to protect daughters from the unintended consequences of sexual activity, and (3) make explicit the connection between CD/CC and HPV infection, and between prevention of HPV infection and HPV immunization.",0
1365,"Background. Although the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been approved for use in adolescents in the US for over a decade, vaccination uptake remains low. Of concern, HPV vaccine coverage is below the national average in Minnesota, USA. To understand the reach of current HPV programming and research, we use an online media scan; this method may be applied to other jurisdictions to gain insight about various public health issues. Design and Methods. This online media scan describes the nature and scope of ongoing activities to increase HPV vaccination in Minnesota. The media scan included: a) structured internet searches of HPV vaccine health education/promotion activities ongoing in Minnesota since 2013, and b) searches in research databases of the published literature on HPV vaccination in Minnesota from 2013 to 2018. Results. Searches resulted in 880 online and 142 research article matches, with 40 and 36 meeting selection criteria. Results were categorized by activities focusing on race/ethnicity, sex, health providers, parents, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer or questioning (LGBTQ) populations, geographic location, catchup vaccination, and insurance status. Most activities were statewide (52% health education/promotion and 35% research), followed by activities located in entirely urban areas (15% health education/promotion and 41% research) with only 6% of health education/promotion activities and 2% of research activities carried out in entirely rural areas. Conclusions. A range of local and statewide HPV vaccine health education/promotion and research activities were identified in Minnesota. Several efforts partnered with American Indian and Somali/Somali-American communities, but fewer activities focused on HPV vaccination among LGBTQ youth and HPV vaccination in rural areas.",0
1366,"Introduction. The aims of this qualitative study were to explore (a) the factors influencing mothers' decisions to vaccinate 11- to 12-year-old daughters against human papillomavirus (HPV) and (b) the mothers' and daughters' perspectives about HPV vaccine-related decision making. Methods. Participants were girls (N = 33) who had received an HPV vaccine and their mothers (N = 32), recruited from suburban and urban pediatric practices. Semistructured interviews were conducted with girls and mothers separately, and data were analyzed using framework analysis. Results. The primary factors influencing mothers' decisions to vaccinate daughters against HPV were (a) mother's beliefs and experiences; (b) interactions with clinicians, friends, and family members; and (c) exposure to media reports/marketing. Most daughters believed the decision to be vaccinated was a mutual one, although most mothers believed the decision was theirs. Conclusions. This study provides novel insights into perspectives on decision making about HPV vaccination among mothers and 11- to12-year-old daughters, which can be used in interventions to improve vaccination rates.",0
1367,"BACKGROUND: The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), and GBM living with HIV in particular, are disproportionately impacted by HPV-associated cancers. The HPV vaccine, given early enough in life, may markedly reduce the likelihood of such cancers. In Canada, most provincial insurance programs only cover HPV vaccination for GBM up to the age of 26. Our objective was to understand physicians' everyday experiences and challenges in recommending HPV vaccination to older GBM patients. METHODS: As part of the HPV Screening and Vaccine Evaluation (HPV-SAVE) Study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 HIV-positive GBM patients who had received anal cancer screening and 15 service providers, including 13 physicians, who had arranged for anal cancer screening in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia. In this analysis, we draw upon the 13 physician interviews, which were coded following Grounded Theory. RESULTS: Physicians strongly supported the HPV vaccine for all GBM and considered it to be important for the management of HIV-related care. However, the overall support for HPV vaccination among physicians did not translate into consistent recommendation practices. There were two overarching factors that limited the strength/frequency of physicians' vaccine recommendation practices. First, cost/insurance coverage for some older patients impacted if and how the HPV vaccine was discussed. Second, physicians had diverse perspectives on both the prevention and therapeutic benefits of vaccinating older GBM and the reality that national guidelines are incongruent with publicly funded vaccine programs for vaccinating patients over 26 years old. These two interrelated factors have co-produced an apparent economic-evidentiary conundrum for many physicians regarding how and for whom to offer HPV vaccination. CONCLUSION: Economic barriers coupled with evidentiary and guideline gaps have created clinical practice challenges for physicians and has resulted in different messages being communicated to some older GBM patients about how important HPV vaccination is for their health.",0
1368,"BACKGROUND: Since 2011, in the United States, quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been recommended for boys aged 11 to 12 years, men through age 21, and men who have sex with men (MSM) through age 26. We assessed HPV vaccination coverage and factors associated with vaccination among young MSM (YMSM) and transgender women (TGW) in 2 cities. METHODS: During 2012-2014, 808 YMSM and TGW aged 18 to 26 years reported vaccination status in a self-administered computerized questionnaire at 3 sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in Los Angeles and Chicago. Associations with HPV vaccination were assessed using bivariate and multivariable models to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Few of the diverse participants (Hispanic/Latino, 38.0%; white, 27.0%; and black/African American, 17.9%) reported receiving 1 or more HPV vaccine doses (n = 111 [13.7%]) and even fewer reported 3 doses (n = 37 [4.6%]). A multivariable model found associations between vaccination and having a 4-year college degree or higher (aOR, 2.83; CI, 1.55-5.17) and self-reported STDs (aOR, 1.21; CI, 1.03-1.42). In a model including recommendation variables, the strongest predictor of vaccination was a health care provider recommendation (aOR, 11.85; CI, 6.70-20.98). CONCLUSIONS: Human papillomavirus vaccination coverage was low among YMSM and TGW in this 2-US city study. Our findings suggest further efforts are needed to reach YMSM seeking care in STD clinics, increase strong recommendations from health care providers, and integrate HPV vaccination with other clinical services such as STD testing.",0
1369,"INTRODUCTION: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at high risk to contract human papillomavirus (HPV). While an effective vaccination exists, its use among YMSM is markedly lower compared to non-MSM and women. This study compares scaling up HPV vaccination in conjunction with other prevention strategies. METHODS: An agent-based model of urban YMSM (≤26 years of age) reflective of the demography of Philadelphia, PA, simulated for up to ten years of follow-up to examine anal and oral transmission of the HPV genotypes covered in the nonavalent (9v) vaccine: 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58. Starting HPV prevalences ranged from a high of 18% (type 6) to a low of 6% (type 31); overall 65% of individuals carried any HPV genotype. Simulated levels of vaccination were ranged from 0% to 13% (present-day level), 25%, 50%, 80% (Healthy People 2020 target), and 100% in conjunction with condom use and HIV seroadaptive practices. The primary outcome was the relative reduction in HPV infection. RESULTS: Compared to present-day vaccination levels (13%), scaling-up vaccination led to expected declines in 10-year post-simulation HPV prevalence. Anal HPV (any 9v types) declined by 9%, 27%, 46%, and 58% at vaccination levels of 25%, 50%, 80%, and 100%, respectively. Similarly, oral HPV (any 9v types) declined by 11%, 33%, 57%, and 71% across the same levels of vaccine uptake. Comparing the prevention strategies, condoms blocked the greatest number of anal transmissions when vaccination was at or below present-day levels. For oral transmission, vaccination was superior to condom use at all levels of coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Public health HPV preventions strategies should continue to emphasize the complementary roles of condoms and vaccination, especially for preventing oral infection. Improving vaccination coverage will ultimately have the greatest impact on reducing HPV infection among YMSM.",0
1370,"BACKGROUND: Pre-vaccination information on HPV type-specific prevalence in target populations is essential for designing and monitoring immunization strategies for cervical cancer (CC) prevention. Data on HPV prevalence in Italy are available for women over the age of 24 years, target of the population-based CC screening programmes; while data of HPV prevalence in younger ages are very limited. The present study enrolled Italian women aged 18-26 years in order to assess the prevalence and distribution of high-risk (HR) HPV types. Risk-factors correlated with HR-HPV positivity were also described. METHODS: A sample of 2,289 women was randomly selected from the resident population lists of ten Local Health Units (LHUs) located in six Italian Regions scattered across the country; both rural and urban LHUs were involved. Women aged between 18 and 26 years and living in the selected LHUs were included in the study; pregnant women and women who did not speak Italian were excluded. A total of 1,102 women met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate. Participants were offered pap test and Hybrid-Capture 2 (HC2) test for HR-HPV types and genotyping was performed on positive smears. RESULTS: Out of 1,094 valid samples, 205 (18.7%) were HR-HPV positive. Women with 2-4 (ORadj = 4.15, 95%CI: 2.56-6.72) and ≥5 lifetime partners (ORadj = 10.63, 95%CI: 6.16-18.36) and women who have used any contraceptive in the last six months (ORadj = 1.67, 95%CI: 1.09-2.54) had a higher risk to be infected; women living with their partner had a lower risk (ORadj = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.34-0.92) to acquire infection than women living with parents/friends/alone. Among HC2 positive women, HPV16 was the most prevalent type (30.9%), followed by 31 (19.6%), 66 (12.9%), 51 (11.3%), 18 (8.8%), 56 (8.8%). Co-infections of HR-HC2 targeted types were found in 20.4% of positive samples. The HR-HPV prevalence in women with abnormal cytology (52.4%) was significantly higher than in women with normal cytology (14.6%); however 33.0% of HR-HPV infected women had an abnormal cytology. CONCLUSION: HR-HPV prevalence in Italian women aged 18-26 years was 19%, higher than what detected for older women, by other studies using the same molecular method and laboratory network; this result supports the choice of electing girls before the sexual debut as the primary target of HPV vaccination. The HPV type distribution found in this study may represent a baseline picture; an accurate post-vaccine surveillance is necessary to early detect a possible genotype replacement. The high prevalence of viral types other than vaccine-HPV types supports the necessity to guarantee the progression of CC screening programmes in vaccinated women.",0
1371,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this longitudinal study was to identify individual and interpersonal factors associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series completion in a sample of low-income Latina/o adolescent girls and boys. METHODS: Caregiver-adolescent dyads (N = 161) were recruited from a rural Federally Qualified Health Center in southwest Florida when the adolescent (aged 11-17 years) received the first dose of HPV vaccine. Dyads completed a baseline assessment that measured demographic and cultural characteristics, past medical history, provider-patient communication, HPV knowledge, health beliefs about completing the series, and the adolescent's experience receiving the first dose. Using multivariable logistic regression, we identified caregiver- and adolescent-related factors associated with series completion (receipt of three doses of HPV vaccine within 1 year of initiation) as indicated in the adolescent's medical record and state immunization registry. RESULTS: Within 1 year of initiation, 57% (n = 92) completed the three-dose series. Missed opportunities for completion were observed for 20% of the sample who returned to the clinic. Caregiver-related predictors of completion included education, self-efficacy to complete the series, and knowledge of the required number of doses. Adolescent-related predictors included age, influenza vaccination within the past 2 years, having a chronic medical condition, reason for the baseline visit, and receipt of written information about HPV vaccination from a health care provider. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight important opportunities for improving completion of the HPV vaccine series among Latina/o adolescents. Intervention efforts should involve health care providers and parent-adolescent dyads and prioritize evidence-based strategies for reducing missed opportunities for series completion.",0
1372,"BACKGROUND: Although physician recommendation is one of the strongest predictors of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, it is unclear for whom physicians are recommending the vaccine. To help guide intervention efforts, this study investigated predictors of participant-reported physician recommendation for HPV vaccine among young adults in the USA. METHODS: Women and men (N=223) aged 18-26 years were recruited online through Craigslist, a popular classified advertisements website. Ads were posted in the 25 largest US cities from September 2013 to March 2014. Participants completed a survey that assessed demographic and sociopolitical characteristics, sexual history, HPV vaccination history, and whether they had ever received a recommendation for HPV vaccine from a physician or healthcare provider. RESULTS: Fifty-three per cent reported receiving a recommendation for HPV vaccine and 45% had received ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine. Participants who received a recommendation were over 35 times more likely to receive ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine relative to participants without a recommendation. Bivariable and multivariable correlates of provider recommendation were identified. Results from the multivariable model indicated that younger (aged 18-21 years), female, White participants with health insurance (ie, employer-sponsored or some other type such as military-sponsored) were more likely to report receiving a recommendation for HPV vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that physician recommendation practices for HPV vaccination vary by characteristics of the patient. Findings underscore the key role of the healthcare provider in promoting HPV vaccination and have important implications for future HPV vaccine interventions with young adults.",0
1373,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the trend of HPV vaccine initiation and completion among girls in Texas from 2008 to 2010. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) over 3 years (2008-2010). The information regarding HPV vaccination was gathered from the parents of 9- to 17-year-old daughters (choosing only 1 per household) in randomly selected households in the sample area. RESULTS: The highest prevalence of vaccine initiation and completion were detected in 2010 (20.9% and 9.7%, respectively). Over the study period, HPV vaccine initiation statistically significantly increased (2008, 14.9%; 2009, 20.7%; 2010, 24.3%; p = 0.002), corresponding to an annual increase in coverage of 33.5% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.60). Similarly, HPV vaccination completion increased (2008, 6.3%; 2009, 9.6%; 2010, 11.6%; p = 0.021), corresponding to an annual increase in coverage of 37.1% (OR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.05-1.79). Increasing trends in HPV vaccination initiation and completion were observed in mothers, white, non-Hispanic parents, parents who had attended some college or were college graduates, parents who were married/partnered, and parents who lived in urban areas. CONCLUSION: Although HPV vaccination coverage in Texas is lower than recommended, there have been increases in the trends of vaccine initiation and completion. The campaigns promoting HPV vaccination should target specific population groups in which HPV immunization rates did not increase over time.",0
1374,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) induce condylomata, anogenital cancers and their precursor lesions as anal or penile intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN/PIN). HIV-positive individuals have an increased risk for the development of anogenital HPV-induced lesions. OBJECTIVE: Estimation of the prevalence of HPV-related anogenital benign and malignant lesions in HIV-infected men attending a screening programme. METHODS: Four hundred HIV-positive men [98% men who have sex with men (MSM)] were enrolled in this prospective study from 2008 to 2011. All patients received an inspection of the anogenital region, digital rectal examination, high-resolution anoscopy (HRA), anal cytology, anal/penile histology if required, and HPV-typing of anal and penile swabs. RESULTS: At baseline, 75% (n = 302) of the men had abnormal anal cytological/histological results. 41% presented with low-grade (n = 164), 24% with high-grade anal dysplasia (n = 95) and two men with invasive anal cancer. 2.3% had PIN (n = 9) and one patient had penile cancer at baseline. Throughout the study period, 75% had anal dysplasia (low-grade n = 177, high-grade n = 125), 3.3% (n = 13) had PIN and two further patients developed anal cancer. Within the study period, 52.8% (n = 211) had condylomata (49% anal, 15% penile, 11% anal plus penile condylomata). At baseline, 88.5% of anal and 39.3% of penile swabs were HPV-DNA positive, and 77.8% of anal and 26.5% of penile swabs carried high-risk HPV-types. HPV16 was the most frequent HPV-type. CONCLUSION: HIV-positive MSM have a high risk for HPV-induced condylomata, (pre)malignant anogenital lesions and anogenital cancers. Screening for HPV-induced dysplasia is crucial to avoid progression to invasive carcinomas. Additionally, HPV-vaccination recommendations should be extended to high-risk populations.",0
1375,"OBJECTIVE: Healthcare providers (HCPs) are advised to give all parents a strong recommendation for HPV vaccination. However, it is possible that strong recommendations could be less effective at promoting vaccination among African Americans who on average have greater mistrust in the healthcare system. This study examines the associations of parental trust in HCPs and strength of HCP vaccination recommendation on HPV vaccine acceptance among African American parents. METHODS: Participants were recruited from an urban, academic medical center between July 2012 and July 2014. We surveyed 400 African American parents of children ages 10-12years who were offered HPV vaccine by their HCPs to assess sociodemographic factors, vaccine beliefs, trust in HCPs, and the HPV vaccine recommendation received. Medical records were reviewed to determine vaccination receipt. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, children whose parents were ""very strongly"" recommended the HPV vaccine had over four times higher odds of vaccine receipt compared with those whose parents were ""not very strongly"" recommended the vaccine. Having a parent with ""a lot of"" versus ""none"" or only ""some"" trust in HCPs was associated with over twice the odds of receiving HPV vaccine. Very strong HCP recommendations were associated with higher odds of vaccination among all subgroups, including those with more negative baseline attitudes toward HPV vaccine and those with lower levels of trust. Adding the variables strength of HCP recommendation and parental trust in HCPs to a multivariable model already adjusted for sociodemographic factors and parental vaccine beliefs improved the pseudo R2 from 0.52 to 0.55. CONCLUSIONS: Among participants, receiving a strong vaccine recommendation and having a higher level of trust in HCPs were associated with higher odds of HPV vaccination, but did not add much to the predictive value of a model that already adjusted for baseline personal beliefs and sociodemographic factors.",0
1376,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer claims the lives of 275,000 women each year; most of these deaths occur in low-or middle-income countries. In Kenya, cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women of reproductive age. Kenya's Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation has developed a comprehensive strategy to prevent cervical cancer, which includes plans for vaccinating preteen girls against human papillomavirus (HPV) by 2015. To identify HPV vaccine communication and mobilization needs, this research sought to understand HPV vaccine-related perceptions and concerns of male and female caregivers and community leaders in four rural communities of western Kenya. METHODS: We conducted five focus groups with caregivers (n = 56) and 12 key-informant interviews with opinion leaders to explore cervical cancer-related knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, as well as acceptability of HPV vaccination for 9-12 year-old girls. Four researchers independently reviewed the data and developed codes based on questions in interview guides and topics that emerged organically, before comparing and reconciling results through a group consensus process. RESULTS: Cervical cancer was not commonly recognized, though it was understood generally in terms of its symptoms. By association with cancer and genital/reproductive organs, cervical cancer was feared and stigmatized. Overall acceptability of a vaccine that prevents cervical cancer was high, so long as it was endorsed by trusted agencies and communities were sensitized first. Some concerns emerged related to vaccine safety (e.g., impact on fertility), program intent, and health equity. CONCLUSION: For successful vaccine introduction in Kenya, there is a need for communication and mobilization efforts to raise cervical cancer awareness; prompt demand for vaccination; address health equity concerns and stigma; and minimize potential resistance. Visible endorsement by government leaders and community influencers can provide reassurance of the vaccine's safety, efficacy and benefits for girls and communities. Involvement of community leadership, parents and champions may also be critical for combatting stigma and making cervical cancer relevant to Kenyan communities. These findings underscore the need for adequate planning and resources for information, education and communication prior to vaccine introduction. Specific recommendations for communication and social-marketing strategies are made.",0
1377,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination is the primary strategy to reduce the burden of human papillomavirus (HPV) related diseases in the United States. Unvaccinated youth are at risk for HPV infection and associated diseases, and limited research has explored factors associated with HPV vaccination among those who are disadvantaged and at high risk, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer and/or homeless. METHODS: A retrospective electronic medical record review was conducted at an urban, homeless, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer focused health center in northeastern US logistic regression models examined the associations between HPV vaccination and demographic/social characteristics and health behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 1211 men and 1326 women (gender at birth) records were reviewed from patients (ages 13-26 years) who presented for care between January 2010 and June 2013. The sample was diverse, and about half identified as heterosexual and reported stable/secure housing. Approximately 8% of men and 29% of women had obtained ≥ 1 HPV vaccine dose. The strongest predictors of vaccine initiation were health-related behaviors: having an annual examination, obtaining a non-HPV vaccine, and engaging in oral sex. Additionally, for women only, having had a Pap test or a sexually transmitted infection visit were also associated with an increase in odds, whereas identifying as transmale decreased the odds of vaccination. Having private insurance was the only predictor of 3-dose completion (women only). CONCLUSIONS: Among a high-risk adolescent sample, primarily health-seeking behaviors increased the odds of HPV vaccination, reinforcing the importance of providers using various routine preventative visits as opportunities/cues to vaccine.",0
1378,"OBJECTIVE: Hispanic women in Texas have among the highest rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the country. Increasing regular Papanicolaou test screening and HPV vaccination are crucial to reduce the burden of cervical cancer among Hispanics. This paper presents lessons learned from community-based cervical cancer control programs for Hispanics and highlights effective intervention programs, methods and strategies. METHODS: We reviewed and summarized cervical cancer control efforts targeting Hispanic women, focusing on interventions developed by researchers at the University of Texas, School of Public Health. We identified commonalities across programs, highlighted effective methods, and summarized lessons learned to help guide future intervention efforts. RESULTS: Community-academic partnerships were fundamental in all steps of program development and implementation. Programs reviewed addressed psychosocial, cultural, and access barriers to cervical cancer control among low-income Hispanic women. Intervention approaches included lay health worker (LHW) and navigation models and used print media, interactive tailored media, photonovellas, client reminders, one-on-one and group education sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Small media materials combined with LHW and navigation approaches were effective in delivering Pap test screening and HPV vaccination messages and in linking women to services. Common theoretical methods included in these approaches were modeling, verbal persuasion, and facilitating access. Adaptation of programs to an urban environment revealed that intensive navigation was needed to link women with multiple access barriers to health services. Collectively, this review reveals 1) the importance of using a systematic approach for planning and adapting cervical cancer control programs; 2) advantages of collaborative academic-community partnerships to develop feasible interventions with broad reach; 3) the use of small media and LHW approaches and the need for tailored phone navigation in urban settings; and 4) coordination and technical assistance of community-based efforts as a way to maximize resources.",0
1379,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite national recommendations for adolescent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, rates have lagged behind those of other adolescent vaccines. We implemented interventions and examined rates of vaccination coverage in a large, urban, safety net health care system to understand whether our tactics for achieving high rates of adolescent vaccination were successful. METHODS: Denver Health is an integrated urban safety net health system serving >17 000 adolescents annually. The process for achieving high vaccination rates in our health system includes ""bundling"" of vaccines, offering vaccines at every visit, and standard orders. Data from vaccine registry and utilization statistics were used to determine vaccination rates in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years from 2004 to 2014, and these findings were compared with state and national rates for 2013. Regression analysis was used to identify characteristics associated with vaccination. RESULTS: In 2013 (N = 11 463), HPV coverage of ≥1 dose was 89.8% (female subjects) and 89.3% (male subjects), compared with national rates of 57.3% and 34.6%. Rates of HPV coverage (≥3 doses) were 66.0% for female subjects and 52.5% for male subjects, versus 37.6% and 13.9% nationally. For both sexes, tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis, adsorbed, vaccine coverage was 95.9% (86.0% nationally), and meningococcal conjugate vaccine coverage was 93.5% (77.8% nationally). Female subjects, Hispanic subjects, non-English speakers, and teenagers <200% below the federal poverty level were more likely to have received 3 doses of HPV. CONCLUSIONS: Through low-cost, system-wide standard procedures, Denver Health achieved adolescent vaccination rates well above national coverage rates. Avoiding missed opportunities for vaccination and normalizing the HPV vaccine were key procedures that contributed to high coverage rates.",0
1380,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) epidemiological research has generally been individual based, typically focusing on women, with couple-based research mostly consisting of cross-sectional assessment of prevalent HPV infection in both partners. OBJECTIVE: The HPV Infection and Transmission among Couples through Heterosexual activity (HITCH) study was set up to investigate the transmissibility of HPV among young, recently formed couples in Montreal, Canada. This paper provides an overview of the HITCH cohort study design and procedures as well as a narrative summary of the most important findings. METHODS: HITCH is a longitudinal investigation of HPV transmission in recently formed heterosexual partnerships initiated within 6-month pre-enrollment, a time at which considerable transmission is believed to occur. A total of 549 newly formed dyads were recruited (2005-2011) from postsecondary institutions, including 502 young women and their male partners. An additional 46 males were enrolled at follow-up, as some women enrolled a subsequent partner at follow-up. Women aged 18-24 years were followed for 24 months for acquisition of HPV types not present at enrollment, whereas men returned for a single follow-up visit at month 4, for a sum total of 3361 clinic visits. The last follow-up visit occurred in January 2014. Extensive sociodemographic, sexual behavioral, and medical history data were collected every 2-4 months using computer-assisted, self-administered questionnaires. Furthermore, participants provided genital, blood, oral, and hand specimens for HPV assessment. RESULTS: Although in its early analysis stage, HITCH has produced important publications. Findings from HITCH have increased the available knowledge about the natural history of HPV transmission and its determinants, provided further evidence regarding oral-oral and oral-genital routes of HPV transmission, and supplied empirically valid epidemiological parameters of HPV transmission to assist mathematical modelers in health economic assessments. In addition, HITCH data were made available to several multistudy collaborations evaluating new HPV detection assays and evidence for-or-against HPV type replacement following the introduction of HPV vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: HITCH will continue to offer a unique resource for research on HPV transmission. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR1-10.2196/11284.",0
1381,"BACKGROUND: Opportunistic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for men who have sex with men (MSM) was piloted in sexual health clinics (SHC) in England between 2016 and 2018. AIM: to evaluate the pilot's first year (April 2016-March 2017) in terms of feasibility, acceptability, uptake, impact and equity and interpret the outcome in the context of wide HPV vaccination policy. METHODS: Attendance and uptake data from routine SHC surveillance datasets and a cross-sectional survey administered to individuals receiving the vaccine were analysed. RESULTS: Among 18,875 eligible MSM, 8,580 (45.5%) were recorded as having received one HPV vaccine dose, decreasing slightly with increasing age, and uptake was higher in rural than urban areas. Survey results suggested that of those receiving the first dose of HPV vaccine, 8% were new attendees and that among those, less than 11% attended just to receive the vaccine. Of those having their first HPV vaccination, 95% indicated they would like to receive the next vaccine doses at the same clinic and 85% of patients reported accessing other services when visiting SHC for the first dose of vaccine. CONCLUSION: An opportunistic HPV vaccination programme for MSM can be delivered in an acceptable and, as far as can be evaluated, equitable manner, without major disruption to SHC and HIV clinics.",0
1382,"CONTEXT: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices has recommended human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines for use in children and young adults for preventing HPV-related diseases, but HPV vaccine coverage is low in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To assess HPV vaccination among US adults and children and to identify characteristics associated with HPV vaccination. METHODS: We used the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System data to examine HPV vaccine initiation and completion among adults aged 18 to 26 years and children aged 9 to 17 years in 5 US states. We performed a multivariate logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with HPV vaccination. RESULTS: We assessed the HPV vaccination status of 706 women and 560 men and 2201 girls and 2292 boys. In 2010, a total of 258 (41.6%) women and 21 (4.3%) men had initiated HPV vaccination. Of those vaccinated women, 182 (75%) completed the 3-dose vaccine series. Rural residence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.37) and not having a Papanicolaou test (aOR = 0.44) were negatively associated with HPV vaccine initiation among women. Women who were aged 18 to 20 years (aOR = 2.93) were more likely to complete HPV vaccination. A total of 612 (24.6%) girls and 86 (5.2%) boys received 1 or more doses of HPV vaccines; 308 (50.3%) vaccinated girls and 14 (10.8%) vaccinated boys completed the vaccine series. Younger age (9-12 years: aOR = 0.09) and not receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine (aOR = 0.44) were negatively related to HPV vaccine initiation in girls. Girls were less likely to initiate and complete HPV vaccination if their parents did not have a routine checkup within 1 year. CONCLUSION: HPV vaccination in the United States remains below the Healthy People 2020 objective (80%). To increase HPV vaccination, strategies still need to focus on improving access to HPV vaccines and utilization of health services.",0
1383,"BACKGROUND: Implementation of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination raised concerns that vaccination could lead to riskier sexual behavior. This study explored how possible differences in sexual behavior and HPV knowledge developed over time between HPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated girls. METHODS: A random sample of 19,939 girls (16-17 year olds) eligible for the catch-up HPV vaccination campaign in the Netherlands was invited for a longitudinal study with questionnaires every 6 months over a two-year follow-up period. Possible differences over time between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were studied using generalized equations estimation (GEE). RESULTS: A total of 2989 girls participated in round one, of which 1574 participated (52.7%) in the final 5th round. Vaccinated girls were more likely to live in more urban areas (OR 1.28, 95%CI 1.10-1.47) and to use alcohol (OR 1.46, 95%CI 1.24-1.70) and contraceptives (OR 1.69, 95%CI 1.45-1.97). Vaccinated and unvaccinated girls showed comparable knowledge on HPV, HPV vaccination, and transmission. Vaccinated girls were more likely to be sexually active (OR 1.19, 95%CI 1.02-1.39), and this difference increased over time (OR for interaction 1.06, 95%CI 1.00-1.12). However, they had a slightly lower number of lifetime sexual partners (mean difference - 0.20, 95%CI -0.41-0.00). Vaccinated girls were less likely to use a condom with a steady partner (aOR 0.71, 95%CI 0.56-0.89). However, the difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated girls with regard to condom use with casual or steady partner(s) did not significantly change over time. CONCLUSION: Overall, we did not find indications that vaccination influenced sexual behavior in girls during 2 years of follow-up. The few differences found may be related to existing disparities in the socio-demographic characteristics of the young population pointing to the importance and improvement of education with regard to safe sex practices. Our findings do not suggest that vaccination status is associated with changes in sexual risk behavior and thus it is unlikely that this might influence the effectiveness of the vaccination program.",0
1384,"Background: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) leads to serious health issues and remains the most common sexually transmitted infection. Despite availability of effective vaccines, HPV vaccination rates are suboptimal. Furthermore, providers recommend the HPV vaccine less than half the time for eligible patients. Prior informatics research has demonstrated the effectiveness of computer-based clinical decision support (CDS) in changing provider behavior, especially in the area of preventative services.Methods: Following a randomized clinical trial to test the effect of a CDS intervention on HPV vaccination rates, we conducted semi-structured interviews with health care providers to understand whether they noticed the CDS reminders and why providers did or did not respond to the prompts. Eighteen providers, a mix of medical doctors and nurse practitioners, were interviewed from five publicly-funded, urban health clinics. Interview data were qualitatively analyzed by two independent researchers using inductive content analysis.Results: While most providers recalled seeing the CDS reminders, few of them perceived the intervention as effective in changing their behavior. Providers stated many reasons for why they did not perceive a change in their behavior, yet the results of the trial showed HPV vaccination rates increased as a result of the intervention.Conclusions: CDS reminders may be effective at changing provider behavior even if providers perceive them to be of little use.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02551887 Registered on September 15, 2015.",0
1385,"INTRODUCTION: HPV vaccine uptake is lowest among young adults. Little is known about the most effective way to decrease missed opportunities (MO) and increase uptake of the vaccine in this vulnerable population. OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of a clinical intervention bundle on the rate of MO and uptake of the vaccine among young adult women. METHODS: From 2/2014 to 7/2015, an intervention bundle (designating physician and nurse champions, pre-screening patients' charts, empowering nurses to recommend immunization, providing no-cost vaccinations, placing prompts in clinic note templates, eliminating requirement for pre-vaccination pregnancy test) was implemented at an urban, hospital-based OB/GYN clinic. Medical records were reviewed for all vaccine-eligible (non-pregnant, 11-26 years) women seen between 2/2013 and 9/2016. Impact of the bundled interventions on the monthly rates of MO and vaccine uptake was estimated by analyzing immunization trends with an interrupted time-series model using counterfactual comparison groups in order to control for pre-existing trends. RESULTS: There were 6,463 vaccine-eligible visits during our study period. The prevalence of women who had both completed and initiated the series was significantly higher, 20.3% and 29.7% respectively, in the last month, compared to their counterfactuals (p < 0.01). In the last study month, the rate of MO was significantly lower than its counterfactual (19.73 per 100 encounters lower, p < 0.01). Hispanic women had attributable reductions in their rates of MO that were twice that of White women. Statistically significant attributable reductions were also seen among Spanish speakers, publicly insured, and uninsured women. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of this intervention bundle effectively reduced the monthly rate of MO and increased the prevalence of women who had initiated and completed the HPV vaccine series. The reduction of MO was most drastic among Hispanic, publicly insured and uninsured women compared to White and privately insured.",0
1386,"Background:Cervical cancer is the second commonest cancer amongst Sri Lankan women. With introduction of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to the national immunisation schedule, awareness and prevention of disease underpins vaccine uptake. Knowledge of HPV, HPV-related diseases and attitudes towards prevention and screening among urban women was assessed. Methods:Primigravids attending Colombo North Teaching Hospital antenatal clinics were recruited over 8 months as surrogates for women who have recently become sexually active. Data through a self-administered questionnaire on three domains were collected (cervical cancer, Pap testing, HPV and vaccine). Results:Of 667 participants (mean age 23.9 (s.d. = 4.4) years, 68.0% (n = 454) had >11 years of schooling), only 1.5% (n = 10) were aware of all three domains: 55.0% (370/667) had heard of cervical cancer, 19.0% of whom (70/370) knew it was sexually acquired, 9.0% (60/667) were aware of Pap screening, while 5.4% (36/665) had heard about HPV and <1.0% (5/667) knew it caused cancer. The total knowledge score ranged from zero (379/665) to nine (2/665), with a mean of 0.9 (s.d. - 1.4), with awareness increasing with level of education (χ2 = 18.6; P <0.001). Of those aware of Pap testing, 8.0% (5/60) were reluctant to undergo testing, while 46.6% (28/60) had no apprehension. Conclusions:Knowledge of cervical cancer, Pap testing, HPV and vaccine was low, especially in terms of HPV. Among those aware of Pap screening, generally there were favourable attitudes to having a test. These data have implications for acceptance of the vaccine and any future expansion of cervical screening with newer, more cost-effective technologies.",0
1387,"Although screening for pre-cancerous cervical lesions and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination are accepted and effective means to prevent cervical cancer, women in Mali have limited access to these interventions. In addition, cervical cancer prevention by HPV vaccination has been controversial in some settings. To reduce cervical cancer prevalence and increase HPV vaccine uptake, it is important to understand the level of knowledge about cervical cancer screening and practices related to vaccination in at-risk populations. In this study, the level of knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer and attitudes towards vaccination were assessed among 301 participants (male and female, adults and adolescents) in a house-to-house survey in two urban neighborhoods in Bamako, Mali. The survey was combined with a brief educational session on HPV. Prior to the education session, overall knowledge of HPV infection and cervical cancer was very low: only 8% knew that HPV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Less than 20% of women had ever consulted a gynecologist and less than 3% had ever had cervical cancer screening. After hearing a description of HPV vaccine, more than 80% would accept HPV vaccination; fathers and husbands were identified as primary decisions makers and local clinics or the home as preferred sites for vaccination. This study provides information on STI knowledge and vaccine acceptance in Bamako, Mali in 2012, prior to the introduction of HPV vaccination.",0
1388,"OBJECTIVE: In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil® (Merck) for girls and women aged 9-26 years. Although the vaccine is ideally administered to 11 and 12 year olds, college-aged women may be uniquely at risk for HPV due to high rates of sexual activity and, thus, serve as an important catch-up population for the HPV vaccine. The purpose of this study is to examine factors associated with HPV vaccination status among college women. METHODS: In fall 2008, a convenience sample of 256 undergraduate women enrolled in an introductory social science course at a large, public, urban university in the southeastern United States was surveyed. The 30-item paper-and-pencil questionnaire asked for demographic information, HPV knowledge, HPV vaccine beliefs, and HPV vaccination status. The overall survey response rate was 89.6%. RESULTS: Most women were unmarried/single (91.7%), with a mean age of 18.9 years (range 17-42). Race/ethnicity status included 73.0% white, 17.5% Hispanic, and 7.7% black/African American. One hundred eleven (40.5%) women reported receiving the vaccine. Nonvaccinated women were less likely to have heard of the vaccine through a healthcare provider (odds ratio [OR] 0.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.35) or from a family member (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16-0.68) and more likely to consider a healthcare provider recommendation as being only somewhat important (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.32-6.41) or not important at all (OR 5.61, 95% CI 0.44-71.87) vs. very important. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that healthcare providers have an important role in encouraging HPV vaccination. Continuing education for providers who see preadolescent girls in conjunction with a parent or who treat women of college age may be a worthwhile endeavor.",0
1389,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy among parents contributes to low vaccination coverage in adolescents. To improve health care provider communication and vaccine recommendation practices with hesitant parents, it is important to understand how providers perceive parental HPV vaccine hesitancy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize perceived reasons for parental HPV vaccine hesitancy and identify factors associated with perceived parental hesitancy among providers at community-based pediatric clinics. METHODS: In 2018, providers in 23 community-based pediatric clinics in Tennessee were invited to complete a Web-based baseline survey as part of a larger quality improvement study focused on HPV vaccine uptake. These survey data were used for a cross-sectional, secondary data analysis. Scale scores ranging from 0 to 100 were calculated for provider self-efficacy (confidence in ability to recommend HPV vaccine), provider outcome expectations (expectations that recommendation will influence parents' decisions), and perceived parental HPV vaccine hesitancy. Provider confidence in HPV vaccine safety and effectiveness were categorized as high versus low. Clinic-level exposures examined were clinic size and rural-urban location. Descriptive analyses were used to characterize perceived parental barriers by provider type. Mixed-effects linear regression models were fit taking one exposure variable at a time, whereas controlling for provider type, age, gender, and race to identify provider- and clinic-level factors associated with perceived parental barriers to HPV vaccination. RESULTS: Of the 187 providers located in the 23 clinics, 137 completed the survey. The majority of physician providers were white and female, with a higher percentage of females among nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs). The most common parental barriers to HPV vaccination perceived by providers were concerns about HPV vaccine safety (88%), child being too young (78%), low risk of HPV infection for child through sexual activity (70%), and mistrust in vaccines (59%). In adjusted mixed models, perceived parental HPV vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with several provider-level factors: self-efficacy (P=.001), outcome expectations (P<.001), and confidence in HPV vaccine safety (P=.009). No significant associations were observed between perceived parental HPV vaccine hesitancy and clinic-level factors clinic size nor location. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers developing provider-focused interventions to reduce parental HPV vaccine hesitancy should consider addressing providers' self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and confidence in HPV vaccine safety to help providers communicate more effectively with HPV vaccine hesitant parents.",0
1390,"INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine trials have demonstrated high efficacy in preventing HPV infections and HPV related disease in females ages 16-26. However, there is no source data to demonstrate the impact of the vaccine in other populations who may be at higher risk for HPV related disease. This study examines the impact of HPV vaccination on subsequent HPV detection and sexual behaviors among urban adolescents in a clinical setting. METHODS: A cohort of adolescent women, ages 14-17, were recruited prospectively and matched to historical controls to assess the impact of HPV vaccination. All women completed the same questionnaire and face-to-face interview that assessed sexual behaviors; all provided a clinician or self-collected vaginal swab that was used to test for sexually transmitted infections, including HPV. Logistic regression models, incorporating random pair effects, were used to assess the impact of the HPV vaccine on HPV detection and sexual behaviors between the two groups. RESULTS: Each woman recruited (N=75) was matched to 2 historical controls (HC); most of the recruited women (89.3%) had received one or more doses of the HPV vaccine. At enrollment, detection of quadrivalent vaccine types (HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18) was significantly less in the recruited group (5.3%) as compared to the HC (24%): OR=5.6 (CI=1.9, 16.5), p=0.002. Adolescent women in the HC had a 9.5 times greater odds of HPV infection when the analysis was adjusted to compare those who had 2 or more vaccine doses to their matched controls. The only behavioral difference found was that the recruited women used condoms more frequently. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that HPV vaccination was associated with fewer vaccine-type HPV infections despite incomplete vaccination and high risk sexual behaviors. These data also suggest that sexual behaviors were not altered because of the vaccine.",0
1391,"OBJECTIVE: To identify associations between engaging in oral sex and perceived risk of oral cancer among college men. Also, to identify associations, and their moderating factors, between oral sex and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine acceptance. METHODS: Young men were recruited from 2 university campuses in the South (N = 150). Men completed an audio computer-assisted self-administered interview. RESULTS: With the exception of receiving fellatio, each measure of oral sex behavior was significantly associated with greater perceived risk of oral cancer. Four oral sex behaviors evidenced significant associations with vaccine acceptance. Men engaging in recent oral sex or reporting oral sex behaviors with more than 2 partners were more likely to indicate vaccine intent. African American/black race, communication with parents about sex-related topics, and HPV-related stigma/shame were identified as moderating factors. CONCLUSION: Young college men giving or receiving oral sex with multiple partners may be predisposed to HPV vaccination.",0
1392,"Objective: Australia has implemented a nation-wide programme providing a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to girls and boys through school-based programmes. Previous research has identified three distinct areas for attention: (1) lack of understanding about HPV and HPV vaccination, (2) young people’s desire for involvement in decision-making about HPV vaccination and (3) fear of HPV vaccination. We aimed to develop an intervention to address young people’s low levels of understanding, to promote their involvement in consent and reduce vaccination-related fear and anxiety. Design, Setting, Methods: Formative qualitative research was conducted in six public, private and Catholic schools in the Sydney metropolitan area. Girls who were offered the vaccine in a school programme and aged 12–13 years were interviewed in focus groups. Piloting of materials was conducted in three private schools across Sydney with both girls and boys, and changes and additions were made to the materials in accordance with feedback. Results: We developed an educational intervention aimed at addressing gaps in young people’s knowledge and understanding, and offering strategies to improve confidence with vaccination and reduce needle-related anxiety. Components of the final intervention include film chapters, a magazine, a website, an app and teacher support materials. The intervention is designed for teachers and/or nurses to deliver and is linked to the school-based HPV vaccination programme. Conclusions: This is the first educational intervention designed for young people in HPV school-based vaccination, to be developed from empirical data with the involvement of young people themselves.",0
1393,"OBJECTIVE: To describe human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake, predictors of vaccination, and barriers to vaccination in young women. METHODS: Participants were 13-26-year-old girls and women recruited from an urban, hospital-based clinic. Between June and December 2007, 6 months after they had completed a baseline survey, they were recontacted to assess receipt of at least one HPV vaccine dose and barriers to receiving the vaccine. We assessed whether demographic factors, gynecological history, and attitudes measured at baseline were associated with vaccination at follow-up using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 262 women who completed the baseline study, 189 (72%) participated in this follow-up study. At follow-up, 68 of 189 (36%) had received >or=1 HPV vaccine dose. Factors measured at baseline that predicted vaccination 6 months later included insurance coverage for HPV vaccination (odds ratio [OR] 5.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61-17.49) and the belief that one's parents, partners, and clinicians endorsed HPV vaccination (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.29-3.79); those with a history of an abnormal Pap test were less likely to have received the vaccine (OR 0.30, CI 0.10-0.92). Of the 121 who were unvaccinated, 54 (45%) had not returned to the clinic since the baseline study, 51 (42%) had returned but were not offered vaccine, and 15 (12%) had declined vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to increase HPV vaccination rates in women in the catch-up age group for vaccination should ensure that vaccine costs are covered, promote HPV vaccination as normative, and establish clinic-based systems to prevent missed opportunities for vaccination.",0
1394,"Purpose To improve adolescent immunization coverage in a rural North Carolina county. Methods Adolescent immunization coverage rates in an intervention and four comparison counties were compared over 1 year. We introduced practice-based interventions in seven practices centering on immunization registry-driven recall of adolescents for immunizations with postcard reminders (Phase 1), and 6 months later employed nontargeted school-generated telephone reminders to parents of adolescents (Phase 2). Results Improvements in the intervention county among 11- to 12-year-olds occurred for first-dose human papillomavirus vaccine in both boys (overall change, 14.2%–32.1%) and girls (27.4%–43.4%) and the meningococcal vaccine (34.6%–49.4%). Improvements among adolescents 13–18 years were limited to human papillomavirus vaccine completion in boys (1.6%–4.2%). Improvements were greater during Phase 1 than Phase 2 and among younger adolescents. Coverage improvements in the comparison counties were smaller than those observed in the intervention county. Conclusions A resource-light two-phase intervention led to modest improvements in immunization coverage, most notably in the largest adolescent practice in the county, and suggested potential for further gains, particularly among younger adolescents.",0
1395,"INTRODUCTION: Persistent high risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) has been associated with cervical abnormalities and cancer. There are few studies comparing HIV-infected with uninfected African American women from the Southern U.S. We evaluated medical records of a women's cohort in an urban clinic in Tennessee to assess the prevalence of hrHPV and cytology correlates, as well as HPV vaccination rates. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 50 HIV infected and 304 HIV uninfected women, including Pap smears and hrHPV. RESULTS: HIV-infected women were older than HIV-uninfected women (p<0.0001) and were more likely to have hrHPV (p=<0.0001) and LGSIL/HGSIL (p=0.006). Within the HIV uninfected group, Hispanic women were younger than non-Hispanic African American women (p=0.04) and non-Hispanic white women (p=0.0002). Non-Hispanic African-American women were younger (p=0.004) than non-Hispanic white women. Both HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women had an 11-fold and 5-fold odds, respectively, of having precancerous lesions when harboring hrHPV, compared to hrHPV-uninfected women. Of the 125 HIV-uninfected women, only 17% had received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. None of the 21 vaccine recipients had evidence of SILs compared to 9% of vaccine non-recipients (p=0.35, Fisher's exact test). CONCLUSION: HIV-infected women remained at significantly higher risk for developing cervical precancerous lesions when exposed to hrHPV than their uninfected counterparts. Hispanic women were least likely to have been vaccinated. Missed HPV vaccination trended towards being associated with a higher odds of precancerous lesions. Routine HPV vaccination should be reinforced for adolescents and young women using public hospital facilities of all races and ethnic backgrounds.",0
1396,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate rates of completing the full three-dose prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination regimen in patients who initiated the series and to identify variables associated with not completing vaccination. METHODS: This single-institution review identified all patients initiating HPV vaccination at one of four affiliated clinics between January 2007 and June 2008. Vaccination ""completers"" were defined as patients who had completed all three vaccinations within 12 months of initiating the vaccination series. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with vaccine completion. Variables analyzed included age, type of insurance (private compared with public), practice location (urban compared with suburban), practice type (pediatrics, gynecology, or family practice), and race or ethnicity (white or African American and Hispanic). RESULTS: Of the 1,413 girls and young women who initiated HPV vaccination, 469 (33.2%) completed the vaccine series. Overall, private insurances (odds ratio 1.87, 95% confidence interval 1.26-2.76) and suburban practice locations (odds ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.98) were associated with higher vaccine completion rates. African American race was associated with lower completion rates (odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.65). In multivariable analyses, the combination of younger age (11-17 years) and urban practice location was associated with very low likelihood of completing HPV vaccination (22%; P=.023). CONCLUSION: The HPV vaccine completion rate is low. When resources are limited, disparities in HPV vaccine completion should be considered when developing programs to improve vaccine utilization. Urban girls and young women should be targeted as an at-risk population.",0
1397,"BACKGROUND: Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is associated with the development of anogenital cancers, particularly in men living with HIV (MLWH). We describe the prevalence of anogenital HPV infection, abnormal anal cytology and anogenital warts (AGWs) in MLWH in Johannesburg, and explore whether HPV infection and receipt of antiretroviral treatment is associated with detection of abnormal anal cytology and AGWs. METHODS: We enrolled a cohort of 304 sexually-active MLWH ≥18 years, who completed a questionnaire and physical examination. Genital swabs were collected from all men and intra-anal swabs from 250 (82%). Swabs were tested for HPV DNA and genotypes, and anal smears graded using the Bethesda classification. Factors associated with anogenital disease were assessed by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Two thirds were receiving antiretroviral treatment, for a median 33 months (IQR = 15-58) and 54% were HIV-virologically suppressed. Only 5% reported ever having sex with men. Among 283 genital swabs with valid results, 79% had any HPV, 52% had HR-HPV and 27% had >1 HR-HPV infection. By comparison, 39% of the 227 valid intra-anal swabs had detectable HPV, 25% had any HR-HPV and 7% >1 HR infection. While most anal smears were normal (51%), 20% had ASCUS and 29% were LSIL. No cases had HSIL or cancer. Infection with >1 HR type (adjusted OR [aOR] = 2.39; 95%CI = 1.02-5.58) and alpha-9 types (aOR = 3.98; 95%CI = 1.42-11.16) were associated with having abnormal cytology. Prevalence of AGWs was 12%. Infection with any LR type (aOR = 41.28; 95%CI = 13.57-125.62), >1 LR type (aOR = 4.14; 95%CI = 1.60-10.69), being <6 months on antiretroviral treatment (aOR = 6.90; 95%CI = 1.63-29.20) and having a CD4+ count <200 cells/μL (aOR = 5.48; 95%CI: 1.60-18.78) were associated with having AGWs. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, anogenital HR-HPV infection and associated low-grade disease is common, but severe anal dysplasia was not detected. Findings reinforce the need for HPV vaccination in men for preventing both AGWs and HR-HPV infection. Given the absence of anal HSILs, however, the findings do not support the use of anal screening programmes in this population.",0
1398,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of trained community health educators on the uptake of cervical and breast cancer screening, and HPV vaccination in rural communities in southeast Nigeria. METHODS: A prospective population-based intervention study, with a before-and-after design, involved four randomly selected communities in southeast Nigeria from February 2014 to February 2016. Before the intervention, baseline data were collected on the uptake of cervical and breast cancer prevention services. The intervention was house-to-house education on cervical cancer and breast cancer prevention. Postintervention outcome measures included the uptake of cervical and breast cancer screening, and HPV vaccination within 6 months of intervention. RESULTS: In total, 1327 women were enrolled. Before the intervention, 42 (3.2%) women had undergone cervical cancer screening; afterwards, 897 (67.6%) women had received screening (P<0.001). Clinical breast examination was performed for 59 (4.4%) women before and 897 (67.6%) after the intervention (P<0.001). Only 2 (0.9%) of 214 children eligible for HPV vaccination had received the vaccine before versus 71 (33.2%) after the intervention (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of community health educators for house-to-house cervical and breast cancer prevention education was associated with significant increases in the uptake of cervical cancer screening, clinical breast examination, and HPV vaccination.",0
1399,"BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection was the main cause of cervical cancer. There were only a few reports and detailed data about epidemiological research of HPV infection in rural population of China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cervical cells of rural Chaozhou women were collected, and multiplex real time PCR was firstly performed to detect high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infection, which could detect 13 types of HR-HPV (types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68). Then, HPV-positive samples were typed by HPV GenoArray test. RESULTS: HR-HPV DNA was detected by multiplex real time-PCR in 3830 of 48559 cases (7.89%). There was a peak incidence in age of 55-60 years group, and a lower incidence in who lived in plain group compared with suburban, mountain and seashore group. 3380 cases of HPV positive sample were genotyped, 11.01% (372/3380) cases could not be classified, among the typed 3008 cases, 101 cases were identified without HR-HPV type infection, 2907 cases were infected with one HR-HPV type at least, the 6 most common HR-HPV types in descending order of infection, were type 52 (33.4%, 16 (20.95%), 58 (15.93%), 33 (9.94%), 68 (9.22%) and 18 (8.36%). The combined prevalence of HPV types 16 and 18 accounted for 28.52% of total infection. However, type 52 plus 58 presented 48.23% of total infection. 2209/2907 cases were infected with a single HPV type and 698/2907 cases were infected with multiple types, and multiple infection constituent ratio increased with age, with a peak incidence in age 55-60 years group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed low prevalence of HPV vaccine types (16 and 18) and relatively high prevalence of HPV-52 and -58, support the hypothesis that the second-generation HPV vaccines including HPV-52 and -58 may offer higher protection for women in rural Guangdong Province.",0
1400,"BACKGROUND: Due to the potential of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for decreasing cervical cancer rates in Mainland China, where some of the highest incidences in the world have been reported, our study aimed to assess HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge, and to evaluate the effect of a brief educational intervention on HPV knowledge and vaccine acceptability in Chinese undergraduate students and employed women. METHODS: This multi-center, cross-sectional study was conducted across five representative cities of the five main geographical regions of Mainland China. Participants were selected from one comprehensive university and three to four companies in each city for a total of six comprehensive universities and 16 companies. A 62-item questionnaire on HPV knowledge and HPV vaccine acceptability was administered to participants before and after an educational intervention. The intervention consisted of an informative group lecture. RESULTS: A total of 1146 employed women and 557 female undergraduate students were surveyed between August and November 2011. Baseline HPV knowledge was low among both groups--320/1146 (28%) of employed women and 66/557 (12%) of students had heard of HPV, while only 237/1146 (21%) of employed women and 40/557 (7.2%) of students knew that HPV is related to cervical cancer. After educational instruction, 947/1061 (89%) of employed women and 193/325 (59%) of students knew the relationship between HPV and cervical cancer (χ2 = 1041.8, p < 0.001 and χ2 = 278.5, p < 0.001, respectively). Post-intervention, vaccine acceptability increased from 881/1146 (77%) to 953/1061 (90%), (p = <0.001) in employed women and 405/557 (73%) in students to 266/325 (82%), (p < 0.001). Women in both groups cited concerns about the HPV vaccine's safety, efficacy, and limited use to date as reasons for being unwilling to receive vaccination. 502/1146 (44%) of women were willing to vaccinate their children at baseline, which increased to 857/1061 (81%) post-intervention, p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of our lecture-based education initiative into a government-sponsored or school-based program may improve HPV-related knowledge and HPV vaccine acceptability. Further studies are needed to evaluate and standardize HPV education programs in China.",0
1401,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a risk factor for cervical cancer and can be prevented with the HPV vaccine. AIM: To explore the willingness of parents to pay for HPV vaccine for their offspring. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A survey about the willingness to pay for HPV vaccine was answered by 386 individuals of the highest socioeconomic level who had a daughter aged between 12 and 18 years. The survey included information about the risks of HPV infection. RESULTS: Parents would pay a mean of US$ 758 for the vaccine. Twenty five percent of parents were not willing to pay for it. If the cost of the vaccine would be reduced by 50%, only 4% of parents would not pay for it. The willingness to pay is associated with the price of the vaccine, the income level of respondents and the size of the family. CONCLUSIONS: Most respondents would pay for HPV vaccine for their daughters, despite the relatively high cost.",0
1402,"Routine vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV), the main cause of cervical cancer, is recommended for 11-12 year old girls, yet vaccine uptake is low. This study evaluates a social marketing campaign initiated by 13 North Carolina counties to raise awareness among parents and reduce barriers to accessing the vaccine in a primarily rural area. The 3-month campaign targeted mothers of girls ages 11-12 and healthcare practices serving pre-teen girls in four counties. Principles of social marketing were: product (recommended vaccine against HPV), price (cost, perception of safety and efficacy, and access), promotion (posters, brochures, website, news releases, doctor's recommendation), and place (doctors' offices, retail outlets). We analyzed (1) website traffic, hotline calls, and media placement; (2) cross-sectional surveys of mothers and providers; and (3) HPV immunization rates in intervention versus non-intervention counties. Of respondent mothers (n=225), 82% heard or saw campaign messages or materials. Of respondent providers (n=35), 94% used campaign brochures regularly or occasionally in conversations with parents. HPV vaccination rates within six months of campaign launch were 2% higher for 9-13 year old girls in two of the four intervention counties compared to 96 non-intervention counties. This evaluation supports campaign use in other primarily rural and underserved areas.",0
1403,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) is the most common cancer among sub-Saharan African women. Efficient, global reduction of CC will only be achieved by incorporation of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination into existing programmes. We aimed to investigate the overall and type-specific prevalences and distributions of oncogenic HPVs. METHODS: A total of 1081 women aged 30-65 years were recruited to three sequential studies in Madagascar. Demographic and historical data were obtained from participants, and specimens were self-collected for HPV testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction. HPV-positive women underwent detailed pelvic examination, visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid, biopsy, and endocervical curettage. Data were analysed using χ(2) and t-tests, and logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of all 19 high-risk types of HPV was 39.3%. There were no differences in the prevalences of HPV and CC between rural and urban Malagasy women. The most common high-risk HPV types were HPV-53 (6.2%) and HPV-68 (5.8%), followed by HPV-52 (5.2%), HPV-35 (4.5%), HPV-73 (3.4%), HPV-31 (3.4%), HPV-16 (3.1%), and HPV-18 (3.1%). The prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia≥grade 2 (CIN2+) was 9.4%. CIN1-CIN3 lesions were more common in women in their 30s. The median age of participants with CIN2+ was 44 years (range 37-55). Overall, 25.8% of CIN2+ cases were associated with HPV-16/18. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence to support the introduction of HPV vaccination in eastern African countries such as Madagascar. Further studies are needed to screen younger women and adolescents, to provide a global vision of HPV genotype distributions and to maximize the impact of HPV vaccination.",0
1404,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs in predicting human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination behavioral intentions of vaccine-eligible college men. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were unvaccinated college men aged 18-26 years attending a large public university in the southeastern United States during Spring 2015. METHODS: A nonexperimental, cross-sectional study design was employed. Instrumentation comprised a qualitative elicitation study, expert panel review, pilot test, test-retest, and internal consistency, construct validity, and predictive validity assessments using data collected from an online self-report questionnaire. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 256 college men, and the final structural model exhibited acceptable fit of the data. Attitude toward the behavior (β = .169) and subjective norm (β = 0.667) were significant predictors of behavioral intention, accounting for 58% of its variance. CONCLUSIONS: Practitioners may utilize this instrument for the development and evaluation of TPB-based interventions to increase HPV vaccination intentions of undergraduate college men.",0
1405,"PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to review predictors of knowledge about human papillomavirus (HPV), HPV vaccine, and factors related to HPV vaccine uptake and report a quality assurance project that evaluated HPV vaccine uptake and three-dose completion rates. METHODS: The setting was a small private urban pediatric practice. Chart review was used to describe HPV vaccine uptake and dose completion rates in 2007. The convenience sample included 189 girls aged 12 to 21 years with HPV vaccine uptake. RESULTS: During 2007, 153 girls aged 12 to 17 years and 42 girls aged 18 to 21 years were seen at well-child care visits. HPV vaccine uptake was 72% (n = 110) for the younger group and 79% (n = 33) for the older group. There was no significant difference in HPV vaccine uptake by group. One quarter (24%, n = 46) received the HPV vaccine dose at an episodic visit. The dose completion rate was 64% (n = 120). DISCUSSION: HPV vaccine uptake and dose completion rates were higher than rates reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Effective strategies are needed to promote HPV vaccine uptake and dose completion.",0
1406,"Women in Appalachian Kentucky experience a high burden of cervical cancer and have low rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The purpose of this study was to identify normative influences predicting initial HPV vaccine uptake among a sample of young women in southeastern Kentucky. Women (N = 495), ages 18 through 26 years, were recruited from clinics and community colleges. After completing a questionnaire, women received a free voucher for HPV vaccination. Whether women redeemed the voucher for Dose 1 served as the primary outcome variable. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to estimate the influence of healthcare providers, friends, mothers, and fathers on vaccine uptake. One-quarter of the total sample (25.9%) received Dose 1. Uptake was higher in the clinic sample (45.1%) than in the college sample (6.9%). On multivariate analysis, women indicating that their healthcare provider suggested the vaccine, that their friends would ""definitely"" want them to be vaccinated, and that their fathers would ""definitely"" want them to receive the vaccine all were 1.6 times more likely to receive Dose 1. Interaction effects occurred between recruitment site (clinic vs. community college) and all three of the normative influences retaining multivariate significance, indicating that the associations only applied to the clinic sample. HPV vaccine interventions may benefit from highlighting paternal endorsement, healthcare provider recommendation, and peer support.",0
1407,"INTRODUCTION: ""1-2-3 Pap"" is a video-based intervention designed to improve human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine adherence rates among young women in rural Eastern Kentucky. The efficacy trial for the original intervention linked video exposure with increased likelihood of vaccine series completion among the target audience. Given their historic focus on prevention, local health departments were selected as pilot sites to study implementation of 1-2-3 Pap in a public health setting and identify site-specific variations in its implementation. METHODS: A mixed-method, pre- and post-comparison pilot study conducted between October 2013 and April 2014 addressed three primary research questions: (1) how specific implementation planning activities using existing organizational resources and processes affect the selection and optimization of dissemination channels for evidence-based public health interventions; (2) what organizational resources, processes, or other attributes facilitate or impede implementation of evidence-based public health interventions; and (3) how variation in dissemination channels corresponds with intervention outcomes. RESULTS: Although analysis conducted in October 2014 found that the pilot study did not generate significant changes in HPV vaccine rates, data yielded from the Organizational Readiness to Change Assessment survey instrument and process evaluation interviews revealed variation in pre-study planning and in the use and coordination of staff, the adaptation of materials provided for implementation, and sites' ability to access HPV vaccine rate data throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: The mixed-method pilot study advances dissemination and implementation science through identification of variation in planning activities and use of organizational resources and processes for implementation of prevention interventions in public health settings.",0
1408,"PURPOSE: Breast or cervical cancer screening visits may present an opportunity to motivate mothers to have their daughters vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV). In preparation for a future intervention study, we sought to establish the feasibility of using these visits to identify women with at least one daughter in the appropriate age range for adolescent HPV vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional mailed survey of women who had received breast or cervical cancer screening within the 6-18 months before the survey. The study was conducted at two diverse institutions: one serving a mostly black (54.1%) urban inner-city population and another serving a mostly white (87.5%) suburban population. RESULTS: Our overall response rate was 28% (n = 556) in the urban site and 38% (n = 381) in the suburban site. In the urban site, the proportions of mothers completing mammography or Pap smear visits with HPV vaccine-eligible daughters were 23% and 24%, respectively. In the suburban site, the proportions of mothers completing mammography or Pap smear with at least one vaccine-eligible daughter were 41% and 26%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Women who undergo breast or cervical cancer screening in the two different demographic groups evaluated have at least one adolescent daughter at the appropriate age for HPV vaccination. An important implication of this finding in adolescent daughters of urban mothers is the potential use of maternal breast or cervical cancer screening encounters to target a potentially undervaccinated group.",0
1409,"Comprehensive evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in China has not previously been performed. The objective of this study was to evaluate vaccination as an alternative or addition to primary HPV screening with careHPV (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, USA), and to assess the threshold total cost per vaccinated girl (CVG) at which strategies involving vaccination would become viable compared to screening-only strategies in rural China. We used data from field studies in Shanxi Province to support modelling of HPV vaccination and screening, including local information on sexual behaviour, HPV prevalence, test accuracy, treatment protocols and costs. We evaluated several strategies involving screening once or twice per lifetime or at regular 5-yearly intervals, with or without vaccination of young females at age 15 years, assuming 70% coverage for both screening and vaccination. We also predicted cross-sectional cancer incidence each year to the year 2050 for a range of strategies. We found that strategies involving vaccination would be cost-effective at CVGs of US$50-54 or less, but at CVGs >$54, screening-only strategies would be more cost-effective. If vaccination of young cohorts is combined with two rounds of careHPV screening for women aged 30-59 years in 2012 and 2027, a predicted indicative 33% reduction in cervical cancer incidence by 2030 would be sustained until 2050, with incidence rates decreasing thereafter. In conclusion, taking into account estimated vaccine delivery costs (for 3 doses), a per-dose HPV vaccine cost of approximately <$9-14 would be required for strategies involving vaccination to be cost-effective. Overall, combined screening and vaccination approaches are required to maximise outcomes in rural China.",0
1410,"OBJECTIVES: HIV-infected women are at increased risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Time trends in annual prevalences of cervical high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) genotypes among a non-vaccinated, HIV-infected female cohort in urban Brazil were assessed for the period 2006-2012. METHODS: Cervical specimens were collected for HPV genotyping yearly between January 2006 and December 2012 in a cross-sectional analysis of participants aged ≥18 years enrolled in the Women's HIV Cohort at Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Age-adjusted generalized estimating equation models with an exchangeable matrix were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for annual HPV positivity (reference year: 2006). RESULTS: Among the 590 participants, the median age across all study years ranged from 35.5 to 40.0 years. The prevalence of any HR-HPV was ≥53% every year; prevalences of HR-HPV 16, 58, 59, and 68 were ≥24% in at least 1 year. The odds of HPV 16 and 68 decreased in 2012. HPV 58 prevalence followed a U-shape, beginning and ending at >20%. HPV 59 prevalence followed a linear trend, with increased odds in 2012 (OR 16.0, 95% CI 3.8-67.3; Bonferroni-adjusted p-value <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalences of HR-HPV 58, 59, and 68 were high in this cohort. Given current HR-HPV vaccine coverage and availability, further investigations are needed to optimize vaccine recommendations for this population.",0
1411,"OBJECTIVES: We examined the prevalence and correlates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine initiation among adolescents in low-income, urban areas. METHODS: The study consisted of electronic health record data on HPV vaccination for 3180 adolescents (aged 10-20 years) at a multisite community health center in 2011. RESULTS: Only 27% initiated the HPV vaccine. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of HPV vaccination was lower among older adolescents (AOR = 0.552; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.424, 0.718) and those seen by nonpediatric health care providers (HCPs; AOR = 0.311; 95% CI = 0.222, 0.435), and higher among non-English speakers (AOR = 1.409; 95% CI = 1.134, 1.751) and those seen at 2 site locations (AOR = 1.890; 95% CI = 1.547, 2.311). Insurance status was significant only among female and Hispanic adolescents. Language was not a predictor among Hispanic adolescents. Across all analyses, the interaction of age and HCP specialty was associated with HPV vaccination. Dramatically lower HPV vaccination rates were found among older adolescents seen by nonpediatric HCPs (3%-5%) than among other adolescents (23%-45%). CONCLUSIONS: Improving HPV vaccination initiation in low-income urban areas is critical to reducing disparities in cervical and other HPV-related cancer, especially among Black, Hispanic, and low-income populations.",0
1412,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine knowledge, attitudes, barriers, and facilitators for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among Latina mothers of HPV vaccine-eligible children in low-income urban areas, as well as useful strategies to improve HPV vaccination. Methods: The study included 132 Latina mothers of HPV vaccine-eligible children, interviewed in 14 focus groups. Using semi-structured discussions, mothers were asked about their knowledge about HPV infection and vaccine, views toward HPV vaccination, barriers for HPV vaccine initiation as well as completion, and opinions on strategies to improve HPV vaccination. Results: Only 55% of mothers reported having ever heard of the HPV vaccine, 27% of mothers indicated initiating the HPV vaccine, and 14% indicated completing the multi-dose series. Mothers generally lacked knowledge about HPV infection and vaccination, with varying degrees by Latino descent. Health care provider (HCP) recommendation was the strongest barrier/facilitator for HPV vaccination. Useful strategies to improve HPV vaccine initiation and completion that the mothers suggested included strong recommendation from HCPs and addressing side effects and safety concerns. Other useful strategies included community and school-based approaches and the use of text messaging and smartphone technology to educate mothers and send vaccine reminders. Conclusion: The findings provide insight for the development of interventions targeting low-income Latina mothers and the need to improve HCP communication on HPV vaccination.",0
1413,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake is low among adolescent girls in the United States. We sought to identify longitudinal predictors of HPV vaccine initiation in populations at elevated risk for cervical cancer. METHODS: We interviewed a population-based sample of parents of 10- to 18-year-old girls in areas of North Carolina with elevated cervical cancer rates. Baseline interviews occurred in summer 2007 and follow-up interviews in fall 2008. Measures included health belief model constructs. RESULTS: Parents reported that 27% (149/567) of their daughters had initiated HPV vaccine between baseline and follow-up. Of parents who at baseline intended to get their daughters the vaccine in the next year, only 38% (126/348) had done so by follow-up. Of parents of daughters who remained unvaccinated at follow-up but had seen a doctor since baseline, only 37% (122/388) received an HPV vaccine recommendation. Rates of HPV vaccine initiation were higher among parents who at baseline perceived lower barriers to getting HPV vaccine, anticipated greater regret if their daughters got HPV because they were unvaccinated, did not report ""needing more information"" as the main reason they had not already vaccinated, intended to get their daughters the vaccine, or were not born-again Christians. CONCLUSIONS: Missed opportunities to increase HPV vaccine uptake included unrealized parent intentions and absent doctor recommendations. While several health belief model constructs identified in early acceptability studies (e.g., perceived risk, perceived vaccine effectiveness) were not longitudinally associated with HPV vaccine initiation, our findings suggest correlates of uptake (e.g., anticipated regret) that offer novel opportunities for intervention.",0
1414,"Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a very common sexually transmitted infection linked to cervical disease. Vaccines for some types of HPV were in development at the time of the study. Purpose: The study examined HPV vaccine acceptability among underserved women in a rural region of the southeastern U.S. with high rates of cervical cancer for development of future educational interventions. Methods: A clinic-based sample of women (aged 18-64; ASCUS or higher and tested for HPV DNA) completed a telephone interview (response rate = 78%). Results: Among participants who had ever heard of HPV (n=108), 81% were 'very likely' to get the vaccine and 72% would have their daughter vaccinated. These participants desired information about vaccine safety (100%), efficacy (100%), side effects (100%), clinician recommendation (96%), cost (94%), and composition of the vaccine (94%). Cost was identified as the main barrier (55%). Among a subset of participants who reported HPV positivity (n=49), younger age, being single, and high HPV knowledge level were associated with specific types of desired information before getting the HPV vaccine. Discussion: Similar to previously reported vaccine acceptability studies, acceptance among participants in this rural region of the south was also high. Participants also desired more information about the vaccine. Translation to Health Education Practice: Public health educational efforts must address health education issues related to vaccine acceptability and increase HPV knowledge and understanding.",0
1415,"PURPOSE: Conducting research in a rural area can be challenging for nurses for a variety of different reasons. The task at hand can be especially difficult when it involves discussing a sensitive topic, such as Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. This study was conducted to describe parental perceptions of the HPV vaccine in rural areas, while simultaneously describing a method for engaging in successful nursing research in rural areas. METHODS: A team of nurse researchers completed a planned process to first understand rural culture in southeastern Georgia, and then more specifically, the families living in these three separate counties. This process initially involved developing a connection and working relationship with key community leaders, such as school principals. Following this, researchers worked on establishing rapport and trust with local parents and research participants themselves. Qualitative methods were then used to collect focus group and interview data on parental views of HPV, HPV vaccination, and HPV-related cancers. FINDINGS: Results indicated that parents had little knowledge of the HPV vaccine in rural Georgia, including misconceptions that the vaccine is for females only. In addition, many parents continually voiced the concern that the HPV vaccine would promote promiscuity in their children. CONCLUSIONS: Providing consistent, timely, and open communication with the community members was crucial throughout the entire research process. This focused approach with respect to total community, culture, and religious value is essential in conducting research. Future studies conducted in rural areas should focus on specific intervention points that improve Parental HPV knowledge.",0
1416,"Background. HPV vaccination may prevent thousands of cases of cervical cancer. We aimed to evaluate the understanding and acceptance of the HPV vaccine among adolescents. Methods. A questionnaire was distributed to adolescents at health clinics affiliated with a large urban hospital system to determine knowledge pertaining to sexually transmitted diseases and acceptance of the HPV vaccine. Results. 223 adolescents completed the survey. 28% were male, and 70% were female. The mean age for respondents was 16 years old. Adolescents who had received the HPV vaccine were more likely to be female and to have heard of cervical cancer and Pap testing. Of the 143 adolescents who had not yet been vaccinated, only 4% believed that they were at risk of HPV infection and 52% were willing to be vaccinated. Conclusions. Surveyed adolescents demonstrated a marginal willingness to receive the HPV vaccine and a lack of awareness of personal risk for acquiring HPV.",0
1417,"BACKGROUND: Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted viral infection worldwide. HPV is highly prevalent in sexually active men who have sex with men (MSM) and has been associated with anal cancer, penile cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer. METHODS: From March to September 2011, we conducted a cross-sectional study of HPV prevalence among MSM above age 18 years. Participants were recruited using respondent driven sampling at Clinica Cayetano Heredia. All participants provided anal, genital, and oral samples for HPV DNA testing, and blood for HIV and HPV antibody testing. RESULTS: A total of 200 MSM were recruited in the study. The mean age was 34 years (range 18-59 years, SD = 9.4) and101 participants were HIV negative (99 HIV positive). HPV 6/11/16/18 or quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) genotype seroprevalence among HIV negative and positive MSM was 64.3% (55%-75.9%) and 93.8% (87.6%-99.2%) respectively (p<0.001). HIV positivity was associated with a higher prevalence of HPV4 and HPV 16/18 DNA at external genital sites and the anal canal. HPV4 DNA prevalence at external genital sites among HIV negative and positive MSM was 14.9% and 28.7% (p = 0.02) respectively, at anal canal was 50.9% and 79.0% (p = 0.001), and at the oral cavity was 9.9% and 8.5% (p = 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: HPV4 seroprevalence was high in our study among both HIV positives and negatives, with HPV DNA prevalence much lower, and the anal canal being the anatomical site with the highest HPV DNA prevalence. HPV prevention interventions are needed among MSM at high-risk for HIV infection.",0
1418,"BACKGROUND: Nearly 80 million people in the U.S. are currently infected with at least one of two strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is associated with 70% of cervical cancers. Greater cervical cancer mortality has been observed among women of lower SES and those living in rural, versus urban, areas. African American and Hispanic women are significantly more likely to die from cervical cancer than non-Hispanic white women. PURPOSE: To assess current population awareness of and knowledge about HPV and the HPV vaccine, as well as the contribution of sociodemographic characteristics to disparities in HPV awareness and knowledge. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained from the National Cancer Institute's 2013 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS; N=3,185). Multivariable logistic regression was employed to identify gaps in awareness and knowledge by sex, education, income, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and other important sociodemographic characteristics. Analyses were conducted in 2014. RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of Americans had heard of HPV and the HPV vaccine. Consistent with the Knowledge Gap Hypothesis, awareness and knowledge were patterned by sex, age, education, and other important sociodemographic factors. Those in rural areas were less likely than those in urban areas to know that HPV causes cervical cancer. Less than 5% of Americans were aware that HPV often clears on its own without treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although awareness and knowledge of HPV is increasing, there are opportunities to target communication with populations for whom knowledge gaps currently exist, in order to promote dialogue about the vaccine among patients and their providers.",0
1419,"PURPOSE: This study examined human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine awareness and uptake, and communication with a parent and/or a health care provider among 11- to 18-year-old male and female adolescents in an Appalachian Ohio county. METHODS: Five questions regarding the HPV vaccine were added to the 2012 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) surveys administered to middle and high school students in the county. The YRBSS surveys are school-based, anonymous, and voluntary. The questions added were about vaccine awareness and uptake, and communication with a parent or health care provider about the vaccine. RESULTS: Of the 1,299 participants, 51.9% were male and 90.3% were white. Overall, 49.2%, 23.5%, 19.2%, and 24.6%, respectively, reported vaccine awareness, uptake of at least 1 dose of the HPV vaccine, communication with a parent, and communication with a health care provider. Females and adolescents ≥ 15 years were significantly more likely to report awareness, uptake, and parental and provider communication than males and adolescents ≤ 14 years. Adolescents receiving any dose of the vaccine were significantly more likely to have had a parent (OR: 3.74; 95% CI: 2.30-6.06) or a health care provider (OR: 10.91; 95% CI: 6.42-18.6) discuss the vaccine than those who had not received any dose. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the strong link between parental and health care provider communication and HPV vaccine uptake, the levels of communication remain low in this Appalachian population. These findings suggest the need for public health education programs targeting the health care providers, the parents, and the adolescents to improve awareness, knowledge, and HPV vaccine uptake.",0
1420,Extending two-dose recommendations of HPV vaccine to girls between 15 and 18 years will reduce program cost and improve compliance. Immunogenicity and vaccine targeted HPV infection outcomes were compared between 1795 girls aged 15-18 years receiving two (1-180 days) and 1515 girls of same age receiving three (1-60-180 days) doses. Immunogenicity outcomes in 15-18 year old two-dose recipients were also compared with the 10-14 year old three-dose (N = 2833) and two-dose (N = 3184) recipients. The 15-18 year old two-dose recipients had non-inferior L1-binding antibody titres at seven months against vaccine-targeted HPV types compared to three-dose recipients at 15-18 years and three-dose recipients at 10-14 years of age. Neutralizing antibody titres at 18 months in 15-18 year old two-dose recipients were non-inferior to same age three-dose recipients for all except HPV 18. The titres were inferior to those in the 10-14 year old three-dose recipients for all targeted types. Frequency of incident infections from vaccine-targeted HPV types in the 15-18 year old two-dose recipients was similar to the three dose recipients. None of the girls receiving two or three doses had persistent infection from vaccine-targeted types. These findings support that two doses of HPV vaccine can be extended to girls aged 15-18 years.,0
1421,"OBJECTIVES: To assess human papillomavirus prophylactic vaccine coverage among a representative population of French girls, aged 14 years and above, attending middle and high schools, and to determine factors associated with the initiation and completion of the vaccination protocol. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study, designed with cluster sampling, was conducted from October 2010 to May 2011, in 29 schools in the department of Côte d'Or, France. The schools were randomized according to their status (public or private) and location (rural or urban). Two classes per level were then included. All analyses were stratified on age. RESULTS: 948 questionnaires were collected (87.9% participation). Mean age was 15.2 years (SD=1.3), ranging between 14 and 19. Only 31.7% of 14-year-old girls and 61.4% of girls aged 15 and above initiated vaccination (one dose), and 7.8% of 14-year-old girls and 48.5% of girls aged 15 and above completed it (three doses). An urban school location and a physician's recommendation were independently associated with vaccination initiation in girls aged 14. In girls aged 15 and above, the parents' socioeconomic status, the family composition and a recommendation by a physician were independently associated with vaccination initiation. Once vaccination had been initiated, girls who attended private school, who belonged to families with higher outcomes, who lived with a single parent or who smoked were less likely to complete the vaccination protocol. CONCLUSION: HPV prophylactic vaccine coverage in girls attending school in Côte d'Or appears to be low. Physicians play a major role in vaccine acceptance.",0
1422,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the probability of having heard about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination differs by socio-demographic characteristics among Colombian women; and whether the effect of predictors of having heard about HPV vaccination varies by educational levels and rural/urban area of residence. METHODS: Data of 53,521 women aged 13-49 years were drawn from the 2010 Colombian National Demographic and Health Survey. Women were asked about aspects of their health and their socio-demographic characteristics. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with having heard about HPV vaccination. Educational level and rural/urban area of residence of the women were tested as modifier effects of predictors. RESULTS: 26.8% of the women had heard about HPV vaccination. The odds of having heard about HPV vaccination were lower among women: in low wealth quintiles, without health insurance, with subsidized health insurance, and those who had children (p<0.001). Although women in older age groups and with better education had higher probabilities of having heard about HPV vaccination, differences in these probabilities by age group were more evident among educated women compared to non-educated ones. Probability gaps between non-educated and highly educated women were wider in the Eastern region. Living in rural areas decreased the probability of having heard about HPV vaccination, although narrower rural/urban gaps were observed in the Atlantic and Amazon-Orinoquía regions. CONCLUSIONS: Almost three quarters of the Colombian women had not heard about HPV vaccination, with variations by socio-demographic characteristics. Women in disadvantaged groups were less likely to have heard about HPV vaccination.",0
1423,"BACKGROUND: While national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination estimates exist by sex, little is known about HPV vaccination rates by gender identity. METHODS: We conducted a self-administered, anonymous online cross-sectional survey, with recruitment through Facebook ads, of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals in rural areas of the US. We compared HPV vaccine recommendation and uptake by self-reported sex assigned at birth and current gender identity. RESULTS: Six hundred sixty respondents were age eligible for HPV vaccination: 84% reported gender identity aligned with their sex assigned at birth, while 10% reported gender identity the differed from their sex assigned at birth; an additional 6% reported non-binary gender identity. Only 14% of male sex assigned at birth and 44% of female sex assigned at birth received HPV vaccine, similar to estimates by current gender identity. Transgender respondents' HPV vaccination experience mirrored that of cisgender respondents with regard to sex assigned at birth. CONCLUSIONS: Providers may base HPV vaccine recommendations on individuals' sex assigned at birth, which may impact transgender individuals' vaccine coverage. Future HPV vaccine uptake studies should account for gender identity. With sex-specific catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations, the role of gender identity on provider recommendation and reimbursement needs to be addressed.",0
1424,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence varies widely worldwide. We used a transmission model to show links between age-specific sexual patterns and HPV vaccination effectiveness. We considered rural India and the United States as examples of 2 heterosexual populations with traditional age-specific sexual behavior and gender-similar age-specific sexual behavior, respectively. We simulated these populations by using age-specific rates of sexual activity and age differences between sexual partners and found that transitions from traditional to gender-similar sexual behavior in women <35 years of age can result in increased (2.6-fold in our study) HPV16 prevalence. Our model shows that reductions in HPV16 prevalence are larger if vaccination occurs in populations before transitions in sexual behavior and that increased risk for HPV infection attributable to transition is preventable by early vaccination. Our study highlights the importance of using time-limited opportunities to introduce HPV vaccination in traditional populations before changes in age-specific sexual patterns occur.",0
1425,"AIM: The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for adolescent girls and young women; however, the social structure in India will not permit vaccination of this age-group without parental approval. Our study aimed to explore the attitude of affluent, urban Indian parents towards the HPV vaccine. METHODS: Well-to-do married couples with at least one daughter between 9-26 years of age were interviewed using a questionnaire in two parts. The first part was to assess their attitude to vaccination in general and their knowledge of cervical cancer; the second part was to assess their acceptance of the HPV vaccine. An educational fact sheet about cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine was administered in between the two parts. RESULTS: Of the 522 participants, 27% of men and 24% of women agreed to vaccinate their daughters against a cancer initially. After going through the fact sheet, 74% of both men and women were in favor of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: The HPV vaccine seems to be well accepted among this subgroup of population if appropriately educated.",0
1426,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the correlates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination or willingness to be vaccinated in urban, minority adolescents. METHODS: Using responses to the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey in Philadelphia, a random sample of high schools provided weighted data representing 20,941 9th to 12th graders. Stratified by either having had or willingness to have the vaccine, bivariate analysis with sexual behavior, preventive health behaviors, mental health, substance use, and demographic characteristics were examined and then multivariable regression models were developed to estimate significant correlates. RESULTS: Respondents were 52.3% female, 84.4% non-White, and 65.9% ≥16 years; 43% reported having had the HPV vaccine, and of those not vaccinated, 66% reported willingness to be vaccinated. Logistic regression models indicate that females (odds ratio [OR] = 3.12, p < .01) and those reporting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing (OR = 2.10, p < .01) were more likely to be vaccinated. Those reporting condom use during last intercourse (OR = 0.40; p = .05) and current marijuana use (OR = 0.37; p = .03) were less likely to indicate willingness to be vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Important areas for intervention include addressing misconceptions or feelings of ""immunity,"" especially for those using condoms. Understanding the correlation between HIV testing and HPV vaccination is also an important intervention opportunity for schools hoping to increase adolescent vaccination rates.",0
1427,"Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the awareness level of women about cervical smears, human papilloma virus (HPV), and HPV vaccine in a rural city in the central part of Anatolia. Materials and Methods: A total of 553 patients were included in the study. A 16 item questionnaire developed by our group was completed by all participants. The first part of the questionnaire collected the demographic and socioeconomic information of the participants. In the second part, it was questioned whether this information had a relationship with HPV, HPV vaccine awareness, and cervical screening tests. In the third part, the participants were asked questions related to the acceptance of an HPV vaccine for themselves and their willingness to give consent to have their children vaccinated. Results: In our study, it was found that HPV awareness significantly increased with the level of education, occupational status and total monthly family income (p<0.001). There was a significant increase in HPV vaccine awareness as the parity (p=0.016), level of education (p=0.025), and occupational status (p=0.001) increased. Having a Pap smear significantly increased with age, income, and number of parity (p<0.001). Conclusion: Our study revealed that only 9.8% of the women had knowledge about HPV, the majority of the women reported that they would accept vaccination for themselves and for their children. These results indicate that physicians should pay attention to increasing the awareness about HPV.",0
1428,"INTRODUCTION: Previous research has consistently demonstrated that, in comparison to their cisgender heterosexual counterparts, lesbians face a multitude of women's healthcare-related disparities. However, very little research has been conducted that takes an intersectionality approach to examining the potential influences of rural-urban location on the health-related needs and experiences of lesbians. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively compare rural and urban lesbians' access to women's health care, experiences with women's healthcare providers (WHCPs), and preventive behavior using a large, diverse sample of lesbians from across the USA. METHODS: A total of 895 (31.1% rural and 68.9% urban) lesbian-identified cisgender women (ie not transgender) from the USA participated in the current online study. As part of a larger parent study, participants were recruited from across the USA through email communication to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)-focused organizations and online advertisements. Participants were asked to complete a series of questions related to their women's healthcare-related experiences and behaviors (ie access to care, experiences with WHCPs, and preventive behavior). A series of &#967;2 analyses were utilized in order to examine rural-urban differences across dependent variables. RESULTS: An examination of sexual risks revealed that relatively more rural lesbians reported at least one previous male sexual partner in comparison to the urban sample of lesbians (78.1% vs 69.1%, &#967;2(1, <i>N</i>=890)=7.56, <i>p</i>=0.006).<b> </b>A similarly low percentage of rural (42.4%) and urban (42.9%) lesbians reported that they have a WHCP that they see on a regular basis for preventive care. In terms of experiences with WHCP providers, relatively fewer rural lesbians indicated that their current WHCP had discussed/recommended the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in comparison to urban lesbians (27.5% vs. 37.2%; &#967;2 (1, N=796)=7.24, <i>p</i>=0.007). No other rural-urban differences in experiences with WHCPs emerged - few rural and urban lesbians had been asked about their sexual orientation by their WHCP (38.8% and 45.0%, respectively), been provided with appropriate safe-sex education by their WHCP (21.4% and 25.3%), had their last HIV/sexually transmitted infection screening instigated by their WHCP (if applicable; 15.7% and 19.5%), and reported that their WHCP seems knowledgeable about lesbian health concerns (56.5% vs 54.6%). In terms of preventive behavior, significantly fewer rural lesbians aged 40 years or more had received a mammogram in the past 3 years (63.2% vs 83.2%; &#967;2(1, <i>N</i>=163)=8.36, <i>p</i>=0.004) when compared to their urban counterparts. No other significant rural-urban differences in preventive behaviors emerged. A similarly low percentage of rural and urban lesbians indicated that they have received the HPV vaccination (22.8% and 29.0%, respectively) and/or have had a HIV/STI screening (43.0% and 47.8%), Pap test (62.0% and 64.5%) or breast exam (59.2% and 62.8%), in the past 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings highlight that rural lesbians in the USA, in comparison to urban lesbians, may experience elevated health risks related to being more likely to have at least one previous male sexual partner, less likely to be recommended the HPV vaccination by a WHCP, and, for those 40 or older, less likely to receive routine mammogram screenings. Furthermore, rural lesbians appear to engage in similarly low rates of HPV vaccination and regular HIV/STI screenings, Pap tests, and clinical breast exams as their urban counterparts. Given the increased cervical and breast cancer risks associated with rural living, the current findings underscore the dire need for health promotion efforts aimed at increasing rural lesbians' engagement in routine pelvic and breast exams.",0
1429,"BACKGROUND: Young sexual minority individuals have lower human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine completion rates than the general population, and little is known about how gender minority people perceive HPV vaccination. The aim of this study was to qualitatively identify patient-, provider-, and systems-level barriers and facilitators for HPV vaccination among sexual and gender minority (SGM) people. METHODS: Fifteen SGM-identified individuals, ages 23-26, were recruited at an urban community health center in Boston, MA, that specializes in care for SGM. Participants were enrolled in a study that utilized surveys and in-person focus groups. During focus groups, participants were asked to describe their perceived barriers and facilitators for completion of HPV vaccination. RESULTS: Fourteen participants reported having a sexual minority identity, and five participants reported having a gender minority identity. Participants described the following factors influencing HPV vaccination: (1) at the patient level, low HPV-related knowledge and lack of engagement in care were associated with less vaccination, whereas fear of HPV-related disease motivated vaccination; (2) at the provider level, knowledge and SGM cultural-competence related to HPV was associated with patient willingness to be vaccinated; (3) at the systems level, SGM identity-affirming healthcare settings were associated with increased vaccination, whereas historical trends in HPV vaccine marketing selectively for cisgender women and lack of public awareness of HPV-related disease among SGM were associated with decreased vaccincation. CONCLUSION: Our study identified internal and external barriers for HPV vaccination related among SGM patients. These findings highlight the need to increase public awareness about the risks of HPV-related disease among SGM and educate SGM youth about HPV-related disease and vaccine importance. Finally, this study supports the need for future interventions to cultivate SGM-competent providers and SGM identity-affirming healthcare settings as a way to increase HPV vaccination.",0
1430,"BACKGROUND: In Mozambique cervical cancer is a public health threat, due to its high incidence and limited access to early diagnosis of precancerous lesions. International organisations are supporting the introduction of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in low- and middle-income countries. Some of these countries recently conducted demonstration programmes, which included evaluation of acceptability, coverage, and practicality of implementation and of integration in existing programmes. Information on costs of delivering the vaccine is needed to overcome the challenges of reaching vaccine potential recipients in rural and remote areas. METHODS: We estimated the financial and economic costs of delivering HPV vaccination to ten-year-old girls at schools for the first vaccination cycle of the demonstration programme in the Manhiça district (southern Mozambique), delivered throughout 2014. We also estimated costs of an alternative scenario with a reduced number of doses and personnel, which was analogous to the second vaccination cycle delivered throughout 2015. Cost estimates followed a micro-costing approach and included interviews with key informants at different administrative levels through the administration of standard questionnaires developed by the World Health Organisation. RESULTS: Considering only data from the first vaccination cycle (2014), which consisted in the administration of three doses, the average economic cost was US$17.59 per dose and US$52.29 per fully-immunised girl (FIG). Financial cost per dose (US$6.07) and per FIG (US$17.95) were substantially lower. The economic cost was US$15.53 per dose and US$31.14 per FIG when estimating an alternative cost scenario with reduced number of doses and personnel. CONCLUSIONS: The average economic cost per dose was lower than the ones recently reported for low- and middle-income countries. However, our estimation of the financial cost per FIG was higher than the ones observed elsewhere (ranging from US$2.49 in India to US$20.36 in Vietnam) due to the high percentage of out-of-school girls which, reduced vaccine coverage and, therefore, reduced the denominator. Due to budget constraints, if Mozambique is to implement nation-wide HPV vaccination targeted to ten-year-old girls at schools, a reduction in personnel costs should be operated either by restricting the outreach vaccinator team or the number of supervision visits.",0
1431,"BACKGROUND: Despite the established role of the Pap smear test (PST) in prevention and early detection of cervical cancer, it is still rarely practiced in Sudan. Many challenges hinder the establishment of an effective cervical cancer screening program, including socio-cultural factors. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of Sudanese women with regard to the Pap smear test and cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 500 married women aged 14 to 58 years were recruited from obstetric clinics, hospitals and universities in Khartoum in 2014. Data were collected using a standardized, pretested questionnaire that inquired socio-demographic characteristics and their KAP about cervical cancer and the PST. RESULTS: More than 52% of participating women were above 30 years of age, and the majority (78.8%) were university degree holders. A total of 486 (97.2 %) of participants were resident in urban areas of Khartoum State. However about 48% of the respondents had never heard about PST, and only 15.8% of the participants had undergone a Pap smear test previously; 46.6% (233/500) knew that the human papilloma virus (HPV) was the causative agent, but only 39.2% (196/500) had heard about HPV vaccination, and only 11.4% (57/500) had received the vaccine. However 68% of the respondents agreed to do Pap smear if properly informed about the test and 75.4% of the respondents agreed to participate in a cervical cancer screening program. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high educational level, less than half of our participants had accurate knowledge about cervical cancer, HPV, and cervical cancer screening. Health education about cervical cancer, HPV and sexually transmitted infections and the role of PST in cervical cancer prevention are crucial when designing interventions aimed at improving cervical cancer screening for Sudanese women.",0
1432,"OBJECTIVE: In October 2011, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4) for the routine immunization schedule for 11- to 12-year-old boys. Before October 2011, HPV4 was permissively recommended for boys. We conducted a study in 2010 to provide data that could guide efforts to implement routine HPV4 immunization in boys. Our objectives were to describe primary care physicians': 1) knowledge and attitudes about human papillomavirus (HPV)-related disease and HPV4, 2) recommendation and administration practices regarding HPV vaccine in boys compared to girls, 3) perceived barriers to HPV4 administration in boys, and 4) personal and practice characteristics associated with recommending HPV4 to boys. METHODS: We conducted a mail and Internet survey in a nationally representative sample of pediatricians and family medicine physicians from July 2010 to September 2010. RESULTS: The response rate was 72% (609 of 842). Most physicians thought that the routine use of HPV4 in boys was justified. Although it was permissively recommended, 33% recommended HPV4 to 11- to 12-year-old boys and recommended it more strongly to older male adolescents. The most common barriers to HPV4 administration were related to vaccine financing. Physicians who reported recommending HPV4 for 11- to 12-year-old boys were more likely to be from urban locations, perceive that HPV4 is efficacious, perceive that HPV-related disease is severe, and routinely discuss sexual health with 11- to 12-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS: Although most physicians support HPV4 for boys, physician education and evidence-based tools are needed to improve implementation of a vaccination program for males in primary care settings.",0
1433,"BACKGROUND: HPV vaccination programs have adversely affected participation in future cervical cancer screening. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of decision satisfaction with accepting/rejecting the HPV vaccine, as well as traditional clinical factors, on the intent to participate in future screening. METHODS AND FINDINGS: From January 2011 through August 2012 women 18-26 years old presenting for health care in an urban college student health and wellness clinic in the US Midwest were asked to complete a descriptive and medical history survey including a six element decisional satisfaction survey scored on 5-point Likert scales, where the intent to participate in future cervical cancer screening was measured. Of the 568 women who completed the decisional satisfaction survey, 17% of those <21 years and 7% ≥ 21 years indicated no intent to participate in future cervical cancer screenings. Among women of current screening age, the univariate risk factors of race/ethnicity, contraceptive use, number of lifetime sexual partners, and receipt of HPV vaccine were not predictors of intent for future cervical cancer screening. Instead, only a history of a prior Pap test was a significant positive predictor and only a decisional satisfaction of 'neutral' (Likert score = 3) for any of the four decisional satisfaction elements was a significant negative predictor. For the decisional satisfaction element ""best for me personally"", there was a 78% decreased likelihood of intending to participate in future screening if the satisfaction was neutral rather than firm (aOR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.91) and a 26 fold increased likelihood if she had had a prior Pap test (aOR = 26, 95% CI: 5-133). CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination implementation programs must help women be the owner of their decision around HPV vaccination and understand the importance of future participation in cervical cancer screening.",0
1434,"OBJECTIVE: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for female adolescents aged 11 to 12 years, yet vaccination rates remain low. We conducted a qualitative study to understand English- and Spanish-speaking parents' reasons for noninitiation or noncompletion of the HPV vaccine series for their daughters. METHODS: Parents of female adolescents aged 12 to 15 years who had not initiated or not completed the HPV vaccine series were identified through administrative data in 2 large urban safety net health care systems in Colorado. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were conducted with English-speaking parents and in-depth interviews were conducted with Spanish-speaking parents. All data were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for thematic content by experienced analysts using established qualitative content analysis techniques. RESULTS: Forty-one parents participated in the study. Thirty parents participated in individual interviews and 11 parents participated in 1 of 2 focus groups. The most common reasons for noninitiation and noncompletion among English-speaking parents included a low perceived risk of HPV infection, vaccine safety concerns, and distrust of government and/or medicine. In contrast, Spanish-speaking parents most often reported that providers had either not encouraged initiation of the HPV vaccine series or had not explained the necessity of completing the series. Some noninitiating parents, particularly Spanish-speaking ones, also cited concerns that vaccination would encourage sexual activity. CONCLUSIONS: The reasons for noninitiation and noncompletion of the HPV vaccine series differed substantially between English- and Spanish-speaking parents. To maximize uptake of HPV vaccine, varying approaches might be needed to effectively target specific populations.",0
1435,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the practice and associated factors of HPV vaccine among school girls in Melaka, Malaysia. METHODOLOGY: A total number of 612 secondary school girls participated in this study. The questionnaire consists of 38 questions which included 3 sections. The first section is about socio- demography. The Second section is about knowledge and awareness of HPV vaccines. The third section is about practices with associated barriers of HPV vaccination. Verbal consent was obtained from all participants, and data were analyzed using SPSS 13. RESULTS: A total number of 612 secondary school girl students participated in this study. The mean age was 13.93 ± SD (1.09); minimum age was 13 years old and maximum was 17 years old. The majority of them was Malay, from rural areas and had a family monthly income of RM 3000 or less (91.8%, 53.1%, 69.6%; respectively). The majority of the parents of the school girls were with secondary education level (56.4%). The majority of the participants did not have a family history of cervical cancer (99.0%). The prevalence of HPV vaccination was 77.9% among school girls in Melaka. The majority of the participants were vaccinated in their schools (77.0%). About 69% knew about cervical cancer and 77.6% had ever heard about HPV vaccine. Regarding the factors that influence the practice of uptake HPV vaccine, they were age, race, income, parents' education, knowledge about cervical cancer, heard about HPV vaccine and place of getting the vaccine (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HPV vaccine among school girls is high. Age, race, income, parents' education, knowledge about cervical cancer, heard about HPV vaccine and place of getting the vaccine were the significant factors that influence the practice of uptake HPV vaccine among school girls.",0
1436,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer mortality among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Recent recommendations for cervical cancer primary prevention highlight HPV vaccination, and secondary prevention through screening. However, few studies have examined the different dimensions of health care access, and how these may influence screening behavior, especially in the context of clinical preventive services. METHODS: Using the 2003 South Africa World Health Survey, we determined the prevalence of cervical cancer screening with pelvic examinations and/or pap smears among women ages 18 years and older. We also examined the association between multiple dimensions of health care access and screening focusing on the affordability, availability, accessibility, accommodation and acceptability components. RESULTS: About 1 in 4 (25.3%, n = 65) of the women who attended a health care facility in the past year got screened for cervical cancer. Screened women had a significantly higher number of health care providers available compared with unscreened women (mean 125 vs.12, p-value <0.001), and were more likely to have seen a medical doctor compared with nurses/midwives (73.1% vs. 45.9%, p-value = 0.003). In multivariable analysis, every unit increase in the number of health care providers available increased the likelihood of screening by 1% (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.01). In addition, seeing a nurse/midwife compared to a medical doctor reduced the likelihood of screening by 87% (OR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.42). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cost issues (affordability component) and other patient level factors (captured in the acceptability, accessibility and accommodation components) were less important predictors of screening compared with availability of physicians in this population. Meeting cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination goals will require significant investments in the health care workforce, improving health care worker density in poor and rural areas, and improved training of the existing workforce.",0
1437,"INTRODUCTION: The study was conducted to determine the challenges and suggest solutions to conducting free cervical cancer screening among Nigerian women. METHODS: Awareness was created among women groups and mass media in Osun State for women to undergo free cervical cancer screening programme. Consenting women had their socio-demographic characteristics, awareness and uptake of HPV vaccine documented and papanicolaou smear procedure done with adequate referral for treatment given where necessary. RESULTS: A total of 287 women had cervical cancer screening. Mean (SD) age was 51.6 (14.3) years. Most participants were urban based (87.1%), married (63.1%), had secondary education (39%) and were traders (79.1%). None of the women were aware of the preventive HPV vaccine or had been vaccinated against HPV. About 6% were pre-invasive while 0.7% had invasive cervical cancer. The highest proportions of respondents affected were young, married and had lower education. Challenges identified included poor attendance, low risk perception and logistic issues. CONCLUSION: Most participants were urban based. There is need to decentralize cancer of cervix screening through mobile clinics and establishment of screening centres in the rural areas. Neighbour to neighbour sensitization is essential. Also, HPV vaccine should be available and affordable to all girls before sexual maturity.",0
1438,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer prevention using cervical cytology is insufficiently sensitive, a significant proportion of HPV-infected women having normal cytology. The objective of the present study was to try to identify factors associated with abnormal cytology in HPV-infected women living in remote areas of French Guiana. METHODS: A study was conducted in women aged 20-65 years having HPV infections confirmed by HPV DNA detection using the GREINER-BIO-ONE kit. In addition to HPV testing, cytology was performed and classified as normal or abnormal. Demographic and life history variables, and infecting genotypes were compared between the normal and abnormal cytology groups. RESULTS: None of the demographic and life history variables were associated with cytology results. HPV genotype 53 was significantly associated with absence of cytological abnormalities whereas HPV 52, 58, 16 and perhaps 33 and 66 were independently associated with a greater risk of cytological abnormalities. When grouping HPV genotypes in different species, only species 9 (HPV 16, 31, 33, 35, 52, 58, 67) was significantly associated with abnormal cytology AOR = 5.1 (95% CI = 2.3-11.2), P < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: It was not possible to predict which HPV-infected women will have cytological abnormalities or notfrom anamnesis. In this study HPV 53 seemed more benign than other HPV genotypes. On the contrary, species n°9, containing 5 of the genotypes contained in the nonavalent HPV vaccine, was significantly associated with more cytological abnormalities. HPV testing and vaccination with the nonavalent vaccine should be implemented in these remote parts of French Guiana.",0
1439,"Peru struggles to prevent cervical cancer (CC). In the jungle, prevention programs suffer from significant barriers although technology exists to detect CC precursors. This study used community based participatory research (CBPR) methods to overcome barriers. The objective was to evaluate the utility of CBPR techniques in a mother-child screen/treat and vaccinate program for CC prevention in the Peruvian jungle. The CC prevention program used self-sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) for screening, cryotherapy for treatment and the HPV vaccine Gardasil for vaccination. Community health leaders (HL) from around Iquitos participated in a two half day educational course. The HLs then decided how to implement interventions in their villages or urban sectors. The success of the program was measured by: (1) ability of the HLs to determine an implementation plan, (2) proper use of research forms, (3) participation and retention rates, and (4) participants' satisfaction. HLs successfully registered 320 women at soup kitchens, schools, and health posts. Screening, treatment, and vaccination were successfully carried out using forms for registration, consent, and results with minimum error. In the screen/treat intervention 100% of participants gave an HPV sample and 99.7% reported high satisfaction; 81% of HPV + women were treated, and 57% returned for 6-month followup. Vaccine intervention: 98% of girls received the 1st vaccine, 88% of those received the 2nd, and 65% the 3rd. CBPR techniques successfully helped implement a screen/treat and vaccinate CC prevention program around Iquitos, Peru. These techniques may be appropriate for large-scale preventive health-care interventions.",0
1441,"AIMS: Analyze the relationship between obesity and influenza. METHODS: Basal hormone milieu, defective response of both innate and adaptive immune system and sedentariness are major determinants in the severity of influenza viral infection in obese patients. Being overweight not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but a large prevalence of obese individuals within the population might increase the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually might increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic. RESULTS: Waiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary interventions. Nonetheless, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following interventions aimed at improving immune response: (1) lose weight with a mild caloric restriction; (2) include AMPK activators and PPAR gamma activators in the drug treatment for obesity associated with diabetes; and (3) practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Due to prolonged viral shedding, quarantine in obese subjects should likely be longer than normal weight individuals.",0

However, the global effect of this pandemic has been devastating. Billions of people are in lockdown and isolation on six continents around the world. Most have easy access to information due to internet connectivity and electronic media, which has helped share information about the pandemic. However, information overload during the current COVID-19 pandemic has posed a set of challenges not encountered before. There is an ""infodemic"" in which false news, conspiracy theories, magical cures and racist news are being shared at an alarming rate, with the potential to increase anxiety and stress and even lead to loss of life.

1443,"Since its emergence in December 2019, the virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has quickly caused a pandemic. This virus causes a disease now known as coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. As an increasing proportion of the at-risk population becomes infected, and patients with severe illness are hospitalized, it is essential for hospitalists to remain current on how to best care for people with suspected or confirmed disease. Establishing a system for logistical planning, and accurate information sharing is strongly recommended. Infection control remains the ultimate goal. As such, health care workers should be educated on universal and isolation precautions, and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment. Social distancing should be encouraged to prevent the spread of infection, and creative and innovative ways to reduce contact may need to be considered. Moreover, it is imperative to prepare for contingencies as medical staff will inevitably get sick or become unavailable. Hospitalists have the difficult task of caring for patients while also adapting to the many logistical and social elements of a pandemic.",0
1444,"Infection by coronavirus (CoV-19) has led to emergence of a pandemic called as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) that has so far affected about 210 countries. The dynamic data indicate that the pandemic by CoV-19 so far has infected 2,403,963 individuals, and among these 624,698 have recovered while, it has been fatal for 165,229. Without much experience, currently, the medicines that are clinically being evaluated for COVID-19 include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, lopinavir, ritonavir, tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Therefore, countries such as Italy, USA, Spain and France with the most advanced health care system are partially successful to control CoV-19 infection. India being the 2nd largest populous country, where, the healthcare system is underdeveloped, major portion of population follow unhygienic lifestyle, is able to restrict the rate of both infection and death of its citizens from COVID-19. India has followed an early and a very strict social distancing by lockdown and has issued advisory to clean hands regularly by soap and/or by alcohol based sterilizers. Rolling data on the global index of the CoV infection is 13,306, and the index of some countries such as USA (66,148), Italy (175,055), Spain (210,126), France (83,363) and Switzerland (262,122) is high. The index of India has remained very low (161) so far, mainly due to early implementation of social lockdown, social distancing, and sanitizing hands. However, articles on social lockdown as a preventive measure against COVID-19 in PubMed are scanty. It has been observed that social lockdown has also drastic impacts on the environment especially on reduction of NO2 and CO2 emission. Slow infection rate under strict social distancing will offer time to researchers to come up with exact medicines/vaccines against CoV-19. Therefore, it is concluded that stringent social distancing via lockdown is highly important to control COVID-19 and also to contribute for self-regeneration of nature.",0

Widespread social isolation and restrictions in the age of modern communicative technology, coupled with some early successes for makers, have united the open-source community towards a common goal in a way not previously seen. Local hospitals and care facilities are turning to makers to print essential consumable parts, such as simple visors, while in the hardest hit areas, critical pieces of medical technology are being fabricated. While important and effective innovations are appearing almost daily, there are also some worrying trends towards hobbyists attempting manufacture of complex medical devices with little understanding of the clinical or scientific rationale behind their design. The nature of the open-source community, an area of intensive innovation, fluidity, and experimentation, jars with the exacting standards of medical device regulation. Here, we review the involvement of rapid prototyping and the open-source community in the key areas of personal protective equipment (PPE), diagnostics, critical care technology, and information acquisition and sharing, highlighting where makers and hackers have clashed with medical device regulations, and areas where the system has worked well to facilitate change.",0

1449,": The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is rapidly progressing globally, and Italy, as one of the main pandemic hotspots, may provide some hard lessons for other countries. In this paper, we summarize the current organizational capacity and provide a pragmatic and narrative account of strategies and activities implemented by the Department of Prevention (Dipartimento di Prevenzione)-the regional entity of the Local Health Authority of the Italian National Health Service in charge of public health-since the beginning of the outbreak. We conduct a preliminary analysis of general strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of the response strategies from a local perspective. Furthermore, we provide firsthand insights on future directions and priorities to manage this unprecedented pandemic. Our case report gives a qualitative view of the healthcare response, based on the experience of frontline professionals, with the aim to generate hypotheses about factors which may promote or hinder the prevention and management of a pandemic locally.

1450,"COVID-19's daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions. This study aims to analyze the effect of lockdown days on the spread of coronavirus in countries. COVID-19 cases and lockdown days data were collected for 49 countries that implemented the lockdown between certain dates (without interruption). The correlation tests were used for data analysis based on unconstrained (normal) and constrained (Tukey-lambda). The lockdown days was significantly correlated with COVID-19 pandemic based on unconstrained (r = -0.9126, F-ratio = 6.1654; t-ratio = 2.40; prob > .0203 with 49 observations) and based on Tukey-lambda (r = 0.7402, λ = 0.14). The lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions, has been observed to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, and showed that the spread of the virus can be significantly reduced by this preventive restriction in this study. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown. The application of lockdown by governments is also thought to be effective on psychology, environment and economy besides having impact on Covid-19.",0

1453,"Objectives: In 2020, the COVID-19 respiratory infection is spreading in Korea. In order to prevent the spread of an infectious disease, infected people must be quickly identified and isolated, and contact with the infected must be blocked early. This study attempted to verify the intervention effects on the spread of an infectious disease by using these measures in a mathematical model. Methods: We used the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovery (SIR) model for a virtual population group connected by a special structured network. In the model, the infected state (I) was divided into I in which the infection is undetected and I_x in which the infection is detected. The probability of transitioning from an I state to I_x can be viewed as the rate at which an infected person is found. We assumed that only those connected to each other in the network can cause infection. In addition, this study attempted to evaluate the effects of isolation by temporarily removing the connection among these people. Results: In Scenario 1, only the infected are isolated; in Scenario 2, those who are connected to an infected person and are also found to be infected are isolated as well. In Scenario 3, everyone connected to an infected person are isolated. In Scenario 3, it was possible to effectively suppress the infectious disease even with a relatively slow rate of diagnosis and relatively high infection rate. Conclusion: During the epidemic, quick identification of the infected is helpful. In addition, it was possible to quantitatively show through a simulation evaluation that the management of infected individuals as well as those who are connected greatly helped to suppress the spread of infectious diseases.",0
1454,"BACKGROUND: In December, 2019, the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing COVID-19, a respiratory disease presenting with fever, cough, and often pneumonia. WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates. METHODS: A case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for ≥15 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts). High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms. We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods. Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs. FINDINGS: Patient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons. 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations. Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4. The median incubation period was 4·0 days (IQR 2·3-4·3) and the median serial interval was 4·0 days (3·0-5·0). Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown. One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase. Secondary attack rates were 75·0% (95% CI 19·0-99·0; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10·0% (1·2-32·0; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5·1% (2·6-8·9; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts. INTERPRETATION: Although patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial. Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred. These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.

1455,"Italy was one of the first European countries affected by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, with over 105,000 infected people and close to 13,000 deaths, until March 31st. The pandemic has hit especially hard because of the country's demographic structure, with a high percentage of older adults. The authors explore the possibility, recently aired in some studies, of extensive intergenerational contact as a possible determinant of the severity of the pandemic among the older Italian adults. We analyzed several variables to test this hypothesis, such as the percentage of infected patients aged >80 years, available nursing home beds, COVID-19 incidence rate, and the number of days from when the number of positive tests exceeded 50 (epidemic maturity). We also included in the analysis mean household size and percentage of households comprising one person, in the region. Paradoxically, the results are opposite of what was previously reported. The pandemic was more severe in regions with higher family fragmentation and increased availability of residential health facilities.",0
1457,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 caused by a new form of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first appeared in China end of 2019 and quickly spread to all counties of the world. To slow down the spread of the virus and to limit the pressure on the health care systems, different regulations and recommendations have been implemented by authorities, comprising amongst others the closure of all entertainment venues and social distancing. These measures have received mixed reactions, particularly from young individuals, with many not following available advice. Drawing on the information in social media discussion forums, the present study explores the reasons why people ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities and why the authorities are unable to produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Three open-access social media forums (Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube comments) were systematically searched with respect to COVID-19-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours of individuals. The data was retrieved in the first 3 weeks of March 2020. Qualitative document analysis and qualitative content analysis were used as the methodical approach. The data was reviewed by all authors and jointly interpreted to minimise inconsistencies. RESULTS: The study reveals that reasons such as information pollution on social media, the persistence of uncertainty about the rapidly spreading virus, the impact of the social environment on the individual, and fear of unemployment associated with inequality in the distribution of income lead people to ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities. The findings suggest that government representatives and politicians could not produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak, due to not building trust among the public and taking concrete economic steps to satisfy them. CONCLUSION: In uncertain crises, transparency in the presentation of information and government policies emerge as influential determinants in creating social susceptibility and solidarity. The differences between social classes constitute one of the important factors that affect the decision-making mechanisms of individuals in determining the necessary steps to be undertaken in times of crisis.",0
1458,"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents major challenges to places of detention, including secure forensic hospitals. International guidance presents a range of approaches to assist in decreasing the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks as well as responses to manage outbreaks of infection should they occur. METHODS: We conducted a literature search on pandemic or outbreak management in forensic mental health settings, including gray literature sources, from 2000 to April 2020. We describe the evolution of a COVID-19 outbreak in our own facility, and the design, and staffing of a forensic isolation unit. RESULTS: We found a range of useful guidance but no published experience of implementing these approaches. We experienced outbreaks of COVID-19 on two secure forensic units with 13 patients and 10 staff becoming positive. One patient died. The outbreaks lasted for 41 days on each unit from declaration to resolution. We describe the approaches taken to reduction of infection risk, social distancing and changes to the care delivery model. CONCLUSIONS: Forensic secure settings present major challenges as some proposals for pandemic management such as decarceration or early release are not possible, and facilities may present challenges to achieve sustained social distancing. Assertive testing, cohorting, and isolation units are appropriate responses to these challenges.",0
1459,"The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with increasing morbidity and mortality and has impacted the lives of the global populations. Human behavior and knowledge assessment during the crisis are critical in the overall efforts to contain the outbreak. To assess knowledge, attitude, perceptions, and precautionary measures toward COVID-19 among a sample of medical students in Jordan. This is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted between the 16th and 19th of March 2020. Participants were students enrolled in different levels of study at the six medical schools in Jordan. An online questionnaire which was posted on online platforms was used. The questionnaire consisted of four main sections: socio-demographics, sources of information, knowledge attitudes, and precautionary measures regarding COVID-19. Medical students used mostly social media (83.4%) and online search engines (84.8%) as their preferred source of information on COVID-19 and relied less on medical search engines (64.1%). Most students believed that hand shaking (93.7%), kissing (94.7%), exposure to contaminated surfaces (97.4%), and droplet inhalation (91.0%) are the primary mode of transmission but were indecisive regarding airborne transmission with only 41.8% in support. Participants also reported that elderly with chronic illnesses are the most susceptible group for the coronavirus infection (95.0%). As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic more than 80.0% of study participants adopted social isolation strategies, regular hand washing, and enhanced personal hygiene measures as their first line of defense against the virus. In conclusion, Jordanian medical students showed expected level of knowledge about the COVID-19 virus and implemented proper strategies to prevent its spread.",0
1461,"A pandemic of a novel Coronavirus emerged in December of 2019 (COVID-19), causing devastating public health impact across the world. In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation, and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by ℛc), is less than unity. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distancing measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy ≥ 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19. Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19. Using face-masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high. The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy.",0
1462,"The current worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought some medical systems to the brink of collapse. This crisis is also negatively impacting the care of patients with non-COVID-19 conditions, including those with cerebellar ataxia (CA). Older patients with CA and those with immune-mediated ataxias on immunosuppressive medication are potentially at high risk of developing serious complications of the infection, although it is also possible that immunosuppressive agents may provide a defense against cytokine storm. This has implications for even greater attention to preventing contracting the disease through physical distancing and/or isolation. The CA patient population is also at higher risk because of the neurological complexities of their underlying disorder and the comorbid medical illnesses that often accompany the genetic ataxias. As the disruption of social patterns and healthcare delivery in response to the crisis continues, interruption of rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and face-to-face consultations threatens to have a negative impact on the course and well-being of CA patients. Mental and physical health is also potentially at greater risk because the prevailing uncertainty and anxiety may be superimposed upon cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges. We identify and review some of the short- and long-term consequences of this global pandemic for the community of ataxia patients and their families and for the clinical and academic neurologists/ataxiologists caring for these patients. This includes the recognition that telemedicine has emerged as a principle means of caregiver-patient contact and that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including those specific to cerebellar neurobiology are increasingly recognized and will require close surveillance and monitoring. This COVID-19 Cerebellum Task Force consensus provides some guidance on how we may approach this uncertain time and consider preparing for the new realities we face in CA patient care once this acute crisis has passed.",0
1463,"The year 2020 started with a report about a cluster of pneumonia cases from Wuhan, China, that were later identified to be caused by the novel coronavirus. By March 11, this outbreak was designated as a pandemic by World Health Organization. So far, it has affected 213 countries and territories around the world. It is an infectious disease (R0: 2.2 to 3.3) with confirmed human-to-human transmission. The high morbidity and mortality attributed to viral infection has overwhelmed the health systems of most countries across the globe. As of now, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine against COVID-19. The current pharmacological management relies only on supportive care. Therefore, only non-pharmacological approaches are left to protect people from infection. Established preventive methods against infection include dodging the exposure from the virus, which will break the chain of transmission and prevent further human-to-human spread. In the present paper, we discuss the various non-pharmacological approaches that have to be adopted at the personal or community level and by the healthcare providers to win against this virus.",0
1464,"The ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) epidemic continues to have a global impact. This article describes the author's experience providing nursing care to a female patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning to Taiwan from overseas. During the patient's period of isolation (February 5th to February 29th, 2020), the author used Roy's adaptation model to perform first-level holistic physical, psychological, and social nursing assessments and collected health-problem information using face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and observations via a remote monitoring system. A second level of assessment confirmed that the problems faced by the patient included (1) existing infections related to COVID-19 and (2) anxiety related to uncertainties about disease prognosis, forgiveness from the family, and potential violations of personal privacy by the media. Due to the special nature of the isolation ward, the author used a remote physiological monitoring system to monitor the vital signs, fever, and shortness of breath status of the patient to quickly decrease her physical discomfort and to improve her self-care ability during hospitalization. Environmental cleanliness was strictly maintained to reduce the risk of cross-infection and ensure patient safety. To alleviate patient anxiety, the author established a good therapeutic interpersonal relationship with the patient by making 10-60 minutes of caring calls to her each day, by providing individual care measures, and by using the Internet to play audio and video to teach mindfulness meditation. Caring for COVID-19 cases is a completely new experience. The author hopes that this experience may be used as a reference for caregivers.",0
1467,"The recent pandemic SARS-CoV-2 outbreak affects all kinds of individuals worldwide. The health, social, and economic impacts of the pandemic are dramatic, and vaccines or specific treatment options are not yet available. The only approaches that we currently have available to stop the epidemic are those of classical epidemic control, such as case isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, physical distancing, and hygiene measures. It is therefore essential to find further preventive measures and possible interventions that can slow down the number of infected individuals and decrease the severity of disease when affected by SARS-CoV-2. It seems that epigenetic mechanisms are an important part of the pathophysiology and illness severity of COVID-19. These mechanisms have been identified in SARS-CoV-2 but also in other viral infections. If and when these mechanisms are confirmed, then epigenetic interventions influencing DNA methylation could be indicated as primary and/or secondary preventive options.",0
1469,": The COVID-19 health crisis joined, rather than supplanted, the opioid crisis as the most acutely pressing threats to US public health. In the setting of COVID-19, opioid use disorder treatment paradigms are being disrupted, including the fact that methadone clinics are scrambling to give ""take-home"" doses where they would typically not. The rapid transition away from in-person examination, dosing and group therapy in an era of social isolation calls for adjustments to clinical practice, including emphasizing patient-provider communication, favoring new inductees on buprenorphine and leveraging technology to optimize safety of medication treatment.",0
1470,"The COVID-19 crisis continues. Worldwide, there have been roughly 6.3 million cases and 380,000 deaths. In the United States, at the time of this writing, there were 106,200 deaths. As life has changed on many fronts, some predictable effects of the pandemic have occurred, including socioeconomic hardships, social isolation, and political unease. Although the intensity of the need for effective treatments and a vaccine is ongoing, other issues have arisen that were not widely anticipated in the early days of the pandemic. Several of these consequences have brought a focus on issues that are at the heart of oncology nursing.",0
1471,"Background: Social media has become an increasingly important tool in monitoring the onset and spread of infectious diseases globally as well monitoring the spread of information about those diseases. This includes the spread of misinformation, which has been documented within the context of the emerging COVID-19 crisis. Understanding the creation, spread and uptake of social media misinformation is of critical importance to public safety. In this descriptive study, we detail Twitter activity regarding spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and claims it increases, or ""boosts"", immunity. Spinal manipulation is a common intervention used by many health professions, most commonly by chiropractors. There is no clinical evidence that SMT improves human immunity. Methods: Social media searching software (Talkwalker Quick Search) was used to describe Twitter activity regarding SMT and improving or boosting immunity. Searches were performed for the 3 months and 12 months before March 31, 2020 using terms related to 1) SMT, 2) the professions that most often provide SMT and 3) immunity. From these searches, we determined the magnitude and time course of Twitter activity then coded this activity into content that promoted or refuted a SMT/immunity link. Content themes, high-influence users and user demographics were then stratified as either promoting or refuting this linkage. Results: Twitter misinformation regarding a SMT/immunity link increased dramatically during the onset of the COVID crisis. Activity levels (number of tweets) and engagement scores (likes + retweets) were roughly equal between content promoting or refuting a SMT/immunity link, however, the potential reach (audience) of tweets refuting a SMT/immunity link was 3 times higher than those promoting a link. Users with the greatest influence on Twitter, as either promoters or refuters, were individuals, not institutions or organizations. The majority of tweets promoting a SMT/immunity link were generated in the USA while the majority of refuting tweets originated from Canada. Conclusion: Twitter activity about SMT and immunity increased during the COVID-19 crisis. Results from this work have the potential to help policy makers and others understand the impact of SMT misinformation and devise strategies to mitigate its impact.",0
1473,"The pandemic outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread all over the world in a short period of time. Efficient identification of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been one of the most important tasks to facilitate all the following counter measurements in dealing with the infectious disease. In Taiwan, a COVID-19 Open Science Platform adheres to the spirit of open science: sharing sources, data, and methods to promote progress in academic research while corroborating findings from various disciplines has established in mid-February 2020, for collaborative research in support of the development of detection methods, therapeutics, and a vaccine for COVID-19. Research priorities include infection control, epidemiology, clinical characterization and management, detection methods (including viral RNA detection, viral antigen detection, and serum antibody detection), therapeutics (neutralizing antibody and small molecule drugs), vaccines, and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. In addition, research on social ethics and the law are included to take full account of the impact of the COVID-19 virus.",0
1474,"BACKGROUND: The challenges faced by the Global South during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic are compounded by the presence of informal settlements, which are typically densely populated and lacking in formalized sanitation infrastructure. Social distancing measures in informal settlements may be difficult to implement due to the density and layout of settlements. This study measures the distance between dwellings in informal settlements in Cape Town to identify the risk of COVID-19 transmission. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to determine if social distancing measures are achievable in informal settlements in Cape Town, using two settlements as an example. We will first examine the distance between dwellings and their first, second, and third nearest neighbors and then identify clusters of dwellings in which residents would be unable to effectively practice social isolation due to the close proximity of their homes. METHODS: Dwellings in the settlements of Masiphumelele and Klipfontein Glebe were extracted from a geographic information system data set of outlines of all informal dwellings in Cape Town. The distance to each dwelling's first, second, and third nearest neighbors was calculated for each settlement. A social distance measure of 2 m was used (buffer of 1 m, as dwellings less than 2 m apart are joined) to identify clusters of dwellings that are unable to effectively practice social distancing in each settlement. RESULTS: The distance to each dwelling's first 3 nearest neighbors illustrates that the settlement of Masiphumelele is constructed in a denser fashion as compared to the Klipfontein Glebe settlement. This implies that implementing social distancing will likely be more challenging in Masiphumelele than in Klipfontein Glebe. However, using a 2-m social distancing measure, it was demonstrated that large portions of Klipfontein Glebe would also be unable to effectively implement social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Effectively implementing social distancing may be a challenge in informal settlements due to their density. This paper uses dwelling outlines for informal settlements in the city of Cape Town to demonstrate that with a 2 m measure, effective social distancing will be challenging.",0
1475,"Nepal is a landlocked country bordering two most populous countries, India and China. Nepal shares open border with India from three sides, east, south and west. And, in north with China, where the novel coronavirus infection (CVOVID-19) began in late December 2019. The first confirmed imported case in Nepal was reported in 2nd week of January 2020. The initial response of Nepal to COVID-19 were comparably slow but country geared efforts after it was declared a 'global pandemic' by WHO on 11 March, 2020. Government of Nepal's steps from 18 March, 2020 led to partial lock down and countrywide lockdown imposed on 24 March, 2020. Government devised comprehensive plan on 27 March, 2020 for quarantine for peoples who arrived in Nepal from COVID-19 affected countries. This article covers summary of global status, South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) status, and Nepal's response to contain COVID-19 infection discussed under three headings: Steps taken before and after WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and lab services regarding detection of COVID-19. Nepal has documented five confirmed cases of COVID-19 till the end of March 2020, first in second week of 15 January, 2020 and 2nd case 8-weeks thereafter and 3rd case two days later, 4th on 27 March and 5th on 28 March. Four more cases detected during first week of April. Non-Pharmacological interventions like social distancing and excellent personal habits are widely practiced. Country has to enhance testing and strengthen tracing, isolation and quarantine mechanism and care of COVID-19 patients as Nepal is in risk zone because of comparably weak health system and porous borders with India. The time will tell regarding further outbreak and how it will be tackled. Keywords: COVID-19; lockdown; Nepal; pandemic; response.",0
1477,"Several Italian towns are under lockdown to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. The level of transmission reduction required for physical distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a crucial question. We show that very high adherence to community quarantine (total stay-home policy) and a small household size is necessary for curbing the outbreak in a locked-down town. The larger the household size and amount of time in the public, the longer the lockdown period needed.",0
1478,"Sanitary Emergency Measures (SEM) were implemented in Mexico on March 30th, 2020 requiring the suspension of non-essential activities. This action followed a Healthy Distance Sanitary action on March 23rd, 2020. The aim of both measures was to reduce community transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico by lowering the effective contact rate. Using a modification of the Kermack-McKendrick SEIR model we explore the effect of behavioral changes required to lower community transmission by introducing a time-varying contact rate, and the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to suspension of non-essential activities. Our study shows that there exists a trade-off between the proportion of the population under SEM and the average time an individual is committed to all the behavioral changes needed to achieve an effective social distancing. This trade-off generates an optimum value for the proportion of the population under strict mitigation measures, significantly below 1 in some cases, that minimizes maximum COVID-19 incidence. We study the population-level impact of three key factors: the implementation of behavior change control measures, the time horizon necessary to reduce the effective contact rate and the proportion of people under SEM in combating COVID-19. Our model is fitted to the available data. The initial phase of the epidemic, from February 17th to March 23rd, 2020, is used to estimate the contact rates, infectious periods and mortality rate using both confirmed cases (by date of symptoms initiation), and daily mortality. Data on deaths after March 23rd, 2020 is used to estimate the mortality rate after the mitigation measures are implemented. Our simulations indicate that the most likely dates for maximum incidence are between late May and early June, 2020 under a scenario of high SEM compliance and low SEM abandonment rate.",0
1479,"Importance: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused epidemic spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Seattle, Washington, metropolitan area, with morbidity and mortality concentrated among residents of skilled nursing facilities. The prevalence of COVID-19 among older adults in independent/assisted living is not understood. Objectives: To conduct surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and describe symptoms of COVID-19 among residents and staff of an independent/assisted living community. Design, Setting, and Participants: In March 2020, public health surveillance of staff and residents was conducted on site at an assisted and independent living residence for older adults in Seattle, Washington, after exposure to 2 residents who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Exposures: Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a congregate setting implementing social isolation and infection prevention protocols. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs from residents and staff; a symptom questionnaire was completed assessing fever, cough, and other symptoms for the preceding 14 days. Residents were retested for SARS-CoV-2 7 days after initial screening. Results: Testing was performed on 80 residents; 62 were women (77%), with mean age of 86 (range, 69-102) years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 3 of 80 residents (3.8%); none felt ill, 1 male resident reported resolved cough and 1 loose stool during the preceding 14 days. Virus was also detected in 2 of 62 staff (3.2%); both were symptomatic. One week later, resident SARS-CoV-2 testing was repeated and 1 new infection detected (asymptomatic). All residents remained in isolation and were clinically stable 14 days after the second test. Conclusions and Relevance: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic residents highlights challenges in protecting older adults living in congregate settings. In this study, symptom screening failed to identify residents with infections and all 4 residents with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic after 14 days. Although 1 asymptomatic infection was found on retesting, a widespread facility outbreak was avoided. Compared with skilled nursing settings, in assisted/independent living communities, early surveillance to identify asymptomatic persons among residents and staff, in combination with adherence to recommended preventive strategies, may reduce viral spread.",0
1480,"The novel coronavirus pandemic, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has placed an immense strain on healthcare systems across the entire world. Consequently, multiple federal and state governments have placed restrictions on hospitals such as limiting ""elective surgery"" and recommending social or physical distancing. We review the literature on several areas that have been affected including surgical selection, inpatient care, and physician well-being. These areas affecting inpatient paradigms include surgical priority, physical or social distancing, file sharing for online clinical communications, and physician wellness. During this crisis, it is important that orthopaedic departments place an emphasis on personnel safety and slowing the spread of the virus so that the department can still maintain vital functions. Physical distancing and emerging technologies such as inpatient telemedicine and online file sharing applications can enable orthopaedic programs to still function while attempting to protect medical staff and patients from the novel coronavirus spread. This literature review sought to provide evidence-based guidance to orthopaedic departments during an unprecedented time. Orthopaedic surgeons should follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when appropriate, have teams created using physical distancing, understand the department's policy on elective surgery, and engage in routines which enhance physician wellness.",0
1481,"OBJECTIVES: Daily numbers of COVID-19 in Singapore from March to May 2020, the cause of a surge in cases in April and the national response were examined, and regulations on migrant worker accommodation studied. METHODS: Information was gathered from daily reports provided by the Ministry of Health, Singapore Statues online and a Ministerial statement given at a Parliament sitting on 4 May 2020. RESULTS: A marked escalation in the daily number of new COVID-19 cases was seen in early April 2020. The majority of cases occurred among an estimated 295 000 low-skilled migrant workers living in foreign worker dormitories. As of 6 May 2020, there were 17 758 confirmed COVID-19 cases among dormitory workers (88% of 20 198 nationally confirmed cases). One dormitory housing approximately 13 000 workers had 19.4% of residents infected. The national response included mobilising several government agencies and public volunteers. There was extensive testing of workers in dormitories, segregation of healthy and infected workers, and daily observation for fever and symptoms. Twenty-four dormitories were declared as 'isolation areas', with residents quarantined for 14 days. New housing, for example, vacant public housing flats, military camps, exhibition centres, floating hotels have been provided that will allow for appropriate social distancing. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted migrant workers as a vulnerable occupational group. Ideally, matters related to inadequate housing of vulnerable migrant workers need to be addressed before a pandemic.",0
1482,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infected over 3300 healthcare workers in early 2020 in China. Little information is known about nosocomial infections of healthcare workers in the initial period. We analysed data from healthcare workers with nosocomial infections in Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) and their family members. METHODS: We collected and analysed data on exposure history, illness timelines and epidemiological characteristics from 25 healthcare workers with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and two healthcare workers in whom COVID-19 was highly suspected, as well as 10 of their family members with COVID-19, between 5 January and 12 February 2020. The demographics and clinical features of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases were investigated and viral RNA of 12 cases was sequenced and analysed. RESULTS: Nine clusters were found among the patients. All patients showed mild to moderate clinical manifestation and recovered without deterioration. The mean period of incubation was 4.5 days, the mean±sd clinical onset serial interval (COSI) was 5.2±3.2 days, and the median virus shedding time was 18.5 days. Complete genomic sequences of 12 different coronavirus strains demonstrated that the viral structure, with small irrelevant mutations, was stable in the transmission chains and showed remarkable traits of infectious traceability. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly transmitted from person to person, regardless of whether they have symptoms, in both hospital settings and social activities, based on the short period of incubation and COSI. The public health service should take practical measures to curb the spread, including isolation of cases, tracing close contacts, and containment of severe epidemic areas. Besides this, healthcare workers should be alert during the epidemic and self-quarantine if self-suspected of infection.",0
1484,"AIM: In addition to respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 can present with gastrointestinal complaints suggesting possible faeco-oral transmission. The primary aim of this review was to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature review identified studies describing COVID-19 patients tested for faecal virus. Search terms for MEDLINE included 'clinical', 'faeces', 'gastrointestinal secretions', 'stool', 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2' and '2019-nCoV'. Additional searches were done in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, Gastroenterology, Gut, Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the World Health Organization Database, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, social media and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints. Data were extracted concerning the type of test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco-oral transmission of the virus. RESULTS: Twenty-six relevant articles were identified. Combining study results demonstrated that 53.9% of those tested for faecal RNA were positive. The duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33 days after a negative nasopharyngeal swab with one result remaining positive 47 days after onset of symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is transmitted via faecally shed virus. CONCLUSION: There is a high rate of positive polymerase chain reaction tests with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal samples of patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and the degree of transmission through the faeco-oral route. This may have important implications on isolation, recommended precautions and protective equipment for interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.",0
1485,"The first cases of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China, and rapidly become a public health emergency of international proportions. The disease may cause mild-to-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, sore throat, and headache. This article is a narrative review with the aim of analyzing the current literature on postviral olfactory dysfunction (OD) related to SARS-CoV-2 pandemics. Since the initial anecdotal reports from China, international reports on COVID-19 patients have been increasing, describing a 5% to 85% range of loss of smell. To date, the literature is widely heterogeneous regarding the loss of smell; therefore, we advise home isolation measures and/or social distancing, and to carry out diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 when possible in those patients with sudden and severe loss of smell who cannot be promptly evaluated.",0
1486,"There is debate as to whether olfactory dysfunction should be considered a symptom of COVID-19 infection. We undertook a systematic literature review of the articles indexed in PubMed on olfactory disorders in viral respiratory tract conditions, with special emphasis on COVID-19. The main objective was to find evidence of clinical interest to support the relationship between anosmia and COVID-19. Olfactory disorders in upper respiratory tract infections are frequent, most caused by obstruction due to oedema of the nasal mucosa. Occasionally, post-viral sensorineural olfactory dysfunction occurs, with a variable prognosis. The evidence on anosmia in COVID-19 patients is extremely limited, corresponding to a level 5 or D of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. According to the available evidence, it seems reasonable to apply isolation, hygiene and social distancing measures in patients with recent olfactory disorders as the only symptom, although the usefulness of diagnostic tests for this type of patient should be studied.",0
1487,"BACKGROUND: Many healthcare workers were infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) early in the epidemic posing a big challenge for epidemic control. Hence, this study aims to explore perceived infection routes, influencing factors, psychosocial changes, and management procedures for COVID-19 infected healthcare workers. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, single hospital-based study. We recruited all 105 confirmed COVID-19 healthcare workers in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from February 15 to 29, 2020. All participants completed a validated questionnaire. Electronic consent was obtained from all participants. Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured. RESULTS: Finally, 103 professional staff with COVID-19 finished the questionnaire and was included (response rate: 98.1%). Of them, 87 cases (84.5%) thought they were infected in working environment in hospital, one (1.0%) thought their infection was due to the laboratory environment, and 5 (4.9%) thought they were infected in daily life or community environment. Swab of throat collection and physical examination were the procedures perceived as most likely causing their infection by nurses and doctors respectively. Forty-three (41.8%) thought their infection was related to protective equipment, utilization of common equipment (masks and gloves). The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%). After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes. Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms. CONCLUSION: The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases. Positive psychological intervention is necessary.",0
1488,"An ongoing apocalyptic outbreak of a new virus causing pneumonia-like clusters in Wuhan city, China, has gleamed the world. The outbreak, confirmed on the New Year's Eve 2020, has known no boundaries since then. The number has surpassed that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and is uninterruptedly escalating. Being an RNA virus, it has a propensity to mutate due to the low proofreading capacity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Step-wise mutations have led to the gradual spillover of virus and after crossing the inter-species interface, the virus has adapted itself for a stable human-to-human transmission. The disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can prove deadlier if the so-called 'super-spreading events' emerge with time. Recent research has shown the maximum homology of 99% of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins associated coronavirus, owing to which these can serve as potential intermediate host. India is responding swiftly to the emergency situation, and the whole of the country is under lockdown since 25 March 2020, to ensure social distancing. All the international flights are padlocked and the travellers are being screened at airports and seaports via thermal sensors, and quarantine for a period of 14 days is recommended. Three hundred and forty-five patients across the country tested positive with six fatalities as of 22 March 2020. No specific anti-CoV drugs are currently available. Patients are being treated with protease drugs are inhibitors, remdesivir, chloroquine, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitors, ivermectin, sarilumab and tocilizumab, though none of these is Food and Drug Administration approved and are undergoing trials. Preventive measures such as social distancing, quarantine, cough etiquettes, proper hand washing, cleaning and decontaminating the surfaces are the mainstay for curbing the transmission of this virus. The present review highlights the update of novel SARS-CoV-2 in context to the Indian scenario.",0

1490,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly pathogenic viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Currently, COVID-19 has caused global health concern. It is assumed that COVID-19 has zoonotic origin based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet market in Wuhan City, China. The phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has significant sequence similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, thus bats could be primary possible reservoir. The intermediate host and there subsequent transfer is not known yet, although human to human transfer is widely confirmed. The transmission of COVID-19 infection from one person to another resulted in the isolation of patients who were subsequently given a variety of treatments. To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc. No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet. However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery. In this article emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection along with potential therapeutic strategies are analyzed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
1491,"Despite social distancing and shelter-in-place policies, COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States. A lack of timely information about factors influencing COVID-19 spread and testing has hampered agile responses to the pandemic. We developed How We Feel, an extensible web and mobile application that aggregates self-reported survey responses, to fill gaps in the collection of COVID-19-related data. How We Feel collects longitudinal and geographically localized information on users' health, behavior, and demographics. Here we report results from over 500,000 users in the United States from April 2, 2020 to May 12, 2020. We show that self- reported surveys can be used to build predictive models of COVID-19 test results, which may aid in identification of likely COVID-19 positive individuals. We find evidence among our users for asymptomatic or presymptomatic presentation, as well as for household and community exposure, occupation, and demographics being strong risk factors for COVID-19. We further reveal factors for which users have been SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested, as well as the temporal dynamics of self- reported symptoms and self-isolation behavior in positive and negative users. These results highlight the utility of collecting a diverse set of symptomatic, demographic, and behavioral self- reported data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
1492,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Hubei Province, China in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic, with hundreds of thousands of cases and over 165 countries affected. Primary routes of transmission of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are through respiratory droplets and close person-to-person contact. While information about other potential modes of transmission are relatively sparse, evidence supporting the possibility of a fecally mediated mode of transmission has been accumulating. Here, current knowledge on the potential for fecal transmission is briefly reviewed and the possible implications are discussed from a public health perspective.",0
1493,"Lockdown is essential for containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. It is the best measure to maintain extreme social distancing which has been effective in controlling the infection and saving lives. But they are causing huge loss economically, disrupting social life and causing distress around the world. Reopening too quickly or too boldly without a goal-oriented strategy could mean a second wave of infection as fierce or even worse as the first. The fundamentals of the virus remain the same - one infected person will, without a lockdown pass it onto three others on average. The consequences of lifting the lockdown are unforeseeable and the stakes are high. Due to the different spectrum of severity with same strain of virus and uncertainty of post lockdown era, lifting the lockdown will be a trial and error approach. Nevertheless, at some point the lockdown has to be lifted. The strategic approach would be innumerable testing, investigations, strong contact tracing, isolation and follow-up. In a low-income country like Nepal, this will mean negotiating a tricky balance between terminating the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and allowing people to recover their livelihoods before they slip into extreme poverty and anguish.",0
1494,"We analyze the process of infection rate growth and decline for the recent global pandemic, applying a new method to the available global data. We describe and utilize an original approach based on statistical physics to predict the societal transmission timescale and the universal recovery trajectory resulting from the countermeasures implemented in entire societies. We compare the whole-society infection growth rates for many countries and local regions, to illustrate the common physical and mathematical basis for the viral spread and infection rate reduction, and validate the theory and resulting correlations. We show that methods traditionally considered for the numerical analysis and the control of individual virus transmission (e.g. ℜ0 scaling) represent one special case of the theory, and also compare our results to the available IHME computer model outcomes. We proceed to illustrate several interesting features of the different approaches to the mitigation of the pandemic, related to social isolation and ""lockdown"" tactics. Finally, we use presently available data from many countries to make actual predictions of the time needed for securing minimum infection rates in the future, highlighting the differences that emerge between isolated ""islands"" and mobile cities, and identifying the desired overall recovery trajectory.",0
1495,"After the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, we estimated the distribution and scale of more than 5 million migrants residing in Wuhan after they returned to their hometown communities in Hubei Province or other provinces at the end of 2019 by using the data from the 2013-2018 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS). We found that the distribution of Wuhan's migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan's migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhan's total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhan's migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged and high-risk individuals. Their social characteristics include nuclear family migration (84%), migration with families of 3-4 members (71%), a rural household registration (85%), and working or doing business (84%) as the main reason for migration. Using a quasi-experimental analysis framework, we found that the size of Wuhan's migrants was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, we compared the epidemic situation in different regions and found that the number of confirmed cases in some provinces and cities in Hubei Province may be underestimated, while the epidemic situation in some regions has increased rapidly. The results are conducive to monitoring the epidemic prevention and control in various regions.",0
1496,"The spread of COVID-19 in the whole world has put the humanity at risk. The resources of some of the largest economies are stressed out due to the large infectivity and transmissibility of this disease. Due to the growing magnitude of number of cases and its subsequent stress on the administration and health professionals, some prediction methods would be required to predict the number of cases in future. In this paper, we have used data-driven estimation methods like long short-term memory (LSTM) and curve fitting for prediction of the number of COVID-19 cases in India 30 days ahead and effect of preventive measures like social isolation and lockdown on the spread of COVID-19. The prediction of various parameters (number of positive cases, number of recovered cases, etc.) obtained by the proposed method is accurate within a certain range and will be a beneficial tool for administrators and health officials.",0

Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which began to spread in December 2019, has created challenges in the management of elderly hip fracture patients, not only by influencing the choice of operation and postoperative rehabilitation methods, but also by generating new risks for the medical staff. During this period, our infection and orthopedic treatment unit in the center of the epidemic area effectively treated 82 elderly patients with hip fracture, and no cross-infection occurred. Therefore, our experience in prevention and treatment is worth recommending to frontline anti-epidemic personnel.",0
1500,"The COVID-19 global pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, and represents an urgent medical and social issue. Unfortunately, there is still not a single proven effective drug available, and therefore, current therapeutic guidelines recommend supportive care including oxygen administration and treatment with antibiotics. Recently, patients have been also treated with off-label therapies which comprise antiretrovirals, anti-inflammatory compounds, antiparasitic agents and plasma from convalescent patients, all with controversial results. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and plays a pivotal role in viral replication processes. In this review, we discuss several aspects of the UPS and the effects of its inhibition with particular regard to the life cycle of the coronaviruses (CoVs). In fact, proteasome inhibition by various chemical compounds, such as MG132, epoxomycin and bortezomib, may reduce the virus entry into the eucariotic cell, the synthesis of RNA, and the subsequent protein expression necessary for CoVs. Importantly, since UPS inhibitors reduce the cytokine storm associated with various inflammatory conditions, it is reasonable to assume that they might be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2, thus providing an additional tool to counteract both virus replication as well as its most deleterious consequences triggered by abnormal immunological response.",0
1502,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The impacts of the disease may be beyond the respiratory system, also affecting mental health. Several factors may be involved in the association between COVID-19 and psychiatric outcomes, such as fear inherent in the pandemic, adverse effects of treatments, as well as financial stress, and social isolation. Herein we discuss the growing evidence suggesting that the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and host may also trigger changes in brain and behavior. Based on the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it is conceivable that changes in endocrine and immune response in the periphery or in the central nervous system may be involved in the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and impaired mental health. This is likely to be further enhanced, since millions of people worldwide are isolated in quarantine to minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and social isolation can also lead to neuroendocrine-immune changes. Accordingly, we highlight here the hypothesis that neuroendocrine-immune interactions may be involved in negative impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection and social isolation on psychiatric issues.",0
1503,"Health literacy is the process of obtaining knowledge, motivation and individual competencies to understand and access information, express opinions and make decisions with respect to health promotion and maintenance. This applies in different contexts, environments, and throughout life. This conceptual perspective is very necessary in the face of the SARS-CoV-2 virus emergency. This virus produces the Covid-19 disease, which has become a pandemic of devastating effects not only healthwise, but also, importantly, from an economic, political and social point of view. This essay seeks to establish the scientific evidence-based elements that guide public policies for prevention and control. Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence. This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services 'capacity for medical attention and improving health services' ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents. All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community's participation as shared responsibility. Therefore, public health literacy is needed.",0
1504,"Background: Trends in contact with a high volume national digital mental health service (DMHS), the MindSpot Clinic, provide a unique opportunity to assess the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the ""comparison period"" (1 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the ""COVID-19 pandemic"" (19 March to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (n = 1650) and the COVID-19 period (n = 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. Results: There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9%), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. Conclusions: COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity. With the prospect of prolonged restriction of movement, DMHS such as MindSpot could play an important role in both providing clinical services and monitoring the mental health of the population.",0
1505,"BACKGROUD: Effective communication of accurate information through social media constitutes an important component of public health interventions in modern time, when traditional public health approaches such as contact tracing, quarantine and isolation are among the few options for the containing the disease spread in the population. The success of control of COVID-19 outbreak started from Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province of China relies heavily on the resilience of residents to follow public health interventions which induce substantial interruption of social-economic activities, and evidence shows that opinion leaders have been playing significant roles in the propagation of epidemic information and public health policy and implementations. METHODS: We design a mathematical model to quantify the roles of information superspreaders in single specific information which outbreaks rapidly and usually has a short duration period, and to examine the information propagation dynamics in the Chinese Sina-microblog. Our opinion-leader susceptible-forwarding-immune (OL-SFI) model is formulated to track the temporal evolution of forwarding quantities generated by opinion leaders and normal users. RESULTS: Data fitting from the real data of COVID-19 obtained from Chinese Sina-microblog can identify the different contact rates and forwarding probabilities (and hence calculate the basic information forwarding reproduction number of superspreaders), and can be used to evaluate the roles of opinion leaders in different stages of the information propagation and the outbreak unfolding. CONCLUSIONS: The parameterized model can be used to nearcast the information propagation trend, and the model-based sensitivity analysis can help to explore important factors for the roles of opinion leaders.",0
1506,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is thought to be transmitted mainly by person-to-person contact (1). Implementation of nationwide public health orders to limit person-to-person interaction and of guidance on personal protective practices can slow transmission (2,3). Such strategies can include stay-at-home orders, business closures, prohibitions against mass gatherings, use of cloth face coverings, and maintenance of a physical distance between persons (2,3). To assess and understand public attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs related to this guidance and COVID-19, representative panel surveys were conducted among adults aged ≥18 years in New York City (NYC) and Los Angeles, and broadly across the United States during May 5-12, 2020. Most respondents in the three cohorts supported stay-at-home orders and nonessential business closures* (United States, 79.5%; New York City, 86.7%; and Los Angeles, 81.5%), reported always or often wearing cloth face coverings in public areas (United States, 74.1%, New York City, 89.6%; and Los Angeles 89.8%), and believed that their state's restrictions were the right balance or not restrictive enough (United States, 84.3%; New York City, 89.7%; and Los Angeles, 79.7%).

Patients with COVID-19 are not allowed to receive visitors and many hospitals and nursing homes have completely banned visitors. Many support services have been reduced or stopped completely. Necessary treatment interventions for other patients with critical and life-limiting diseases have been delayed or suspended in order to free resources for the expected COVID-19 patients; however, these people need to feel social connectedness with their relatives. Palliative care patients should be exempted from any ban on visitors. Families should be able to visit dying patients even on intensive care units or isolation wards, using adequate protective equipment. Alternative options, such as video telephone calls or via social media should be explored for patients in isolation. Families should also be enabled to say goodbye to the deceased with adequate protective equipment or should be offered alternative real or virtual options for remembrance and commemoration. Health care professionals coping with the exceptional stress should be continuously supported. This requires clear communication and leadership structures, communication training, psychosocial support, but most of all optimal framework conditions for the clinical work.",0
1509,"COVID-19 has drastically altered our lives in an unprecedented manner, shuttering industries, and leaving most of the country in isolation as we adapt to the evolving crisis.

During these turbulent times, it is crucial to understand that while patient and care-providers safety is paramount, canceling or postponing essential surgical care is not without consequences, and may be irreversibly detrimental to a patient's health and quality of life in some cases. The optimal solution of how to effectively balance the resumption of standard surgical care while doing everything possible to limit the spread of COVID-19 is undetermined, and could include strategies such as social distancing, screening forms and tests including temperature screening, segregation of inpatient and outpatient teams, proper use of protective gear, and the use of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) to provide elective, yet ultimately essential, surgical care while conserving resources and protecting the health of patients and health-care providers.

1512,"BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as a public health emergency. All nations are seriously challenged as the virus spreads rapidly across the globe with no regard for borders. The primary management of IBD involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with most patients requiring immune-based therapies. However, these therapies may weaken the immune system and potentially place IBD patients at increased risk of infections and infectious complications including those from COVID-19. AIM: To summarise the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, review unique concerns regarding IBD management and infection risk during the pandemic and assess COVID-19 management options and drug interactions in the IBD population. METHODS: A literature review on IBD, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 was undertaken and relevant literature was summarised and critically examined. RESULTS: IBD patients do not appear to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is no evidence of an association between IBD therapies and increased risk of COVID-19. IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high-dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Patients should exercise social distancing, optimise co-morbidities and be up to date with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. If a patient develops COVID-19, immune suppressing medications should be withheld until infection resolution and if trial medications for COVID-19 are being considered, potential drug interactions should be checked. CONCLUSIONS: IBD patient management presents a challenge in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The primary focus should remain on keeping bowel inflammation controlled and encouraging medication adherence.",0

1517,"We sought to evaluate contact rate reduction goals for household and close contacts and to provide preventive recommendations during the coronavirus pandemic. We applied an agent-based model to simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 within household or close contacts through a social network of 150 nodes. there is no great difference in total infected people within modifications in number of links per node for networks with average number of links per node greater than three. For six nodes, total infected people are 149.85; for five nodes, 148.97; and for four nodes, 141.57. On the other hand, for three nodes, total infected are 82.39, for two nodes, 13.95; and for one node, 2.96.

There are multiple reports of prolonged viral shedding in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 but the presence of viral RNA on a test does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. The duration of quarantine required after clinical recovery to definitively prevent transmission is therefore uncertain. In addition, asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission may occur, and infectivity may be highest early after onset of symptoms, meaning that contact tracing, isolation of exposed individuals and social distancing are essential public health measures to prevent further spread.

1520,"1. Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late December, 2019. Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 1,5 million people and caused the death of more than a hundred thousand people across the globe as of writing. Recently, Mao et al. [1] investigated the penetration potential of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system in 214 patients. They reported that 36.4% of the patients had some neurologic findings which are ranged from nonspecific manifestations, e.g., dizziness, headache, and seizure, to specific manifestations, e.g., loss of sense of smell or taste, and stroke. Whether these common symptoms in their patients are related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known. However, it is important to mention here that dramatic neurologic symptoms, i.e., depressed level of consciousness, seizure, and stroke, are common in the patients at the late stage of the disease, accounting for increased mortality rate in severely affected patients. Nevertheless, to objectively delve into the direct relation between the neurologic symptoms and COVID-19, medical comorbidities of patients should also be considered [2]. Further studies are needed because we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, and neurologists may be confronted with new-onset neurologic symptoms owing to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates via human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE-2) that was also utilized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) [3]. Glial cells and neurons have been reported to express ACE-2 receptors, which make them a potential target of COVID-19. It was indicated that SARS CoV causes neuronal death by invading the brain via olfactory epithelium [4]. The electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription- PCR findings have corroborated the presence of SARS-CoV in the brain tissue [4] and cerebrospinal fluid [5]. Together, it can be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain by penetrating the brain via the cribriform plate, which can account for the early findings of the COVID-19 like altered sense of smell or hyposmia. Because SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory symptoms in people aged 60 years and older, it has important implications for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [6]. Therefore, in the countries that have taken action to the virus, clinic studies of AD have been stopped to protect the patients. However, rigorous quarantine of elders has aborted clinic trials and experimental studies conducted with transgenic animals. Transgenic models are quite expensive; the loss of these animals has costly consequences. There is no doubt that this storm will stop, but its catastrophic effects on dementia research will continue for a time. Thus, dementia researchers and pharmaceutical companies should determine an emergency action plan to exit the chaos of this pandemic. Here, we listed some challenges in dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak and table some suggestions. All countries try to control SARS-CoV-2 by social distancing. Therefore, neurology clinics were closed, and routine examination of Alzheimer's patients was stopped. However, the lockdown of patients with AD caused clinical studies to stop. which has severely affected dementia research. Additionally, the arrest of experimental studies due to the closing of universities in two hundred countries also deprives experimental achievements. The closing of universities may lead to data loss, death of expensive transgenic animals, international researchers to be faced with visa problems, and be lost the laboratory staff whose contract has expired [7]. It is impossible that forecasting when this COVID-19 pandemic will end is impossible and thus, it is essential that a solution be developed to continue dementia studies on Alzheimer's patients. Remote monitoring of the patients with the use of technology is in the lead of possible solutions. Clinicians can continue to follow their patients by telemedicine [8], but extended lockdown of patients may cause depression in both patients and their caregivers [9]. It is also known that movement restriction exacerbates AD symptoms [10]. The monitorization of the patient in this condition with telemedicine would not provide objective data. In addition, when patients living in rural areas are considered, it will not be a surprise that reaching equally all patients is impossible. Therefore, a collective action plan protecting dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak should be prepared by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies, researchers, clinicians, and patients. Data loss is in the lead of expected problems during the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, the planned ending dates of phase 2/3 trials of gantenerumab (Roche) and solanezumab (Lilly) were missed [11]. It is highly essential that patients be monitored from their homes with telemedicine to protect them. Nonetheless, it is not sufficient for the continuation of clinical trials and experimental studies. We suggest that patients of phase trails should be isolated in fully-equipped nursing homes managed by qualified personnel. In this way, the patients can be more effectively protected from SARS-CoV-2 and the depression caused by the lockdown.Young family members going out for basic needs could infect older family members. Also, patients with AD pay less attention to hand hygiene, which makes them more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, cats have recently been shown to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Patients with AD may not follow directions of neurologists on telemedicine and thus, the interaction of Alzheimer's patients with pets can cause a dangerous scenario. Consequently, the lockdown of patients with dementia in their homes might not be an appropriate exit strategy for the future of dementia research. On the other hand, it is important to mention here that the nursing home capacity of the United States may not be sufficient for 5,8 million Alzheimer's patients aged 65 years and older [13]. Thus, we highlight that only the patients involved in the clinic trails should be followed in the nursing homes. The other patients can be monitored with telemedicine from their homes. The data will hardly be lost in patients isolated in nursing homes. In this strategy, secondary risk factors affecting the clinic trails like depression are also removed. The motivations of clinicians and researchers is as important as the patients in the catastrophic atmosphere of the outbreak. Governments, media, and funders can support the motivations of clinicians and researchers. For example, research funders and pharmaceutical companies can extend project deadlines and provide an additional promotion to the researchers who have completed their clinic trails. Consequently, a global action plan should be prepared to block SARS-CoV-2 penetration to dementia research. At first glance, it may be thought that the most appropriate strategy for patients with dementia is social isolation in their homes during the outbreak as in healthy young people and elders. However, we suggest that isolating patients with dementia in fully-equipped nursing homes can be a more appropriate exit strategy for the protection of dementia patients and research.",0
1521,"The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached over five million confirmed cases worldwide, and numbers are still growing at a fast rate. Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries/regions. In the early stages of a new pathogen outbreak, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the infection transmission, in order to follow contagion over time and project the epidemiological situation in the near future. While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stems from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown. Here, we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency positively correlates with particulate air pollutants, and specifically with particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), while ozone gas is oppositely related with the number of infected individuals. We propose that atmospheric air pollutants could thus serve as surrogate markers to complement the infection outbreak anticipation.",0
1523,"This is a personal view from London as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread here and the situation changes from day to day. As such it can only be a snapshot caught in time; it is not a diary of events. The Coronavirus Act 2020 gives Government enormous powers and was passed by Parliament in one day of debate immediately before it closed early for the Easter break. In March, the government imposed a ""lockdown: the closure of all"" but ""essential"" businesses and people other than essential workers must work from home but are allowed out for exercise and food shopping but must maintain 2 m apart, the ""social distancing rule"". The aim is to suppress the spread of the virus, reduce the death toll and ""protect the National Health Service (NHS)"" which needed time to empty wards and expand its intensive care unit (ICU) capability to deal with an expected influx of thousands of very sick patients. I discuss whether this strategy is working, how and why it has rapidly been altered to respond to criticism. Why was the Government so slow to seek the help of private laboratories to assist with testing? Why was the personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance altered only after criticism? I look at the impact of the lockdown on the UK economy, the changes to practice of medicine and speeding of scientific research. Cooperating with the lockdown has its price; is it harming the health and mental health of children, people living in households with potentially abusive partners or parents and those who are disabled or financially desperate? Is the cure worse than the disease? The Economy is being devastated by the lockdown and each day of lockdown it is worse. Is litigation being seeded even now by the pandemic? Notwithstanding unprecedented Government financial help many businesses are on the edge of collapse, people will lose their jobs and pensioners income. The winners include pharmacies, supermarkets, online food retailers, Amazon, online apps, providers of video games, services, streaming and scientific research laboratories, manufacturers of testing kits, ventilators, hand sanitisers, coffins, undertakers, etc. The British public is cooperating with lockdown but are we less productive at home? Parents with babies and children often child minders, school, grandparents or paid help which is not now available. Will current reliance on video-conferencing and video calls permanently change the way we work and will we need smaller city offices? Will we travel less? Will medical and legal practice and civil and criminal trials be generally carried out remotely? Will social distancing with self-isolation and job losses and business failures fuel depression? Is Covid-19 comparable to past epidemics like the Plague and Spanish flu?",0
1525,"INTRODUCTION: Demonstrating the results of Social Distancing Strategies (SDS) became a relevant factor to obtain support by the population in São Paulo State and in Brazil. The delay in the processing of PCR tests and the small number of tests available limits the ability of sanitary authorities to make meaningful data available as to the number of cases or the number of deaths due to COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: We use a time series analysis of deaths due to COVID-19 referenced to the date of deaths (as opposed to the date in which the test results were obtained). RESULTS: We demonstrate that the SDS adopted in São Paulo City and State clearly brought meaningful results to delay the growth of COVID-19 cases. We also show that by using this type of time series it is possible to identify different trends for regions, allowing for targeted approaches. Additionally, by using a time series which is death-oriented makes it possible to identify, for São Paulo City, the effects of the SDS with the Social Isolation Index (SII) adopted in the state and to make a gross estimate for the SII, which prevents the growth of the disease. CONCLUSION: The use of a time series of deaths due to COVID-19 referenced to the date of the event allows a better understanding of the effects of the SDS on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic in São Paulo State, Brazil.",0
1526,"OBJECTIVE: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an interactive tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19. RESULTS: We organized data sharing of published social contact surveys via online repositories and formatting guidelines. We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R[Formula: see text]. We incorporated location-specific physical distancing measures (e.g. school closure or at work) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that physical distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s).",0
1528,"The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly, inducing a progressive growth in infected patients number. Social isolation (lockdown) has been assessed to prevent and control virus diffusion, leading to a worldwide financial and political crisis. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swab takes place by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). However, molecular tests can give some false-negative results. In this context, serological assays can be useful to detect IgG/IgM antibodies, to assess the degree of immunization, to trace the contacts, and to support the decision to re-admit people at work. A lot of serological diagnostic kits have been proposed on the market but validation studies have not been published for many of them. The aim of our work was to compare and to evaluate different assays analytical performances (two different immunochromatographic cards, an immunofluorescence chromatographic card, and a chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay) on 43 positive samples with RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 negative control subjects. Our data display excellent IgG/IgM specificities for all the immunocromatographic card tests (100% IgG and 100% IgM) and for the chemiluminescence-automated assay (100% IgG and 94% IgM); IgG/IgM sensitivities are moderately lower for all methods, probably due to the assay viral antigen's nature and/or to the detection time of nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, with respect to symptoms onset. Given that sensitivities (around 94% and 84% for IgG and IgM, respectively) implicate false-negative cases and given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments, the only currently available procedure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission is to identify and isolate persons who are contagious. For this reason, we would like to submit a flowchart in which serological tests, integrated with nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, are included to help social and work activities implementation after the pandemic acute phase and to overcome lockdown.",0
1529,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for an epidemic disease called COVID-19, which was initially evidenced in Wuhan, China, and spread very rapidly in China and around the world. In France, the first isolated case seems now to be reported in December 2019, stage 3 of the COVID-19 epidemic was triggered on March 14th, the start of the planned containment exit from May 11th. Healthcare services have faced a large influx of patients who may be beyond their capacity to receive and care, particularly in the Large-East and Ile-de-France regions. Some patients show an evolution of the disease never observed before with other coronaviruses and develop in a few days a very important inflammatory reaction, which can lead to death of patients. A working group of the French Society of Clinical Biology (SFBC) was set up with the objective of providing updated information on the current status of the biological prescriptions (focusing on biochemistry ones) and their evolution during the epidemic, and of analyzing the biological parameters associated with comorbidities and patient evolution in order to link biological results with medical events. The expanded working group covers all sectors of medical biology in France and extends to the French-speaking world: hospital sectors (CHU and CH, Army Training Hospitals) and the private sector opening a field of view on the biological situation in establishments for dependent elderly, social establishments and clinical medical institutions. The purpose of this article is the presentation of this working group and its immediate and future actions.",0

1532,"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged researchers and policy makers to identify public safety measures forpreventing the collapse of healthcare systems and reducingdeaths. This narrative review summarizes the available evidence on the impact of social distancing measures on the epidemic and discusses the implementation of these measures in Brazil. Articles on the effect of social distancing on COVID-19 were selected from the PubMed, medRXiv and bioRvix databases. Federal and state legislation was analyzed to summarize the strategies implemented in Brazil. Social distancing measures adopted by the population appear effective, particularly when implemented in conjunction with the isolation of cases and quarantining of contacts. Therefore, social distancing measures, and social protection policies to guarantee the sustainability of these measures, should be implemented. To control COVID-19 in Brazil, it is also crucial that epidemiological monitoring is strengthened at all three levels of the Brazilian National Health System (SUS). This includes evaluating and usingsupplementary indicators to monitor the progression of the pandemic and the effect of the control measures, increasing testing capacity, and making disaggregated notificationsand testing resultstransparentand broadly available.",0
1533,"Testing for the presence of coronavirus is an essential diagnostic tool for monitoring and managing the current COVID-19 pandemic. The only reliable test in current use for testing acute infection targets the genome of SARS-CoV-2, and the most widely used method is quantitative fluorescence-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Despite its ubiquity, there is a significant amount of uncertainty about how this test works, potential throughput and reliability. This has resulted in widespread misrepresentation of the problems faced using this test during the current COVID-19 epidemic. This primer provides simple, straightforward and impartial information about RT-qPCR.",0
1534,"BACKGROUND From the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began to spread in central China. Social capital is a measure of social trust, belonging, and participation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic in central China. MATERIAL AND METHODS Individuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third day of isolation. Individual social capital was assessed using the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire. Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson's correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS Low levels of social capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but increased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased quality of sleep. Anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality, and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social capital on sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS During a period of individual self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic in central China, increased social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress.",0
1535,"Social distancing and isolation have been widely introduced to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse social, psychological and economic consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown demand the development of more moderate contact-reduction policies. Adopting a social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three distancing strategies designed to keep the curve flat and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are: limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts akin to forming social bubbles; seeking similarity across contacts; and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate stochastic infection curves incorporating core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models and statistical relational event models. We demonstrate that a strategic social network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower. We provide scientific evidence for effective social distancing that can be applied in public health messaging and that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.",0
1536,"The World Health Organization has recognized the pandemic nature of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak. A large proportion of positive patients require hospitalization, while 5-6% of them may need more aggressive therapies in intensive care. Most governments have recommended social separation and severe measures of prevention of further spreading of the epidemic. Because hemodialysis (HD) patients need to access hospital and dialysis center facilities 3 times a week, this category of patients requires special attention. In this editorial, we tried to summarize the experience of our centers that hopefully may contribute to help other centers and colleagues that are facing the coming wave of the epidemic. Special algorithms for COVID-19 spreading in the dialysis population, recommendations for isolation and preventive measures in positive HD patients, and finally directions to manage logistics and personnel are reported. These recommendations should be considered neither universal nor absolute. Instead, they require local adjustments based on geographic location, cultural and social environments, and level of available resources.",0

1544,"To contain the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, health and government authorities have imposed sweeping self-quarantine orders for communities worldwide. Health officials assume that the public will have high rates of compliance. However, studies suggest that a major obstacle to compliance for household quarantine is concern about loss of income. A cross-sectional study of the adult population of Israel was conducted in the last week of February 2020 to assess public attitudes toward the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, public compliance rates with self-quarantine were assessed, depending on whether lost wages would be compensated for. When compensation was assumed, the compliance rate was 94 percent. When compensation was removed, the compliance rate dropped to less than 57 percent. This study demonstrated that providing people with assurances about their livelihoods during self-quarantine is an important component of compliance with public health regulations.",0

1547,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing on mental health, and potential correlates, among a sample of the UK population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Data collected on predictors included sex, age, marital status, employment, annual income, region, current smoking, current alcohol consumption, physical multimorbidity, any physical symptoms experienced during self-isolation/social distancing, and the number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between potential predictors and poor mental health was studied using a multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: 932 participants were included. Factors associated with poor mental health were sex (reference: male; female: OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.34-2.68), age (18-24 years: reference;45-54 years: OR=0.27, 95%CI=0.14-0.53; 55-64 years: OR=0.24, 95%CI=0.12-0.47; 65-74years: OR=0.10, 95% CI=0.05-0.22; and ≥75years: OR=0.08,95% CI=0.03-0.24),annual income (<£15,000: reference; £25,000-<£40,000: OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.31-0.93; £40,000-<£60,000: OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.22-0.69; and ≥£60,000: OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.21-0.67), current smoking (yes: OR=2.59, 95%CI=1.62-4.20), and physical multimorbidity (OR=2.35, 95%CI=1.61-3.46).

1548,"The management of lockdown presents a perfect storm for mental distress for older people by enforcing isolation and heightening perceptions of risk of death and illness. While gradual release from lockdown will maintain protection of those most at risk from covid-19, older people will experience social isolation for the longest period as the over 75s carry the highest mortality risk (WHO, 2020). Isolation is strongly linked to depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline, and reduces resilience factors such as self-worth, sense of purpose and feeling valued (Novotney, 2019). However, in addition to sustained isolation, governmental management of lockdown presents other challenges for older people.",0
1549,"The COVID-19 pandemic is one the biggest challenges the global community has faced this century. The threat of the virus coupled with the impacts of the social and economic shut-down measures required to slow its spread, appear to be impacting on people's mental health and wellbeing. Over the weeks, months and years ahead it is likely that many countries will experience a 'wave' of COVID-19 related mental disorders as a result of an increase in risk factors linked to the pandemic such as social isolation; unemployment; housing and income stress; intimate partner violence; work-related trauma; and grief and loss. The 'two-pronged' approach used to deal with COVID-19, provides an excellent blueprint for managing its mental health impacts as well. Nations must focus on preventing the occurrence of new-onset cases of mental disorders as well as strengthening their mental healthcare response to support people who become mentally unwell. A focus on primary prevention is particularly important to 'flatten the curve' and avoid a surge in incidence of mental disorders stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based interventions designed to prevent common disorders are already available and should be scaled-up.

1551,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has produced substantial health challenges from the perspective of both its direct health complications and the disruption to delivery of standard care for individuals with a range of acute and chronic health issues. In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients. CHALLENGES: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord. The consequences of these complications will be further magnified, when considering their potential effect on cardiovascular disease and its management.

1552,"Objectives: Transmission of infectious diseases is often prevented by quarantine and isolation of the populations at risk. These approaches restrict the mobility, social interactions, and daily activities of the affected individuals. In recent novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, quarantine and isolation are being adopted in many contexts, which necessitates an evaluation of global evidence on how such measures impact the mental health outcomes among populations. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the available evidence on mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for preventing infectious diseases. Methods: We searched nine major databases and additional sources and included articles if they were systematically conducted reviews, published as peer-reviewed journal articles, and reported mental health outcomes of quarantine or isolation in any population. Results: Among 1364 citations, only eight reviews met our criteria. Most of the primary studies in those reviews were conducted in high-income nations and in hospital settings. These articles reported a high burden of mental health problems among patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare providers who experienced quarantine or isolation. Prevalent mental health problems among the affected individuals include depression, anxiety, mood disorders, psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, fear, stigmatization, low self-esteem, lack of self-control, and other adverse mental health outcomes. Conclusion: : This umbrella review found severe mental health problems among individuals and populations who have undergone quarantine and isolation in different contexts. This evidence necessitates multipronged interventions including policy measures for strengthening mental health services globally and promoting psychosocial wellbeing among high-risk populations.",0

METHODS: Search of the MEDLINE database for relevant studies related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks. RESULTS: Across 13 identified studies, quarantine measures were consistently associated with negative psychosocial outcomes, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, stress, posttraumatic stress, social isolation, loneliness and stigmatization. Determinants comprised duration of quarantine measures and income losses. Health care workers constituted a particularly vulnerable group. CONCLUSION: Quarantine measures during serious coronavirus outbreaks have extensive negative consequences for mental health. Prevention and intervention approaches to attenuate the psychosocial impact should be an integral component of crisis response during pandemic conditions.",0

These measures have the potential to threaten the mental health of children and adolescents significantly. Even though the current crisis can bring with it opportunities for personal growth and family cohesion, disadvantages may outweigh these benefits. Anxiety, lack of peer contact and reduced opportunities for stress regulation are main concerns. Another main threat is an increased risk for parental mental illness, domestic violence and child maltreatment. Especially for children and adolescents with special needs or disadvantages, such as disabilities, trauma experiences, already existing mental health problems, migrant background and low socioeconomic status, this may be a particularly challenging time. To maintain regular and emergency child and adolescent psychiatric treatment during the pandemic is a major challenge but is necessary for limiting long-term consequences for the mental health of children and adolescents. Urgent research questions comprise understanding the mental health effects of social distancing and economic pressure, identifying risk and resilience factors, and preventing long-term consequences, including-but not restricted to-child maltreatment. The efficacy of telepsychiatry is another highly relevant issue is to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth and perfect its applications to child and adolescent psychiatry. Conclusion: There are numerous mental health threats associated with the current pandemic and subsequent restrictions. Child and adolescent psychiatrists must ensure continuity of care during all phases of the pandemic. COVID-19-associated mental health risks will disproportionately hit children and adolescents who are already disadvantaged and marginalized. Research is needed to assess the implications of policies enacted to contain the pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents, and to estimate the risk/benefit ratio of measures such as home schooling, in order to be better prepared for future developments.",0
1566,"Objective: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak that began in China has turned into a pandemic that threatens global health, thereby prompting the concentration of studies and clinical routines on treating and preventing the disease. However, research on the psychological effects of the pandemic on the general population, particularly pregnant women, is lacking. Accordingly, the present study investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression and anxiety in pregnant women.Study design: An anonymous survey for assessing depression and anxiety in pregnant women was designed, after which a link to the online questionnaire was sent to the participants, who were being treated in a private medical center. One of the researchers followed up with the respondents, among whom 260 returned their questionnaires.Results: Among the respondents, 35.4% (n = 92, case group) obtained scores higher than 13 on the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). The comparison of the groups by years of education indicated statistically significant effects of COVID-19 on psychology, social isolation, and mean scores in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). These effects were more severe in the case group than in the control group (psychology: 8.369 ± 2.003, social isolation: 8.000 ± 2.507, mean BDI and BAI scores: 20.565 ± 6.605 and 22.087 ± 8.689, respectively). A regression analysis revealed that the BDI scores and the disease's psychological effects, as well as the BAI scores and the illness's social isolation effects, exerted a statistically significant influence on the EPDS scores of the participants.Conclusion: This study illustrated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the depression and anxiety levels of pregnant women. Our results point to an urgent need to provide psychosocial support to this population during the crisis. Otherwise, adverse events may occur during pregnancy and thus affect both mother and fetus.",0
1567,"This paper presents the results of an opinion poll conducted in Brazil on the perception of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was prepared on Google Forms, disseminated through social networks, with questions about the socioeconomic profile and factors associated with isolation. A non-probabilistic sample was obtained with 16,440 respondents. Data were analyzed using the Stata 13 software. Social interaction was the most affected aspect among people with higher education and income (45.8%), and financial problems caused a more significant impact (35%) among people with low income and education. Those who practice some physical activity showed lower levels of stress 13%, as well as greater normality in sleep 50.3%. People who reported living in worse habitability conditions reported willingness to remain isolated for less time, 73.9%. Among non-isolated people (10.7% of the total sample), 75.8% believe that social isolation will reduce the number of victims of COVID-19. We conclude, based on this sample, that the perception about social isolation as a pandemic mitigation action varies by income, education, age, and gender. However, most believe that it is the most appropriate control measure and are willing to wait as long as necessary to contribute to the fight against COVID-19.",0
1568,"Mental disorders (MD) are commonly comorbid with cardiovascular, metabolic, and some infectious diseases. Since the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is affecting the most multimorbid individuals, we might expect that the epidemic will be particularly problematic for people with MD. Understanding the burden of an outbreak on mental health is fundamental to effective action towards containing the spread of the disease, as psychopathology might reduce endurance during the lockdown. This can potentially reduce adhesion to ongoing treatment resulting in avoidable recurrence of a disorder. Additionally, there is the stress caused by the eminent risk of infection or economic uncertainty, especially in low-middle income settings. This is an overview on the expected influence of the COVID-19 on mental health from a research group that has not long ago been involved in the Zika epidemic. It aims to discuss the effects of the pandemic on a Low and Middle-Income country (LMIC), Brazil.",0
1569,"As the systems that people depend on are increasingly strained by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, public health impacts are manifesting in different ways beyond morbidity and mortality for elderly populations. Loneliness is already a chief public health concern that is being made worse by COVID-19. Agencies should recognize the prevalence of loneliness among elderly populations and the impacts that their interventions have on loneliness. This letter describes several ways that loneliness can be addressed to build resilience for elderly populations as part of the public health response to COVID-19.",0
1570,"Insomnia is a major health issue associated with great psychological burden. Research of insomnia during a pandemic crisis is limited. The aim of the present study was to explore sleep difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Greek population. The three-day online survey included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, contact with COVID-19 and COVID-19-related negative attitudes, as well as the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Intolerance to Uncertainty scale (IUS), the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness scale (JGLS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) Depression Scale. Altogether, 2,427 individuals participated in the study (with 2,363 of them providing all basic demographic data). Sleep problems were detected in 37.6% of the participants. Women and people in urban areas were more vulnerable to sleep problems, while younger age showed a non-significant trend. Those uncertain about having themselves, or someone close to them contracted the virus, also demonstrated elevated insomnia scores. Lastly, according to the regression analysis, higher levels of intolerance to uncertainty, COVID-19-related worry, loneliness, as well as more severe depressive symptoms, were all predictive of insomnia. Results may be used for the development of therapeutic strategies and implementation of social policies to support people with sleep difficulties.",0
1574,"The COVID-19 pandemic with its subsequent mental health consequences has challenged the word view of most people. A genome typically of 26,000-32,000 bases long RNA has shut down the wheel of man made progress. The social isolation after the lock-down has not only led to economic difficulties but also adverse psychological reactions. The most common reaction is stress, anxiety and depression when faced with life-threatening circumstances. People have to deal with the imminent issue of death which is anxiety provoking in itself. This calls for dealing with the immediate mental health consequences with the aide of technological advancements as discussed in this write-up. A new inter-personal ethics need to emerge which is scientifically correct and in-line with age old values.",0
1575,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been particularly challenging for nursing home staff and residents. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regulation waivers are burdening staff and affecting how care is delivered. Residents are experiencing social isolation, which can result in physical and behavioral health issues, particularly for persons with dementia. These challenges can be addressed in part through technology adaptations. Full integration of electronic health record systems can improve workflow and care quality. Telehealth can improve access to outside providers, provide remote monitoring, and improve social connectedness. Electronic and audiovisual programs can be used for end-of-life planning and information sharing between nursing home staff and families. Online learning systems and other online resources provide flexible options for staff education and training. Investing in and adapting technology can help mitigate workforce stress and improve the quality of nursing home care during and after the COVID-19 crisis.",0
1576,"The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.",0
1577,"As the spread of COVID-19 has led to global efforts to social distance, concerns about the negative psychological effects of social isolation and loneliness have grown. The purpose of this commentary is to draw attention to 2 populations across the life span at risk for the psychological sequelae of social isolation and loneliness: young adults and old-old adults. We present data from three population-based longitudinal studies from two nations (United States and Sweden) to support this view. We then provide recommendations for the prevention of loneliness during social distancing as well as after social distancing measures are eased through implementation of programs that match young adults with older adults to foster intergenerational connection and group-based psychotherapy.

1578,"This column anticipates challenges likely to be faced by psychotherapists and their patients after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic subsides. It looks beyond the current impact of loneliness, isolation, thwarted belongingness, and loss toward the longer term impact of moral injury and blocked opportunities for mourning.",0
1579,"OBJECTIVE: Disease containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation. We aimed to establish what is known about how loneliness and disease containment measures impact on the mental health in children and adolescents. METHOD: For this rapid review, we searched MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, and Web of Science for articles published between 01/01/1946 and 03/29/2020. 20% of articles were double screened using pre-defined criteria and 20% of data was double extracted for quality assurance. RESULTS: 83 articles (80 studies) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 63 studies reported on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of previously healthy children and adolescents (n=51,576; mean age 15.3) 61 studies were observational; 18 were longitudinal and 43 cross sectional studies assessing self-reported loneliness in healthy children and adolescents. One of these studies was a retrospective investigation after a pandemic. Two studies evaluated interventions. Studies had a high risk of bias although longitudinal studies were of better methodological quality. Social isolation and loneliness increased the risk of depression, and possibly anxiety at the time loneliness was measured and between 0.25 to 9 years later. Duration of loneliness was more strongly correlated with mental health symptoms than intensity of loneliness. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents are probably more likely to experience high rates of depression and probably anxiety during and after enforced isolation ends. This may increase as enforced isolation continues. Clinical services should offer preventative support and early intervention where possible and be prepared for an increase in mental health problems.",0
1580,"Measures to prevent and contain the COVID-19 health crisis include population confinement, with the consequent isolation and interruption of their usual activities. The aim of the study is to analyse psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this, a cross-sectional observational study with a sample of 4180 people over the age of 18 during quarantine was developed. Variables considered were sociodemographic variables, physical symptoms, health conditions, COVID-19 contact history and psychological adjustment. The data were collected through a self-developed questionnaire and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Bivariate analyses were performed, including Chi-Squared test and Student's T-test. Predictive ability was calculated through logistic regression. Results obtained showed a high level of psychological distress (72.0%), with a higher percentage in women and people of lower middle age. Statistically significant differences were found in the variable working situation (χ² = 63.139, p≤ 0.001, V = 0.123) and living with children under the age of 16 (χ² = 7.393, p = 0.007, V = 0.042). The predictive variables with the highest weight were sex (OR = 1.952, 95% IC = (1.667, 2.286)), presence of symptoms (OR = 1.130, 95% CI = (1.074, 1.190)), and having had close contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 (OR = 1.241, 95% CI = (1.026, 1.500)). These results could enrich prevention interventions in public health and, in particular, in mental health in similar pandemic situations.",0
1581,"The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread all over the world leading to declaration of a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020. Most countries around the world have been on lockdown in an effort to halt the spread of virus. People around the world have been pushed into uncharted waters of uncertainty, fear, anxiety, stress and depression due to economic crash down, job losses and fear for their own health and that of their loved ones. There is a known association between anxiety/stress and sleep disturbances and vice versa. The most vulnerable population in this isolation like condition, in this lockdown, are the chief earning member of the family, women, young ones, and people with psychiatric illness.",0
1582,"Emerging data indicate a substantial decrease in global physical activity levels during the period of social isolation adopted worldwide to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Confinement-induced decreases in physical activity levels and increases in sedentary behavior may provoke a rapid deterioration of cardiovascular health and premature deaths among populations with increased cardiovascular risk. Even short-term (1-4 wk) inactivity has been linked with detrimental effects in cardiovascular function and structure and increased cardiovascular risk factors. In this unprecedented and critical scenario, home-based physical activity programs arise as a clinically relevant intervention to promote health benefits to cardiac patients. Many studies have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of different models of home-based exercise programs in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and major cardiovascular events among different populations. This body of knowledge can inform evidence-based policies to be urgently implemented to counteract the impact of increased physical inactivity and sedentary behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak, thereby alleviating the global burden of cardiovascular disease.",0
1583,"Older age and medical comorbidity are factors associated with more severe illness and risk of death due to COVID-19 infection. Social distancing is an important public health strategy for controlling the spread of the virus and minimizing its impact on the older adult population. It comes at a cost, however. Loneliness is associated with myriad adverse health outcomes, one of which is impaired immune functioning, which adds even greater risk for corona virus infection, complications and death. Older adults, therefore, are at compound risk, making effective management of loneliness and social isolation in our older patients a high priority target for preventive intervention. In this paper, we describe a cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness, including evidence-informed strategies clinicians can use to help patients develop a 'Connections Plan' to stay connected and promote their social, mental, and physical health during 'social distancing' restrictions. This set of strategies can be provided during brief (30 minute) telephone sessions and is analogous to creating a 'Safety Plan' for suicide risk. The approach is illustrated with three case examples.",0
1584,"Adolescence (the stage between 10 and 24 years) is a period of life characterised by heightened sensitivity to social stimuli and the increased need for peer interaction. The physical distancing measures mandated globally to contain the spread of COVID-19 are radically reducing adolescents' opportunities to engage in face-to-face social contact outside their household. In this interdisciplinary Viewpoint, we describe literature from a variety of domains that highlight how social deprivation in adolescence might have far-reaching consequences. Human studies have shown the importance of peer acceptance and peer influence in adolescence. Animal research has shown that social deprivation and isolation have unique effects on brain and behaviour in adolescence compared with other stages of life. However, the decrease in adolescent face-to-face contact might be less detrimental due to widespread access to digital forms of social interaction through technologies such as social media. The findings reviewed highlight how physical distancing might have a disproportionate effect on an age group for whom peer interaction is a vital aspect of development.",0
1586,"The coronavirus disease 2019 represents an unprecedented threat to human health worldwide. In the absence of a specific available cure for this disease, countries are adopting mitigation strategies that largely depend on physical distancing, with a dramatic restriction of social contacts. Whereas the psychological burden related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is starting to be well characterized by population-based surveys, we would like to capitalize from infant research evidence about the potentials of psychological reparation for human trauma and disconnection. Reparation can be defined as the human ability to coregulate emotions and to resolve interactive mismatches and separations by reciprocally engaging in attuned interactive exchanges capable of expanding our capacities for resilience. Alongside economical and medical health solutions, investing in psychological, emotional, and affective reparatory acts is warranted to be a key component of the recovery strategies worldwide.

1587,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused enormous psychological impact worldwide. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 Nov 2019 to 25 May 2020. We conducted literature research using Embase, PubMed, Google scholar and WHO COVID-19 databases. Among the initial search of 9207 studies, 62 studies with 162,639 participants from 17 countries were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% confidence interval: 28%-38%) and 28% (23%-32%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]), and it was similar between healthcare workers and the general public. Studies from China, Italy, Turkey, Spain and Iran reported higher-than-pooled prevalence among healthcare workers and the general public. Common risk factors included being women, being nurses, having lower socioeconomic status, having high risks of contracting COVID-19, and social isolation. Protective factors included having sufficient medical resources, up-to-date and accurate information, and taking precautionary measures. In conclusion, psychological interventions targeting high-risk populations with heavy psychological distress are in urgent need.",0
1588,"INTRODUCTION: In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency due to the outbreak of COVID-19. In March 2020 the WHO announced that the epidemic could be characterized as a pandemic. Subsequently, the WHO acknowledged the importance of providing support to the medical teams, realizing the enormous burden and stress facing this group. The aim of the present study is to review the up-to-date professional literature dealing with the psychological impact of a pandemic outbreak on medical staff. The literature existing so-far is scarce. It does, however, provide evidence of the short- and long-term impact of such epidemics on the mental health of the medical teams. Direct exposure to affected patients, the risk of contagion, a subjectively negative perception of one's medical condition and being in isolation or quarantine, all constitute risk factors for mental symptoms such as depression, anxiety and post-trauma. A sense of control, especially regarding the means of protection and controlling infection, altruistic acceptance of the work-related risks, social support, good team-spirit in the medical unit and support from superiors are all protective factors.",0
1589,"BACKGROUND: One of the peculiar aspects of the transplant patient's life is that, in the post-surgery phase, the patient lives in an ""isolation"" condition, having to pay particular attention to the living environment and preferring a limited social life given that the immunosuppressive treatment entails immunodepression in the patient. With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID)-19, as in a post-surgery situation, social isolation is being implemented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study started on March 17, 2020, and ended on April 24, 2020. Consulting/phone interviews were made. The phone questionnaire, submitted to 71 patients, consisted of a set of 15 questions that investigated structure and psychological resistance. Eight patients have been monitored exclusively for the psychological aspect through a more articulate supporting path. RESULTS: In essence, from the overall analysis of the data derived from the study of the positioning of patients based on the stage of renal function, the bands related to the development of psychopathological aspects, and the use of positive personal resources, it emerges that patients in stage V kidney failure are in the first bracket as regards the development of psychopathological aspects (absence of these experiences) and in the third bracket as regards the good use of positive resources to deal with isolation. Therefore, it can be deduced that, although with data that can be expanded, a serious or medium-serious situation from an organic point of view in this socio-health emergency situation is well addressed by the transplanted patient. CONCLUSION: Transplant patients have faced the measure of social distancing adequately and in adherence to the treatment thanks to the phone assistance of all the medical-surgical and psychological team.",0
1591,"BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic has been identified as a possible trigger for increases in loneliness and social isolation among older people due to the restrictions on movement that many countries have put in place. Loneliness and social isolation are consistently identified as risk factors for poor mental and physical health in older people. Video calls may help older people stay connected during the current crisis by widening the participant's social circle or by increasing the frequency of contact with existing acquaintances. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this rapid review is to assess the effectiveness of video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older adults. The review also sought to address the effectiveness of video calls on reducing symptoms of depression and improving quality of life. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL from 1 January 2004 to 7 April 2020. We also searched the references of relevant systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including cluster designs) were eligible for inclusion. We excluded all other study designs. The samples in included studies needed to have a mean age of at least 65 years. We included studies that included participants whether or not they were experiencing symptoms of loneliness or social isolation at baseline. Any intervention in which a core component involved the use of the internet to facilitate video calls or video conferencing through computers, smartphones or tablets with the intention of reducing loneliness or social isolation, or both, in older adults was eligible for inclusion. We included studies in the review if they reported self-report measures of loneliness, social isolation, symptoms of depression or quality of life.  Two review authors screened 25% of abstracts; a third review author resolved conflicts. A single review author screened the remaining abstracts. The second review author screened all excluded abstracts and we resolved conflicts by consensus or by involving a third review author. We followed the same process for full-text articles. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author extracted data, which another review author checked. The primary outcomes were loneliness and social isolation and the secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and quality of life. One review author rated the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes according to the GRADE approach and another review author checked the ratings. We conducted fixed-effect meta-analyses for the primary outcome, loneliness, and the secondary outcome, symptoms of depression. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three cluster quasi-randomised trials, which together included 201 participants. The included studies compared video call interventions to usual care in nursing homes. None of these studies were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Each study measured loneliness using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Total scores range from 20 (least lonely) to 80 (most lonely). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale compared to usual care at three months (mean difference (MD) -0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.28 to 2.41; 3 studies; 201 participants), at six months (MD -0.34, 95% CI -3.41 to 2.72; 2 studies; 152 participants) and at 12 months (MD -2.40, 95% CI -7.20 to 2.40; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. None of the included studies reported social isolation as an outcome. Each study measured symptoms of depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Total scores range from 0 (better) to 30 (worse). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale compared to usual care at three months' follow-up (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.90 to 1.72; 3 studies; 201 participants) or six months' follow-up (MD -0.83, 95% CI -2.43 to 0.76; 2 studies, 152 participants). The evidence suggests that video calls may have a small effect on symptoms of depression at one-year follow-up, though this finding is imprecise (MD -2.04, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.10; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. Only one study, with 62 participants, reported quality of life. The study measured quality of life using a Taiwanese adaptation of the Short-Form 36-question health survey (SF-36), which consists of eight subscales that measure different aspects of quality of life: physical function; physical role; emotional role; social function; pain: vitality; mental health; and physical health. Each subscale is scored from 0 (poor health) to 100 (good health). The evidence is very uncertain and suggests that there may be little to no difference between people allocated to usual care and those allocated to video calls in three-month scores in physical function (MD 2.88, 95% CI -5.01 to 10.77), physical role (MD -7.66, 95% CI -24.08 to 8.76), emotional role (MD -7.18, 95% CI -16.23 to 1.87), social function (MD 2.77, 95% CI -8.87 to 14.41), pain scores (MD -3.25, 95% CI -15.11 to 8.61), vitality scores (MD -3.60, 95% CI -9.01 to 1.81), mental health (MD 9.19, 95% CI 0.36 to 18.02) and physical health (MD 5.16, 95% CI -2.48 to 12.80). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on this review there is currently very uncertain evidence on the effectiveness of video call interventions to reduce loneliness in older adults. The review did not include any studies that reported evidence of the effectiveness of video call interventions to address social isolation in older adults. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of video calls for outcomes of symptoms of depression was very uncertain. Future research in this area needs to use more rigorous methods and more diverse and representative participants. Specifically, future studies should target older adults, who are demonstrably lonely or socially isolated, or both, across a range of settings to determine whether video call interventions are effective in a population in which these outcomes are in need of improvement.",0
1592,"BACKGROUND.: Workers whose occupations put them in contact with infected persons and the public are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. RECOMMENDATIONS.: The Collegium Ramazzini calls on governments at all levels to protect worker health by strengthening public health systems; maintaining comprehensive social insurance systems; establishing policies that presume all COVID-19 infections in high-risk workers are work-related; enforcing all occupational health standards; and developing pandemic preparedness plans.The Collegium Ramazzini calls on all employers - large and small, public and private - to protect the health of all workers by developing disease preparedness plans; implementing basic infection control measures; establishing disease identification and isolation policies; reducing hazardous exposures; supporting personal protective equipment (PPE) programs; and restricting unnecessary travel. CONCLUSION.: Governments and employers have legal obligations to protect worker health. They are not relieved of these duties during pandemics.",0
1593,"An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and the number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and the uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the initial number of exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods, and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order for the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constrain the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, with a reproduction ratio R0 of 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22, and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15,600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit to the dead individuals is 4.25 days, and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57%, and it is 2.37% if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initial number of exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47%. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 vs. 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 vs. 0.57%), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit to the data, but some of the results may not be realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to knowledge of the precise bounds of the parameters. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing, and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, it is important to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.",0
1594,"OBJECTIVES: Public health officials need tools to assist in anticipating the healthcare resources required to confront the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. We constructed a modeling tool to aid active public health officials to estimate healthcare demand from the pandemic in their jurisdictions and to evaluate the potential impact of population-wide social-distancing interventions. METHODS: The tool uses an SEIR compartmental model to project the pandemic's local spread. Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate. Outputs include the number of infections and deaths with and without intervention, and the demand for hospital and critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity. We illustrate the tool using data from three regions of Chile. RESULTS: Our scenarios indicate a surge in COVID-19 patients could overwhelm Chilean hospitals by June, peaking in July or August at six to 50 times the current supply of beds and ventilators. A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals >70 years, and telework interventions may keep treatment demand below capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive interventions can avert substantial morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Our tool permits rapid evaluation of locally-applicable policy scenarios and updating of results as new data become available.",0
1595,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been accompanied by a variety of potentially stressful or traumatic experiences that people may face in daily life (e.g., repeated exposure to morbidity or mortality reports across media platforms, social isolation, contracting COVID-19, supply shortages, lost income, death of a loved one). As such, it is important to consider individual differences that may increase one's risk for developing stress-related disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder) or put the health of other people at risk. Individual differences in narcissism-a multifaceted aspect of personality-may be worth examining in association with social health behaviors, stress, and trauma-related outcomes during the current and future pandemics.

1596,"Background Governments and international organisations are focused on COVID-19 crisis decision-making. As a result, global and national health governance contexts are changing dramatically, as are the social and political determinants of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). Various gender dimensions of the pandemic are clear. While initial data suggest that men are more vulnerable to COVID-19 related mortality, in many high, middle, and low-income countries, the ""essential workers"" and informal workers who are disproportionately exposed are disproportionately lower social status women. (Boniol et al., 2019; Wenham et al., 2020) Intersecting injustices mean that certain disadvantaged groups are particularly hard hit. (Morgan & Davies, 2020) They are left to reconcile the often-incompatible demands of precarious jobs, potential exposure to COVID-19, the stress of caring responsibilities under lockdown and, particularly for women, increased isolation exacerbating Gender-Based Violence (GBV). (Roesch et al., 2020; Garijo, 2020) In addition, they now face seriously disrupted health care services for SRH care.",0
1597,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Governments have implemented combinations of 'lockdown' measures of various stringencies, including school and workplace closures, cancellations of public events, and restrictions on internal and external movements. These policy interventions are an attempt to shield high risk individuals and to prevent overwhelming countries' healthcare systems, or, colloquially, 'flatten the curve'. However, these policy interventions may come with physical and psychological health harms, group and social harms, and opportunity costs. These policies may particularly affect vulnerable populations and not only exacerbate pre-existing inequities, but also generate new ones. METHODS: We developed a conceptual framework to identify and categorise adverse effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures. We based our framework on Lorenc and Oliver's framework for the adverse effects of public health interventions and the PROGRESS-Plus equity framework. To test its application we purposively sampled COVID-19 policy examples from around the world and evaluated them for the potential physical, psychological, and social harms, as well as opportunity costs, in each of the PROGRESS-Plus equity domains: Place of residence, Race/ethnicity, Occupation, Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital, Plus (age, and disability). RESULTS: We found examples of inequitably distributed adverse effects for each COVID-19 lockdown policy example, stratified by LMIC and HIC, in every PROGRESS-Plus equity domain. We identified known policy interventions intended to mitigate some of these adverse effects. The same harms (anxiety; depression; food insecurity; loneliness; stigma; violence) appear to be repeated across many groups, and are exacerbated by several COVID-19 policy interventions. CONCLUSION: Our conceptual framework highlights the fact that COVID-19 policy interventions can generate or exacerbate interactive and multiplicative equity harms. Applying this framework can help in three ways: (1) identifying areas where a policy intervention may generate inequitable adverse effects; (2) mitigating policy and practice interventions by facilitating the systematic examination of relevant evidence; and (3) planning for lifting COVID-19 lockdowns and policy interventions around the world.",0
1598,"OBJECTIVES: To clarify the implementation status of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens in Japan during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study based on internet-based survey. A total of 2400 people (50% male: 20-79 years) were selected between February 25 and 27, 2020, from registrants of an Internet research company, to complete a questionnaire. Participants were asked to indicate how often they implemented the following five personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing measures, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation). In addition, the participants responded to questions regarding the daily frequency of hand hygiene events. RESULTS: The prevalence of the five personal protective measures ranged from 59.8% to 83.8%, with the lowest being avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. In total, 34.7% implemented all personal protective measures. The median daily hand hygiene events were 5 per day (25th percentile, 75th percentile: 3,8). CONCLUSIONS: The protective measures implemented by ordinary citizens are insufficient and further public awareness activities are required.",0
1599,"COVID-19 has revealed gaps in services and supports for older adults, even as needs for health and social services have dramatically increased and may produce a cascade of disability after the pandemic subsides. In this essay, we discuss the perfect storm of individual and environmental risk factors, including deconditioning, reductions in formal and informal care support, and social isolation. We then evaluate opportunities that have arisen for strengthening person-centered services and supports for older adults, through in-home acute and primary medical care, aggressive use of video telehealth and social interaction, and implementation of volunteer or paid intergenerational service.",0
1600,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has undoubtedly had a major impact on the provision of physical healthcare in Ireland and worldwide. The mental health impact of this pandemic cannot be underestimated, particularly relating to patients suffering from addiction. Heightened public stress and anxiety levels, increasing isolation and the physical consequences of addiction play a large role in the proliferation and ongoing relapse of substance misuse and behavioural addiction. Service provision is an ongoing challenge not only due to the increasing need for services given the increased mental health burden of COVID-19 but also the restrictions in place in clinical areas to achieve social distancing. The necessary adaptations to service provision provide opportunities for the analysis of current processes used in our addiction unit and the introduction of new processes to our service. The current crisis tests the sustainability of the service to provide the high standard of care required for these patients.",0
1601,"OBJECTIVE To estimate the proportion and total number of the general adult population who may be at higher risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil. METHODS We included 51,770 participants from a nationally representative, household-based health survey (PNS) conducted in Brazil. We estimated the proportion and number of adults (≥ 18 years) at risk of severe Covid-19 by sex, educational level, race/ethnicity, and state based on the presence of one or more of the following risk factors: age ≥ 65 years or medical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, stroke, chronic kidney disease and moderate to severe asthma, smoking status, and obesity. RESULTS Adults at risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil varied from 34.0% (53 million) to 54.5% (86 million) nationwide. Less-educated adults present a 2-fold higher prevalence of risk factors compared to university graduated. We found no differences by sex and race/ethnicity. São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul were the most vulnerable states in absolute and relative terms of adults at risk. CONCLUSIONS Proportion and total number of adults at risk of severe Covid-19 are high in Brazil, with wide variation across states and adult subgroups. These findings should be considered while designing and implementing prevention measures in Brazil. We argue that these results support broad social isolation measures, particularly when testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 is limited.",0
1602,"As there is no vaccination and proper medicine for treatment, the recent pandemic caused by COVID-19 has drawn attention to the strategies of quarantine and other governmental measures, like lockdown, media coverage on social isolation, and improvement of public hygiene, etc to control the disease. The mathematical model can help when these intervention measures are the best strategies for disease control as well as how they might affect the disease dynamics. Motivated by this, in this article, we have formulated a mathematical model introducing a quarantine class and governmental intervention measures to mitigate disease transmission. We study a thorough dynamical behavior of the model in terms of the basic reproduction number. Further, we perform the sensitivity analysis of the essential reproduction number and found that reducing the contact of exposed and susceptible humans is the most critical factor in achieving disease control. To lessen the infected individuals as well as to minimize the cost of implementing government control measures, we formulate an optimal control problem, and optimal control is determined. Finally, we forecast a short-term trend of COVID-19 for the three highly affected states, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, in India, and it suggests that the first two states need further monitoring of control measures to reduce the contact of exposed and susceptible humans.",0
1603,"BACKGROUND: Social distancing and shielding measures have been put in place to reduce social interaction and slow the transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool's feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. METHODS: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app's feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura's model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. RESULTS: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. CONCLUSIONS: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness.",0
1604,"OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we have faced unprecedented challenges in the delivery of surgical education. At the time of writing, changes to the structure and nature of the surgical workforce are occurring rapidly, even daily. Surgical educators are utilizing remote learning solutions, including flipped classroom approaches, online educational materials, telemedicine, and simulations, to continue education for surgical residents despite cancelations of face-to-face instruction. Our objective is to delineate an interdisciplinary strategy, utilizing the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), by which we can optimize learning during this pandemic. DESIGN: This perspective describes the UDL framework which can be used to situate solutions to issues with delivery of surgical education during this pandemic within the broader view of strategic inclusive instructional design to meet diverse learning needs.. CONCLUSION: The principles of UDL can inform curricular and pedagogical changes in surgical education that may be employed during a time of social distancing, isolation, and quarantine. UDL involves planning flexibility into curricular design from the outset, recognizing that learners are varied in their learning preferences and capabilities, motivational characteristics, and environmental constraints. Viewing the design of remote learning opportunities through the UDL lens aims to remove barriers to learning during this pandemic by targeting three areas: expansion of the means that information is communicated, ways that learners are supported and motivated, and approaches to assessing learning through available distance learning technologies.",0
1605,"The neuropeptide oxytocin has attracted great attention of the general public, basic neuroscience researchers, psychologists, and psychiatrists due to its profound pro-social, anxiolytic, and ""anti-stress"" behavioral and physiological effects, and its potential application for treatment of mental diseases associated with altered socio-emotional competence. During the last decade, substantial progress has been achieved in understanding the complex neurobiology of the oxytocin system, including oxytocinergic pathways, local release patterns, and oxytocin receptor distribution in the brain, as well as intraneuronal oxytocin receptor signaling. However, the picture of oxytocin actions remains far from being complete, and the central question remains: ""How does a single neuropeptide exert such pleotropic actions?"" Although this phenomenon, typical for many of about 100 identified neuropeptides, may emerge from the anatomical divergence of oxytocin neurons, their multiple central projections, distinct oxytocin-sensitive cell types in different brain regions, and multiple intraneuronal signaling pathways determining the specific cellular response, further basic studies are required. In conjunction, numerous reports on positive effects of intranasal application of oxytocin on human brain networks controlling socio-emotional behavior in health and disease require harmonic tandems of basic researchers and clinicians. During the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, oxytocin research seems central as question of social isolation-induced inactivation of the oxytocin system, and buffering effects of either activation of the endogenous system or intranasal application of synthetic oxytocin need to be thoroughly investigated.",0
1608,"Following the rapid dissemination of COVID-19 cases in Switzerland, large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented by the cantons and the federal government between 28 February and 20 March 2020. Estimates of the impact of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission are critical for decision making in this and future outbreaks. We here aim to assess the impact of these NPIs on disease transmission by estimating changes in the basic reproduction number (R0) at national and cantonal levels in relation to the timing of these NPIs. We estimated the time-varying R0 nationally and in eleven cantons by fitting a stochastic transmission model explicitly simulating within-hospital dynamics. We used individual-level data from more than 1000 hospitalised patients in Switzerland and public daily reports of hospitalisations and deaths. We estimated the national R0 to be 2.8 (95% confidence interval 2.1&ndash;3.8) at the beginning of the epidemic. Starting from around 7 March, we found a strong reduction in time-varying R0 with a 86% median decrease (95% quantile range [QR] 79&ndash;90%) to a value of 0.40 (95% QR 0.3&ndash;0.58) in the period of 29 March to 5 April. At the cantonal level, R0 decreased over the course of the epidemic between 53% and 92%. Reductions in time-varying R0 were synchronous with changes in mobility patterns as estimated through smartphone activity, which started before the official implementation of NPIs. We inferred that most of the reduction of transmission is attributable to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 4% of the total reduction in effective transmission. As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of time-varying R0 well below one are promising. However, as of 24 April 2020, at least 96% (95% QR 95.7&ndash;96.4%) of the Swiss population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. These results warrant a cautious relaxation of social distance practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers.",0
1609,"BACKGROUND: The global context we are experiencing, characterized by the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV2, imposes strict containment, isolation and physical distance measures, necessary to control and contain the risk of contagion. Despite social distances and isolation in this context of threat to Global Health, the sharing of experiences, professionalism, scientific research and Public Health strategies is fundamental. Never before has telemedicine played a decisive role in supporting the healthcare organization, The University Hospital Consortium Policlinico of Bari has launched an experimental partnership project with West China Hospital of Sichuan University through periodic and scheduled video conferences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Company Strategic Management, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Bari, Medical Executives of the Health Department, of the U.O of Infectious Diseases, Anesthesia and Resuscitation, Pulmonology, Emergency, Hygiene, Occupational Medicine, Psychiatry and Doctors Resident operating in the COVID Area. are involved in the Experimental Project., all adequately trained and instructed on the operating protocol. RESULTS: From the preliminary data of this study, it appears that the Bari Polyclinic has adopted the same therapeutic strategies started in China in the previous months, believing early diagnosis and treatment to be a strength in the battle against COVID-19. The project makes it possible to make the management of COVID-19 patients optimal, safe and better, using the experience acquired in the field by Chinese doctors who, first caught by this health emergency, have obtained positive results.",0
1610,"Social workers are familiar with the challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic; and we apply three gerontological social work perspectives that might increase our chances of minimizing negative outcomes and improving health and quality of life for everyone. First, the reality that the older population is very heterogeneous challenges ageism and age-stereotyping that has surfaced with COVID-19. Second, concepts of cumulative disadvantage and intersectionality offer clear explanations of the disparities that are being illuminated and lead us to advocate for fundamental changes to reduce disparities in later life and for people across the life course. Third, a strength-based perspective highlights the assets of the older population and the opportunities for positive developments coming out of the crisis. We can capitalize on momentum to increase advance care planning, to reduce social isolation, and expand the use of on-line technology for service provision. We can bolster our arguments to support older workers, volunteers, and caregivers. The fact that these social work perspectives are so applicable to the coronavirus situation reminds us of their fundamental relevance. Gerontological social work has much to offer in our roles as researchers, educators, practitioners, and advocates during this crisis, and our foundational principles serve us well.",0

The developed e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' offers manualized, evidence-based psychotherapeutic/psychological support to overcome psychological distress in times of COVID-19. E-mental health approaches offer great possibilities to support burdened people during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic effectively.",0
1612,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, and by 24 April 2020, it had affected >2.73 million people in 185 countries and caused >192,000 deaths. Despite diverse societal measures to reduce transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, such as implementing social distancing, quarantine, curfews and total lockdowns, its control remains challenging. Healthcare practitioners are at the frontline of defence against the virus, with increasing institutional and governmental supports. Nevertheless, new or ongoing clinical trials, not related to the disease itself, remain important for the development of new therapies, and require interactions among patients, clinicians and research personnel, which is challenging, given isolation measures. In this article, the authors summarise the acute effects and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on current cardiovascular trials.",0
1613,"In the early stages of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, containment of disease importation from epidemic areas was essential for outbreak control. This study is based on publicly accessible data on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan extracted from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control website. We analysed the characteristics, infection source, symptom presentation, and route of identification of the 321 imported cases that were identified from 21 January to 6 April 2020. They were mostly returned Taiwanese citizens who had travelled to one or more of 37 countries for tourism, business, work, or study. Half of these cases developed symptoms before arrival, most of the remainder developed symptoms 1-13 days (mean 4.0 days) after arrival, and 3.4% never developed symptoms. Three-quarters of the cases had respiratory symptoms, 44.9% had fever, 13.1% lost smell or taste, and 7.2% had diarrhoea. Body temperature and symptom screening at airports identified 32.7% of the cases. Of the remainder, 27.7% were identified during home quarantining, 16.2% were identified via contact tracing, and 23.4% were reported by hospitals. Under the strict enforcement of these measures, the incidence of locally acquired COVID-19 cases in Taiwan remains sporadic. In conclusion, proactive border control measures are effective for preventing community transmission of this disease.",0
1614,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is endangering human health worldwide; scarcity of published pediatric cases and current literature and the absence of evidence-based guidelines necessitate international sharing of experience and personal communication. On 31 March 2020 the International Committee of the American Thoracic Society Pediatrics Assembly recorded an online podcast, during which pediatric pulmonologists worldwide shared their experience on the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in children. The aim was to share personal experience in organizing pediatric care in different health care settings globally, protecting health care workers, and isolation practices. This manuscript summarizes the common themes of the podcast which centered around three main topics: more benign clinical disease and progression in pediatric cases compared to adults, a strong need for strategies to protect health care workers, and social or economic disparities as a barrier to successful pandemic control.",0
1615,"COVID-19 fatalities exemplify ""bad deaths"" and are distinguished by physical discomfort, difficulty breathing, social isolation, psychological distress, and care that may be discordant with the patient's preferences. Each of these death attributes is a well-documented correlate of bereaved survivors' symptoms of depression, anxiety, and anger. Yet the grief experienced by survivors of COVID-related deaths is compounded by the erosion of coping resources like social support, contemporaneous stressors including social isolation, financial precarity, uncertainty about the future, lack of routine, and the loss of face-to-face mourning rituals that provide a sense of community and uplift. National efforts to enhance advance care planning may help dying patients to receive care that is concordant with the preferences of them and their families. Virtual funeral services, pairing bereaved elders with a telephone companion, remote counseling, and encouraging ""continuing bonds"" may help older adults adapt to loss in the time of pandemic.",0
1617,"Novel coronavirus spreads very fast and is not easy to control. It has spread over 200 countries or territories. China has taken action to implement containment strategies, including active COVID-19 case finding, tracing, and 14-day quarantine of close contacts, and home isolation of 1.39 billion of people countywide for at least 2 weeks, etc. The combination of these strategies has brought the epidemic under control in China. The United Kingdom had deliberately not implemented containment measures for a while, instead opting to allow herd immunity strategy to develop over time. This is a ""do-nothing"" strategy whereby the virus is allowed to move through communities naturally until certain proportion of people has been infected, and the epidemic ends without intervention. The author assesses containment strategies versus this herd immunity strategy in real-world application to the COVID-19 epidemic. The author suggests an innovative strategy to balance controlling the epidemic and preventing impediment to economic and social development.",0
1618,"BACKGROUND: Psychophysiological stress and decreased well-being are relevant issues during prolonged social isolation periods. Relaxation practices may represent helpful exercises to cope with anxiety and stressful sensations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research protocol is to test whether remote relaxation practices such as natural sounds, deep respiration, and body scan meditation promote relaxation and improved emotional state and reduce psychomotor activation and the preoccupation related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: The study population will consist of 3 experimental groups that will randomly receive one of 3 internet-based audio clips containing a single session of guided breathing exercise, guided body scan exercise, or natural sounds. The participants will listen to the fully automated audio clip for 7 minutes and complete pre-post self-assessment scales on their perceived relaxation, psychomotor activation, level of worry associated with COVID-19, and emotional state. At the end of the session, the participants will also be asked to provide qualitative reports on their subjective experiences. RESULTS: Analyses will be performed to test the differences in the efficacy of the different audio clips in an internet-based intervention on 252 participants (84 per group), investigating whether natural sounds or remote guided practices such as deep respiration and body scan meditation positively enhance the participants' perceived psychological state. CONCLUSIONS: The study will provide information on if and to what extent guided practices can help in reducing psychological side effects related to social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1619,"The current pandemic has forced many people into self-isolation and to practice social distancing. When people are physically isolated and distant from each other, technology may play a fundamental role by enabling social connection and reducing feelings of loneliness caused by this prolonged social isolation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many mental health services worldwide have had to shift their routine face-to-face outpatient appointments to remote telepsychiatry encounters. The increased pressure on mental health services highlights the importance of community-led health-promotion interventions, which can contribute to preventing mental illness or their relapses, and to reduce the burden on health services. Patients with psychosis are particularly socially isolated, have sedentary lifestyles, and commonly face stigma and discrimination from the general population. At the same time, patients with psychosis value technology, are interested in, use and own smart-phones to digitally connect, and are satisfied with their use. Thus, among psychosocial interventions, a helpful resource may be ""Phone Pal,"" a complex intervention which facilitates remote communication between volunteers and socially isolated patients with psychosis through different smart-phone tools. While ""Phone Pal"" has been originally developed for people with psychosis, it may also be useful to the wider population, helping to overcome the social isolation caused by physical distancing, particularly in these times of widespread isolation. ""Phone Pal"" may be a potential public health resource for society, providing important support to those that may need it the most, and possibly benefit most from it.",0
1620,"Background The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) caused a major public health crisis worldwide and challenged healthcare systems across the six continents. The high infectivity of the disease led many governments to adopt strict regulations and measures with the aim of containing its spread. The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence, severity, and territorial expansion of COVID-19. Methods Data from the World Health Organization was screened, and COVID-19 situation reports were extracted from January 21 up till March 14 (inclusive). Our data included the total number of cases, total number of new cases, total number of cured cases, and total number of related deaths. Percentage change of cases over the days of our study were calculated using the Joinpoint regression, with a significance level set at greater than 0.05. Results The total number of COVID-19 cases reached 156,622, with 5,845 subsequent deaths. China, Italy, and Iran have the highest number of cases worldwide. During the first 22 days, the incidence rate of COVID-19 increased significantly to reach 1.81 cases per million persons (p<0.001). That was followed by a significant decrease over the next 11 days (p<0.001) to reach 0.071 cases per million persons. A steady rise then followed, which saw a significant increase in incidence rate to 1.429 cases per million persons (p<0.001). Percentages of death and cured cases varied across the different countries; nevertheless, death percentages have generally been decreasing since the start of the crisis. Conclusion Adopting precautionary regulations such as social isolation, increasing sanitation, and employing strict quarantine measures have proved to be beneficial in containing the virus. Further research needs to be conducted to help discover therapeutic modalities and improve outcomes.",0
1621,"Human behaviour is central to transmission of SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and changing behaviour is crucial to preventing transmission in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions. Isolation and social distancing measures, including edicts to stay at home, have been brought into place across the globe to reduce transmission of the virus, but at a huge cost to individuals and society. In addition to these measures, we urgently need effective interventions to increase adherence to behaviours that individuals in communities can enact to protect themselves and others: use of tissues to catch expelled droplets from coughs or sneezes, use of face masks as appropriate, hand-washing on all occasions when required, disinfecting objects and surfaces, physical distancing, and not touching one's eyes, nose or mouth. There is an urgent need for direct evidence to inform development of such interventions, but it is possible to make a start by applying behavioural science methods and models.",0
1623,"Respiratory symptoms, especially the development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, dominate the discussion and initial concerns of the population and health professionals. However, the cardiovascular system is greatly affected by these conditions and is often responsible for complications and mortality of these patients. In order to show the cardiovascular implications in patients infected with COVID-19 and the importance of social isolation as an alternative to curb the spread of the disease, a literature review was carried out based on 37 articles, in English, Portuguese and Spanish, available on Scielo and PubMed. The findings showed that cardiac complications associated with COVID-19 infection are similar to those produced by: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and influenza. However, COVID-19 has a much greater and faster contamination and, unlike influenza, there is no vaccine or treatment available yet. In view of this, social isolation becomes a tool that can reduce and flatten the curve of cases and thus protect the people at higher risk, decreasing the chances of serious conditions related to the disease, potential deaths and the collapse of the country's health system.",0
1624,"Deaths due to COVID-19 are associated with risk factors which can lead to prolonged grief disorder, post-traumatic stress, and other poor bereavement outcomes among relatives, as well as moral injury and distress in frontline staff. Here we review relevant research evidence and provide evidence-based recommendations and resources for hospital clinicians to mitigate poor bereavement outcomes and support staff. For relatives, bereavement risk factors include dying in an intensive care unit, severe breathlessness, patient isolation or restricted access, significant patient and family emotional distress, and disruption to relatives' social support networks. Recommendations include advance care planning; proactive, sensitive, and regular communication with family members alongside accurate information provision; enabling family members to say goodbye in person where possible; supporting virtual communication; providing excellent symptom management and emotional and spiritual support; and providing and/or sign-posting to bereavement services. To mitigate effects of this emotionally challenging work on staff, we recommend an organizational and systemic approach which includes access to informal and professional support.",0
1625,"AIMS: Rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases world-wide has made diabetes an important comorbidity in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). We sought to review the risk, severity and mortality in COVID-19 and its relation to the glycemic control, and role of anti-diabetic agents in patients with diabetes. METHODS: A Boolean search was made in PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar database until May 10, 2020 and full articles with supplementary appendix were retrieved using the specific key words related to the topic. RESULTS: There is a high prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19. Patients with diabetes had a significantly more severe variety of COVID-19 and increased mortality, compared to the groups without diabetes. Moreover, poor glycemic control is associated with a significantly higher severe COVID-19 and increased mortality, compared to the well-controlled glycemic groups. No data currently available for or against any anti-diabetic agents in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes, in particular poorly-controlled group is associated with a significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality. This calls for an optimal glycemic control and an increased emphasis on future preventative therapies including the vaccination programs for these groups in addition to the traditional risk prevention such as social distancing and self-isolation.",0
1626,"The SARS-COVID-19 pandemic is bringing to light significant issues that require deliberations on how to manage patients at high cardiovascular risk or with proven heart disease. The evidence that the hospital can be a place where one might contract the infection and spread the disease has drastically reduced non-COVID-19 accesses to emergency rooms (ER) and to elective non-COVID-19 hospital activities. If this, on one hand, results in reducing improper access to the ER and hospital, on the other hand it substantiates the risk of underestimating problems not connected to COVID-19, such as an increased delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular emergencies. In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital. The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments. Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management. A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients.",0
1627,"To assess the effectiveness of response strategies of avoiding large gatherings or crowded areas and to predict the spread of COVID-19 infections in Japan, we developed a stochastic transmission model by extending the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemiological model with an additional modeling of the individual action on whether to stay away from the crowded areas. The population were divided into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected, Removed. Susceptible transitions to Infected every hour with a probability determined by the ratio of Infected and the congestion of area. The total area consists of three zones crowded zone, mid zone and uncrowded zone, with different infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there. The time for each people to spend in the crowded zone is curtailed by 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 hours, and the time spent in mid zone is extended accordingly. This simulation showed that the number of Infected and Removed will increase rapidly if there is no reduction of the time spent in crowded zone. On the other hand, the stagnant growth of Infected can be observed when the time spent in the crowded zone is reduced to 4 hours, and the growth number of Infected will decrease and the spread of the infection will subside gradually if the time spent in the crowded zone is further cut to 2 hours. In conclusions The infection spread in Japan will be gradually contained by reducing the time spent in the crowded zone to less than 4 hours.",0
1628,"We describe the case of a young man admitted due to mild COVID-19 infection. During his hospitalization in an isolation ward, he had no respiratory distress or fever but developed symptoms consistent with anxiety and insomnia. Despite the appropriate supportive intervention, on hospital day 7, he attempted suicide by jumping from the third-floor ward. The patient underwent urgent surgery and was transferred to a level I trauma center under strict isolation. Our findings emphasize the importance of the mental health aspects of patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic. LEARNING POINTS: The COVID-19 pandemic requires social distancing, quarantine and isolation, which may precipitate new psychiatric symptoms in people without mental illness or aggravate existing conditions.Mental health service providers, including psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and social workers, should be available in every facility taking care of COVID-19 patients.Health workers treating patients during the COVID-19 pandemic should be aware of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and/or distress developing in their patients and colleagues.",0
1629,"OBJECTIVES: To clarify changes in the implementation of personal protective measures among ordinary Japanese citizens from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak to the community transmission phase. METHODS: This longitudinal, internet-based survey included 2141 people (50.8% men; 20-79 years). The baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted from February 25-27, 2020, and April 1-6, 2020, respectively. Participants were asked how often they implemented the five personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation) in the baseline and follow-up surveys. RESULTS: Three of the five personal protective measures' availability significantly improved during the community transmission phase compared to the early phase. Social distancing measures showed significant improvement, from 67.4% to 82.2%. However, the prevalence of avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth, which had the lowest prevalence in the early phase, showed no significant improvement (approximately 60%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that men and persons of low-income households made fewer improvements than women and persons of high-income households. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens is improving; however, there is potential for improvement, especially concerning avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth.",0
1630,"COVID-19 has created enormous challenges for health systems worldwide, with the rapidly growing number of deaths and critical patients with pneumonia requiring ventilatory support. Alternative methods to control the spread of the disease such as social isolation, extreme quarantine measures, and contact tracing have been used around the world. However, these measures may not be totally effective to fight COVID-19, in step with the necessary national preparations to meet the new patient care demands. A wide range of digital technologies can be used to enhance these public health strategies, and the pandemic has sparked increasing use of telehealth. This field has grown considerably in Brazil in recent years. Still, despite the intense proliferation of recommendations and rules, until the current pandemic the country still lacked a fully consolidated regulatory framework. The emergence of COVID-19 marks a key moment in the expansion of applications and use of telehealth for improving the health system's response to the current crisis. The article discusses telehealth's contribution to the fight against COVID-19 and the recent initiatives triggered in Brazil as opportunities for the consolidation of telemedicine and improvement of the Brazilian Unified National Health System. The authors conclude that telehealth offers capabilities for remote screening, care and treatment, and assists monitoring, surveillance, detection, prevention, and mitigation of the impacts on healthcare indirectly related to COVID-19. The initiatives triggered in this process can reshape the future space of telemedicine in health services in the territory.",0
1631,"Although COVID-19 is a physical illness, it has had large impacts on mental health. For many individuals, social distancing has led to social isolation; individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders are at a particular risk for negative outcomes due to the global pandemic.

1632,"Italy is one of the major COVID-19 hotspots. To reduce the spread of the infections and the pressure on Italian healthcare systems, since March 10, 2020, Italy has been under a total lockdown, forcing people into home confinement. Here we present data from 1,310 people living in the Italian territory (Mage  = 23.91 ± 3.60 years, 880 females, 501 workers, 809 university students), who completed an online survey from March 24 to March 28, 2020. In the survey, we asked participants to think about their use of digital media before going to bed, their sleep pattern and their subjective experience of time in the previous week (March 17-23, which was the second week of the lockdown) and up to the first week of February (February 3-10, before any restriction in any Italian area). During the lockdown, people increased the usage of digital media near bedtime, but this change did not affect sleep habits. Nevertheless, during home confinement, sleep timing markedly changed, with people going to bed and waking up later, and spending more time in bed, but, paradoxically, also reporting a lower sleep quality. The increase in sleep difficulties was stronger for people with a higher level of depression, anxiety and stress symptomatology, and associated with the feeling of elongation of time. Considering that the lockdown is likely to continue for weeks, research data are urgently needed to support decision making, to build public awareness and to provide timely and supportive psychosocial interventions.",0
1633,"By April 7th, 2020, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected one and a half million people worldwide, accounting for over 80 thousand of deaths in 209 countries and territories around the world. The new and fast dynamics of the pandemic are challenging the health systems of different countries. In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, mitigation policies, such as social isolation and lock-down of cities, have been adopted, but the results vary among different countries. Some countries were able to control the disease at the moment, as is the case of South Korea. Others, like Italy, are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic. Finally, countries with emerging economies and social issues, like Brazil, are in the initial phase of the pandemic. In this work, we use mathematical models with time-dependent coefficients, techniques of inverse and forward uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis to characterize essential aspects of the COVID-19 in the three countries mentioned above. The model parameters estimated for South Korea revealed effective social distancing and isolation policies, border control, and a high number in the percentage of reported cases. In contrast, underreporting of cases was estimated to be very high in Brazil and Italy. In addition, the model estimated a poor isolation policy at the moment in Brazil, with a reduction of contact around 40%, whereas Italy and South Korea estimated numbers for contact reduction are at 75% and 90%, respectively. This characterization of the COVID-19, in these different countries under different scenarios and phases of the pandemic, supports the importance of mitigation policies, such as social distancing. In addition, it raises serious concerns for socially and economically fragile countries, where underreporting poses additional challenges to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by significantly increasing the uncertainties regarding its dynamics.",0
1635,"BACKGROUND: Voluntary individual quarantine and voluntary active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies for emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Given the impact of quarantine on resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions individual quarantine can more effectively control COVID-19 than active monitoring. As an epidemic grows, it is also important to consider when these interventions are no longer feasible, and broader mitigation measures must be implemented. METHODS: To estimate the comparative efficacy of these case-based interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model to reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Specifically, we fit to the incubation period distribution and each of two sets of the serial interval distribution: a shorter one with a mean serial interval of 4.8 days and a longer one with a mean of 7.5 days. To assess variable resource settings, we consider two feasibility settings: a high feasibility setting with 90% of contacts traced, a half-day average delay in tracing and symptom recognition, and 90% effective isolation; and low feasibility setting with 50% of contacts traced, a two-day average delay, and 50% effective isolation. FINDINGS: Our results suggest that individual quarantine in high feasibility settings where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined contains an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) 84% of the time. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. When resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to mitigation efforts. INTERPRETATION: Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts. To the extent these interventions can be implemented they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.",0
1636,"Pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 is the largest of its kind of this century. All countries throughout the globe are trying their best to contain the disease and eliminate at the earliest. Efforts are continuing to improve the outcome of the infection in terms of minimizing the morbidity and mortality. As a public health strategy every state has the responsibility of protecting the health of the community and such measures includes the preventive measures like social distancing or even lockdown of the state as a whole restricting the movement of the people, diagnostic measures like testing the suspects, contact tracing and isolation of the patients. Treatment of the infected requires decisions in resource constraint situation particularly ICU beds and ventilators. In the meantime, protecting doctors, nurses, other health workers as well as frontline workers need personal protective equipment which is a scarce commodity. While doing so there might be a compromise in the individual autonomy, privacy, confidentiality, and social justice for the beneficence for the larger community. This is an attempt to explore the ethical quandaries in relation to combating COVID-19 in Nepal by relating the issues with the principles of biomedical ethics.",0

Nepal has implemented several containment measures such as Rapid Response Team formulation; testing; isolation; quarantine; contact tracing;surveillance, establishment of COVID-19 Crisis Management Centre and designation of dedicated hospitals to gear up for the pandemic. The national public health emergency management mechanisms need further strengthening with the proactive engagement of relevant ministries; we need a strong, real-time national surveillance system and capacity building of a critical mass of health care workers; there is a need to further assess infection prevention and control capacity; expand the network of virus diagnostic laboratories in the private sector with adequate surge capacity;implement participatory community engagement interventions and plan for a phased lockdown exit strategy enabling sustainable suppression of transmission at low-level and enabling in resuming some parts of economic and social life.",0
1639,"Countries throughout the world are counting the health and socioeconomic costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the strategies necessary to contain it. Profound consequences from social isolation are beginning to emerge, and there is an urgency about charting a path to recovery, albeit to a 'new normal' that mitigates them. Children have not suffered as much from the direct effects of COVID-19 infection as older adults. Still, there is mounting evidence that their health and welfare are being adversely affected. Closure of schools has been a critical component of social isolation but has a far broader impact than the diminution of educational opportunities, as important as these are. Reopening of schools is therefore essential to recovery, with some countries already tentatively implementing it. Children's interests are vital considerations in any recovery plan, but the question remains as to how to address them within the context of how society views children; should they be regarded as pawns, pathfinders or partners in this enterprise?",0

1641,"Introduction: U.S. commercial drivers are entrenched in a stressogenic profession, and exposures to endemic chronic stressors shape drivers' behavioral and psychosocial responses and induce profound health and safety disparities. To gain a complete understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect commercial driver stress, health, and safety over time, and to mitigate these impacts, research and prevention efforts must be grounded in theoretical perspectives that contextualize these impacts within the chronic stressors already endemic to profession, the historical and ongoing forces that have induced them, and the potentially reinforcing nature of the resulting afflictions. Methods: Extant literature reveals how an array of macro-level changes has shaped downstream trucking industry policies, resulting in stressogenic work organization and workplace characteristics. Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates existing stressors and introduces novel stressors, with potentially exacerbatory impacts on health and safety disparities. Results: As COVID-19 exerts an array of multi-level stressors on commercial drivers, syndemic frameworks can provide the appropriate theoretical lens to guide research and prevention. Syndemic frameworks can provide the grounding to allow foregoing commercial driver COVID-19 research to transcend the limitations of prevailing research frameworks by contextualizing COVID-19 stressors holistically within the complex system of endemic chronic stressors and interrelated health and safety afflictions. Syndemic-informed prevention efforts can then be implemented that simultaneously tackle multiple afflictions and the macro-level forces that result in the emergence of commercial drivers' health and safety disparities over time. Conclusions: The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial drivers cannot be adequately understood or acted upon in isolation from the endemic chronic stressors and interrelated health and safety disparities that characterize the profession. Instead, commercial driver COVID-19 research and prevention needs syndemic frameworks to holistically understand the impacts of COVID-19 on commercial driver stress, health, and safety, and to identify high-leverage preventive actions.",0
1643,"The physical and social isolation measures associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, although certainly necessary to contain the spread of the virus, represent a particularly distressing aspect that might accentuate the fears and pain associated with the disease, especially for patients, their family members, and health-care professionals. Affiliative responses to the crises are emerging as ad hoc or formally endorsed practices within COVID-19 facilities in Italy, aimed at establishing links of communication between patients and family members by using new communication technologies. Tending to the emotional needs of patients and mending the affiliative connections interrupted by the disease are good examples of interdisciplinary cohesion and affiliative responses to the COVID-19 emergency.

1645,"Objective: The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only caused particularly large public health problems, but also caused great psychological distress, especially for medical staff. We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: Medical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers. The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms. We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms. Result: There were a total of 1,563 participants in our study. Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ≥ 8). A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0-7.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0-2.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6-3.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3-3.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3-8.5). Conclusion: Our study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor. Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various sociopsychological factors at play in this situation.",0
1646,"A novel coronavirus pneumonia, first identified in Wuhan City and referred to as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, has been quickly spreading to other cities and countries. To control the epidemic, the Chinese government mandated a quarantine of the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020. To explore the effectiveness of the quarantine of the Wuhan city against this epidemic, transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been estimated. A well-mixed ""susceptible exposed infectious recovered"" (SEIR) compartmental model was employed to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic based on epidemiological characteristics of individuals, clinical progression of COVID-19, and quarantine intervention measures of the authority. Considering infected individuals as contagious during the latency period, the well-mixed SEIR model fitting results based on the assumed contact rate of latent individuals are within 6-18, which represented the possible impact of quarantine and isolation interventions on disease infections, whereas other parameter were suppose as unchanged under the current intervention. The present study shows that, by reducing the contact rate of latent individuals, interventions such as quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the potential peak number of COVID-19 infections and delay the time of peak infection.",0
1647,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the response to the pandemic are combining to produce a tidal wave of need for rehabilitation. Rehabilitation will be needed for survivors of COVID-19, many of whom are older, with underlying health problems. In addition, rehabilitation will be needed for those who have become deconditioned as a result of movement restrictions, social isolation, and inability to access healthcare for pre-existing or new non-COVID-19 illnesses. Delivering rehabilitation in the same way as before the pandemic will not be practical, nor will this approach meet the likely scale of need for rehabilitation. This commentary reviews the likely rehabilitation needs of older people both with and without COVID-19 and discusses how strategies to deliver effective rehabilitation at scale can be designed and implemented in a world living with COVID-19.",0
1650,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat COVID-19 transmission have worked to slow the spread of the epidemic but can have high socio-economic costs. It is critical we understand the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions to choose a safe exit strategy. Many current models are not suitable for assessing exit strategies because they do not account for epidemic resurgence when social distancing ends prematurely (e.g., statistical curve fits) nor permit scenario exploration in specific locations. We developed an SEIR-type mechanistic epidemiological model of COVID-19 dynamics to explore temporally variable non-pharmaceutical interventions. We provide an interactive tool and code to estimate the transmission parameter, β, and the effective reproduction number, R eff . We fit the model to Santa Clara County, California, where an early epidemic start date and early shelter-in-place orders could provide a model for other regions. As of April 22, 2020, we estimate an R eff of 0.982 (95% CI: 0.849 - 1.107) in Santa Clara County. After June 1 (the end-date for Santa Clara County shelter-in-place as of April 27), we estimate a shift to partial social distancing, combined with rigorous testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals, is a viable alternative to indefinitely maintaining shelter-in-place. We also estimate that if Santa Clara County had waited one week longer before issuing shelter-in-place orders, 95 additional people would have died by April 22 (95% CI: 7 - 283). Given early life-saving shelter-in-place orders in Santa Clara County, longer-term moderate social distancing and testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals have the potential to contain the size and toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in Santa Clara County, and may be effective in other locations.",0
1651,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has created a global context likely to increase eating disorder (ED) risk and symptoms, decrease factors that protect against EDs, and exacerbate barriers to care. Three pathways exist by which this pandemic may exacerbate ED risk. One, the disruptions to daily routines and constraints to outdoor activities may increase weight and shape concerns, and negatively impact eating, exercise, and sleeping patterns, which may in turn increase ED risk and symptoms. Relatedly, the pandemic and accompanying social restrictions may deprive individuals of social support and adaptive coping strategies, thereby potentially elevating ED risk and symptoms by removing protective factors. Two, increased exposure to ED-specific or anxiety-provoking media, as well as increased reliance on video conferencing, may increase ED risk and symptoms. Three, fears of contagion may increase ED symptoms specifically related to health concerns, or by the pursuit of restrictive diets focused on increasing immunity. In addition, elevated rates of stress and negative affect due to the pandemic and social isolation may also contribute to increasing risk. Evaluating and assessing these factors are key to better understanding the impact of the pandemic on ED risk and recovery and to inform resource dissemination and targets.",0
1652,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged disease that has become a global public health concern as it rapidly spread around the world. The etiologic agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a pandemic in 2002. This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery. By 17 April 2020, globally there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases with 139,378 deaths because of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 shows several similarities with SARS?CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with its clinical presentations. This can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and mortality. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) screening is considered as the standard laboratory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures throughout the world. Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment. Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks.

In addition, 48.2% feels stressed, 46.6% of the respondents confirmed to be feeling in a bad mood, and 47.4% do not stop thinking throughout the day about this epidemic and how to protect themselves. In addition, the study shows that 87.9% of the respondents in Algeria found it difficult to follow the confinement instructions. A significant change in the habits of the population was noted especially for the time of going to bed, the time of waking up, and the use of the Internet as well as the hours devoted to daily reading.",0
1665,"COVID-19 is a world health emergency which may inevitably affect the management of a complex autoimmune disease such as systemic sclerosis (SSc). Several SSc patients are frail and, in this pandemic, need a careful protection. The COVID-19 infection might complicate the clinical scenario of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in SSc because it determines a severe pneumonia characterized by radiological features similar to SSc-ILD. The striking CT similarities between the 2 diseases make it difficult to distinguish a worsening of SSc-ILD from COVID-19-ILD superinfection. Moreover, other aspects, like isolation during lock down, may cause a significant psychological stress which will pile up on the already difficult contact with the patients for a routine check-up. Moreover, the drug shortage is a real problem in these times. For these reasons, the rheumatologist in daily clinical practice should carefully differentiate the possible COVID-19 infection in order to optimize the patient management. Therefore, the challenge in everyday life will be to achieve in due time the differential diagnosis as well as the long-term psychological impact.Key Points• SSc patients should be encouraged to continue their chronic therapy; in case of immunosuppressive therapy it must be discontinued for safety in case of COVID-19 infection.• Psychological support must be guaranteed to every SSc patients.• COVID-19 pneuminia is hard to distinguish from an interstitial lung disease due to SSc lung involvment.• Data sharing is fundamental for an optimal managment of SSc patients during COVID-19 pandemia.",0
1666,"The Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is one of the most devastating in this century. It originated in China in December 2019 caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus, and in less than a month it had been classified as an ""International Public Health Emergency"". To date there are nearly 3 million people infected and more than 250,000 deaths caused by the disease worldwide. Initially it affects the respiratory tract with atypical pneumonia and in severe cases it produces systemic inflammation with cytokine storm that can cause rapid deterioration with circulatory and respiratory failure, coagulopathy and a lethality rate of approximately 7%. In Mexico, the first case was detected in February 2020, and to date there are 26,616 confirmed cases and 2,961 deaths throughout the country. The low number of diagnostic tests conducted in our country clearly underestimates the real incidence and impact of the disease. The most affected groups are those with risk factors such as age over 60, presence of hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Of the confirmed cases, 15% are healthcare workers. There is no specific treatment or vaccine yet, so it is important to have hygiene, social isolation and personal protection measures. Health, social and economic consequences could have great impact in the near future.",0
1667,"We investigate the age structured data for the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. We consider a mathematical model for the epidemic with unreported infectious patient with and without age structure. In particular, we build a new mathematical model and a new computational method to fit the data by using age classes dependent exponential growth at the early stage of the epidemic. This allows to take into account differences in the response of patients to the disease according to their age. This model also allows for a heterogeneous response of the population to the social distancing measures taken by the local government. We fit this model to the observed data and obtain a snapshot of the effective transmissions occurring inside the population at different times, which indicates where and among whom the disease propagates after the start of public mitigation measures.",0
1668,"The basic reproduction number is the average number of people to whom an infected person transmits the infection when virtually all individuals in a population are susceptible. We sought to calculate the current reproduction number for COVID-19 for each state in the United States. For the entire United States, the reproduction number declined from 4.02 to 1.51 between March 17 and April 1, 2020. We also found that the reproduction number for COVID-19 has declined in most states over the past two weeks which suggests that social isolation measures may be having a beneficial effect.",0
1670,"Traditional compartmental models such as SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) assume that the epidemic transmits in a homogeneous population, but the real contact patterns in epidemics are heterogeneous. Employing a more realistic model that considers heterogeneous contact is consequently necessary. Here, we use a contact network to reconstruct unprotected, protected contact, and airborne spread to simulate the two-stages outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) on the ""Diamond Princess"" cruise ship. We employ Bayesian inference and Metropolis-Hastings sampling to estimate the model parameters and quantify the uncertainties by the ensemble simulation technique. During the early epidemic with intensive social contacts, the results reveal that the average transmissibility                          t                      was 0.026 and the basic reproductive number                                                       R                             0                                               was 6.94, triple that in the WHO report, indicating that all people would be infected in one month. The                          t                      and                                                       R                             0                                               decreased to 0.0007 and 0.2 when quarantine was implemented. The reconstruction suggests that diluting the airborne virus concentration in closed settings is useful in addition to isolation, and high-risk susceptible should follow rigorous prevention measures in case exposed. This study can provide useful implications for control and prevention measures for the other cruise ships and closed settings.",0
1671,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation demands a lot from citizens, health care providers, and governmental institutions. Citizens need to cope with guidelines on social interaction, work, home isolation, and symptom recognition. Additionally, health care providers and policy makers have to cope with unprecedented and unpredictable pressure on the health care system they need to manage. By providing citizens with an app, they always have access to the latest information and can assess their own health. This data could be used to support policy makers and health care providers to get valuable insights in the regional distribution of infection load and health care consumption. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this observational study is to assess people's use of an app to support them with COVID-19 education, self-assessment, and monitoring of their own health for a 7-day period. In addition, we aim to assess the usability of this data for health care providers and policy makers by applying it to an interactive map and combining it with hospital data. The secondary outcomes of the study were user's satisfaction with the information provided in the app, perceived usefulness of the app, health care providers they contacted, and the follow-up actions from this contact. METHODS: This observational cohort study was carried out at the nonacademic teaching hospital ""Elisabeth Twee Steden"" (ETZ) in Tilburg, Netherlands. From April 1, 2020, onwards ETZ offered the COVID-19 education, self-assessment, and symptom tracking diary to their already existing app for patient education and monitoring. RESULTS: Between April 1 and April 20, 2020, a total of 6194 people downloaded the app. The self-assessment functionality was used abundantly to check one's health status. In total, 5104 people responded to the question about severe symptoms, from which 242 indicated to suffer from severe symptoms. A total of 4929 people responded to the question about mild symptoms, from which 3248 indicated to suffer from these. The data was successfully applied to an interactive map, displaying user demographics and health status. Furthermore, the data was linked to clinical data. App users were satisfied with the information in the app and appreciated the symptom diary functionality. In total, 102 users reached out to a health care provider, leading to 91 contacts. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the successful implementation and use of an app with COVID-19 education, self-assessment, and a 7-day symptom diary. Data collected with the app were successfully applied to an interactive map. In addition, we were able to link the data to COVID-19 screening results from the hospital's microbiology laboratory. This data could be used to support policy makers and health care providers to get valuable insights in the regional distribution of infection load and health care consumption.

1672,"The novel coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) pandemic has spread rapidly, from December to the end of March, to 185 countries, and there have been over 3,000,000 cases identified and over 200,000 deaths. For a proportion of hospitalized patients, death can occur within a few days, mainly for adult respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. In these patients, clinical signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory abnormalities, suggest a cytokine storm syndrome in response to the viral infection. No current targeted treatment is yet available for COVID-19, an unknown disease up to 2 months ago, which challenges doctors and researchers to find new drugs or reallocate other treatments for these patients. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, a growing body of information on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has emerged, mainly based on preliminary experience on retrospective studies or small case series. Antivirals, antimalarials, corticosteroids, biotechnological and small molecules, convalescent plasma and anticoagulants are among the drugs proposed for the treatment or in tested for COVID-19. Given the complexity of this new condition, a multidisciplinary management seems to be the best approach. Sharing and integrating knowledge between specialists, to evaluate the correct timing and setting of every treatment, could greatly benefit our patients. We reviewed the literature, combining it with our experiences and our specialist knowledge, to propose a management algorithm, correlating the clinical features with laboratory and imaging findings to establish the right timing for each treatment.Key Points• Critically ill COVID-19 patients show signs of cytokine storm syndrome.• No current targeted therapy is available, but a lot of drugs are in tested.• A multidisciplinary approach is crucial to manage COVID-19.• Choosing the correct timing of treatment is of pivotal importance to avoid the most severe complications.",0
1674,"The practice of radiation oncology requires stringent adherence to specific steps and principles designed to minimize exposure of an individual to unnecessary doses of radiation. The basic principles of such measures to reduce the risk of exposure and limit the doses of irradiation follow the ""as low as reasonably achievable "" or ALARA principle by using the concepts of time, distance and shielding. Potential exposures in radiation oncology are controlled through combination of optimal design and installation of radiation delivery equipment with well-defined standard operating procedures (SOPs). In the modern era of viral pandemics, similar principles can also be applied toward prevention of viral transmission and protection of populations at risk. In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the probability of an individual getting infected is dependent on the viral load that an individual is exposed to in public spaces over a period of time. All prevention and control measures are based on preventing any such exposure to the virus, that can be achieved through limiting space for movement of the virus, using barriers and increasing distance to vulnerable surfaces, and limiting the duration of exposure. Apart from adhering to the laid-down provisions of a lock-down, preventive measures recommended for the general public include maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and using facemasks to break the chain of transmission. Appropriate triage and customization of treatment protocols can help curtail hospital visits and time-spent by cancer patients during pandemic times, thereby reducing their risk of exposure as well as allowing efficient utilization of resources. The outbreak of the contagious COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt healthcare systems globally with its unprecedented challenges. However, despite all the difficulties and hardships, it has also enabled new ways of learning and communication, which are likely to persist even in the post-COVID world.",0
1677,"Considering numerical simulations, this study shows that the so-called vertical social distancing health policy is ineffective to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. We present the SEIR-Net model, for a network of social group interactions, as a development of the classic mathematical model of SEIR epidemics (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic)-Removed). In the SEIR-Net model, we can simulate social contacts between groups divided by age groups and analyze different strategies of social distancing. In the vertical distancing policy, only older people are distanced, whereas in the horizontal distancing policy all age groups adhere to social distancing. These two scenarios are compared to a control scenario in which no intervention is made to distance people. The vertical distancing scenario is almost as bad as the control, both in terms of people infected and in the acceleration of cases. On the other hand, horizontal distancing, if applied with the same intensity in all age groups, significantly reduces the total infected people ""flattening the disease growth curve"". Our analysis considers the city of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, but similar conclusions apply to other cities as well. Code implementation of the model in R-language is provided in the supplementary material.",0
1678,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 epidemic is evolving rapidly. Healthcare workers are at increased risk for infection, and specific requirements for their protection are advisable to ensure the functioning of the basic healthcare system, including the availability of general practitioners (GPs). Understanding the transmission risk is particularly important for guiding evidence-based protective measures in the primary healthcare setting. METHODS: Healthcare worker contacts of an initially undiagnosed COVID-19 case, who were without personal protective equipment, in particular not wearing facemasks, were screened with nasopharyngeal swabs and polymerase chain reaction tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), irrespective of respiratory symptoms or fever seven days after initial contact. The details of exposure to the index case were obtained during routine contact investigation after unintentional pathogen exposure. RESULTS: Twenty-one healthcare workers reported contacts with the index case. Three healthcare workers reported respiratory symptoms (cough) or low-grade fever within 4 days. None of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of symptom onset. All 21 healthcare workers tested SARS-CoV-2 negative 7 days after initial index case contact, including the three healthcare workers with previous symptoms. Ten of the 21 healthcare workers reported a cumulative exposure time of &gt;15 minutes. Longer cumulative contact times were associated with more individual contacts, reduced contact time per contact and activities with physical patient contact. The closest relative of the index patient tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 2 days after the index case presented at the hospital emergency department. CONCLUSION: We found a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a primary care setting. These findings are compatible with previous reports of the highest transmission probability in household settings with prolonged close contacts. The current protective measures for healthcare workers, including strict adherence to basic standard hygiene and facemasks, offer considerable protection during short periods of contact with symptomatic COVID-19 cases by diminishing the risk of direct and indirect transmission.",0
1679,"COVID-19 has taken a terrible toll on the nursing home population. Yet, there are five times the number of seniors living in the community who are also extremely vulnerable because they suffer from respiratory illnesses. Using the 2018 wave of the Health and Retirement Study we analyze this group of roughly 7 million seniors living in the community and find that they have multiple risk factors that make them particularly exposed. We also show how current strategies for protecting this population may be exacerbating risks and suggest concrete steps for better protecting this group.",0
1680,"BACKGROUND: Homeless experts and some federal housing officials are sounding the alarm that the patchwork of government efforts to address the coronavirus outbreak risks leaving out one group of acutely vulnerable people: the homeless. In terms of isolation, it is too unclear what that looks like if you normally sleep on the streets. In this tough moment, when people should be turned away, not only it feels inhumane, but it is also a big public health risk, because where are they going to go? METHOD: The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation RESULTS: With more cities suspecting community transmission of the novel coronavirus, people who sleep in shelters or hunker down outside already have a lower life expectancy and often have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk if they develop COVID-19 (Global News, 2020). These people face lack of sleep, malnutrition, and ""extreme stress levels just to meet their daily needs"", all of which weakens the immune system. Along with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, they are ""incredibly vulnerable to this virus"". CONCLUSIONS: Health organizations are well aware of the risks involved in mental health. A large population of homeless people experience their pain and psychological distress intermittently. For low-income patients, the various borderline situations related to health/illness involve growing expectations regarding the basic needs. This is a serious concern when linked to the pandemic.",0
1681,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) that was first reported in Wuhan, China and provokes the COVID-19 disease has developed into a pandemic with hundreds of thousands of people infected. Many governments have enforced social isolation protocols on their citizens, which has led to the closure of many large public gatherings in order to limit the spread of the virus. These closures could reasonably be expected to affect blood collections, thereby presaging shortages of blood for transfusion. On the other hand, steps such as the postponement of elective surgeries and other non-urgent transfusions could mitigate against potential shortfalls in the blood supply.",0
1682,"In order to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19, governments have placed significant restrictions on liberty, including preventing all non-essential travel. These restrictions were justified on the basis the health system may be overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases and in order to prevent deaths. Governments are now considering how they may de-escalate these restrictions. This article argues that an appropriate approach may be to lift the general lockdown but implement selective isolation of the elderly. While this discriminates against the elderly, there is a morally relevant difference-the elderly are far more likely to require hospitalisation and die than the rest of the population. If the aim is to ensure the health system is not overwhelmed and to reduce the death rate, preventing the elderly from contracting the virus may be an effective means of achieving this. The alternative is to continue to keep everyone in lockdown. It is argued that this is levelling down equality and is unethical. It suggests that in order for the elderly to avoid contracting the virus, the whole population should have their liberty deprived, even though the same result could be achieved by only restricting the liberty of the elderly. Similar arguments may also be applied to all groups at increased risk of COVID-19, such as men and those with comorbidities, the obese and people from ethnic minorities or socially deprived groups. This utilitarian concern must be balanced against other considerations, such as equality and justice, and the benefits gained from discriminating in these ways must be proportionately greater than the negative consequences of doing so. Such selective discrimination will be most justified when the liberty restriction to a group promotes the well-being of that group (apart from its wider social benefits).",0
1683,"Purpose of review: The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in uncertainty for patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases for several reasons. They are concerned about their risk of developing COVID-19 as many are immune suppressed from their disease and/or treatment, whether they should stop their advanced therapies, if they will have a worse outcome if/when infected due to their underlying medication condition(s) and if they will have drug availability, especially with press (without much data) coverage suggesting hydroxychloroquine may be used in COVID-19 infection causing diversion of medication supply. This article discusses how the pandemic affects people with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Recent findings: Preliminarily, articles seem to suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases may not have more infections from SARS-CoV-2 and similar outcomes to age and gender matched patients, but fear of rheumatic medications increasing their risk, drug shortages, and work exposure all are concerns for patients. Recent findings: The long term effects of the pandemic in patients with rheumatic diseases will not be known until much later and likely include stressors flaring disease (fear, illness, job loss, social isolation), post-traumatic stress, flaring due to stopping medications, less physician visits with subsequent under-treatment, and increases in chronic concomitant fatigue, pain, fibromyalgia.",0
1684,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has forced governments to implement strict social mitigation strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality from acute infections. These strategies, however, carry a significant risk for mental health, which can lead to increased short-term and long-term mortality and is currently not included in modeling the impact of the pandemic. METHODS: We used years of life lost (YLL) as the main outcome measure, applied to Switzerland as an example. We focused on suicide, depression, alcohol use disorder, childhood trauma due to domestic violence, changes in marital status, and social isolation, as these are known to increase YLL in the context of imposed restriction in social contact and freedom of movement. We stipulated a minimum duration of mitigation of 3 months based on current public health plans. RESULTS: The study projects that the average person would suffer 0.205 YLL due to psychosocial consequence of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, this loss would be entirely borne by 2.1% of the population, who will suffer an average of 9.79 YLL. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here are likely to underestimate the true impact of the mitigation strategies on YLL. However, they highlight the need for public health models to expand their scope in order to provide better estimates of the risks and benefits of mitigation.",0
1686,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: The current 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is continuing to spread rapidly despite all efforts. Patients with rheumatic disease may have higher levels of anxiety due to their disease characteristics and medications. The web-based platforms are widely used sources for gaining medical information. YouTube presents a wide range of medical information, but there are concerns on its quality. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the quality of the YouTube videos about COVID-19 and rheumatic diseases link. METHOD: This is a descriptive study. A total of 360 videos listed by the YouTube search engine (www.youtube.com) in response to six search terms were evaluated. The Global Quality Scale (GQS) was performed to evaluate video quality. Three groups were formed according to GQS scores: high quality, moderate quality, and low quality. Video parameters were compared between these groups. RESULTS: After the exclusion criteria, 46 videos were reviewed. Of the videos, 41.4% (n = 19) were of high-quality group, 21.7% (n = 10) were moderate-quality group, and 36.9% (n = 17) were of low-quality group. Significant difference was detected between the quality groups in terms of views per day (p = 0.004). No significant difference was detected in comments per day (p = 0.139) and like ratio (p = 0.232). CONCLUSIONS: Besides high-quality videos, there were substantially low-quality videos that could cause misleading information to spread rapidly during the pandemic. Videos from trustworthy sources such as universities, academics, and physicians should be kept in the foreground.Key Points•Web-based platforms have become an important source of health-related information. One of the most important online sources is YouTube because it is easy accessible and free.•Of the videos evaluating the link between COVID-19 and rheumatic diseases, 41.4% (n = 19) were of high quality.•The main sources of high-quality videos were academics/universities and physicians.•The most frequently discussed topics in videos were the place of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 and whether to continue the use of existing rheumatological drugs.",0
1687,"OBJECTIVE: To identify salient beliefs about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine completion among young adult women who live in economically disadvantaged urban communities and to describe the integration of those beliefs into the development of a mobile health (mHealth) application to promote vaccine completion. DESIGN: Theory-based, community-informed, mHealth application development process. SETTING: Two federally supported family planning clinics in a large metropolitan area in the Northeastern region of the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five young adult women ages 18 to 26 years who lived in economically disadvantaged communities. METHODS: Participants completed a baseline survey and postclinic survey after they received the first doses of the HPV vaccine. Results informed the content of the application with additional input from a community advisory board and provider advisory board. RESULTS: One third of participants had prior sexually transmitted infections, but fewer than half used condoms during most recent intercourse. Most participants (n = 30 and 32 [86% and 91%]) had correct knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer, and most (n = 31, 89%) intended to get the next dose of the HPV vaccine. Twelve salient beliefs about HPV vaccine completion were identified and used to develop the NowIKnow mHealth application. The application includes information, motivational content, a discussion forum, and vaccine completion reminders. CONCLUSION: Theory-based research and user-centered design can be systematically integrated into the development of mHealth applications. With content tailored to the target population, use of this novel intervention has the potential to reduce cancer disparities by reaching disadvantaged young adult women.",0
1688,"Vaccination against the types of human papillomavirus (HPV) that cause about 70% of cervical cancers is approved for use in girls and women between 9 and 26 years of age and recommended routinely in 11-12-year-old girls. This article reports on the systematic theory-based formative research conducted to develop HPV vaccine messages for a campaign targeting racially diverse mothers of nonvaccinated 11-12-year-old girls in rural Southeastern United States. A consortium of 13 county health departments concerned about high rates of cervical cancer in their region relative to state and national averages initiated the campaign. The research examined behavioral determinants for vaccination decisions as well as mothers' reactions to message frames and emotional appeals. On the basis of focus groups and intercept interviews (n = 79), the authors demonstrated how preproduction message research and production message testing were used to develop messages that would motivate mothers of preteen girls. Core emotional truths that emerged were a mother's instinct to protect her daughter from harm and to embrace aspirations for her daughter's future. Mothers also reacted more positively to text about preventing cervical cancer than about preventing HPV, a sexually transmitted disease. Mothers preferred message concepts with photos of minorities and Caucasian mothers and daughters.",0
1689,"We describe a community-engaged research process used to develop multilevel interventions (caregivers, providers, system) to improve the uptake of human papillomavirus vaccine among adolescents by partnering with members from two underserved populations in Ohio. We began by conducting focus groups to better understand the knowledge and attitudes of caregivers and providers about the human papillomavirus vaccine and to develop teams of community members to assist with development of the interventions. The process continued with conducting writing sessions to determine the content and format of the interventions, and initial feedback was obtained during review sessions to refine the interventions prior to implementation. Using this approach, we were able to consider contextual factors that made the interventions more acceptable and relevant to members of the priority populations. Challenges included development and maintenance of a team of community members to participate in the entire intervention development process, rejection of ideas presented by academic researchers, the need to balance community members' suggestions with what was known from evidence-based research, and the time, cost, and effort associated with partnering with community members. The benefits, however, outweigh the challenges associated with using a community-engaged research process to develop interventions aimed at reducing cancer disparities among underserved populations.",0
1690,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is routinely recommended for U.S. adolescents ages 11 to 12 years, yet vaccine coverage remains low. Text message HPV immunization reminders to parents have been effective with increasing uptake, but text messages directly to adolescents in order to increase HPV vaccination uptake are unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the acceptability of text messages about HPV vaccination and message preferences among adolescents. Middle school students (n = 43) assisted in designing text messages to promote HPV vaccine among their peers. Through seven focus groups and two in-class surveys, we assessed students' knowledge of HPV vaccine, use of texting, and preferences for text messages and sources. The average age of participants was 13 years, and all were White (17 males, 26 females) in this rural setting. More than 70% used text messaging with a cell phone. The text message with the best composite score (M = 2.33, SD = 0.72) for likeability, trustworthiness, and motivation to seek more information was a gain frame emphasizing reduction in HPV infection if vaccinated against HPV. Text messages with lower scores emphasized threats of disease if not vaccinated. Participants (68%) preferred doctors as their information source. Text messaging to adolescents may be a strategy to improve HPV knowledge and vaccination.",0
1691,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, accounting for the large majority of cervical cancer and anogenital warts cases. Two HPV vaccines are currently licensed and recommended for women and girls. However, vaccination rates have been suboptimal, with evidence of disparities influencing both uptake and series completion among African American and Hispanic adolescents. There has been a dearth of theory-based, behavioral interventions targeted to prevent HPV infection and increase HPV vaccine uptake among urban adolescents. This article describes the development of two skills-based intervention curricula aimed to increase HPV prevention and vaccination among low-income urban adolescent females 9 to 18 years old. Guided by the theory of planned behavior, elicitation research was conducted to elucidate the social psychological factors that underlie HPV vaccination intentions (N = 141). The findings were subsequently used to identify theoretical mediators of behavioral change to drive the intervention. Culturally relevant strategies to promote HPV vaccination were translated into the curricula content. Both curricula were designed to motivate and empower participants to reduce risk of being infected with HPV. Targeting theoretical mediators of behavioral change, derived from the voices of the community, may prove to be successful in increasing HPV vaccination and preventing HPV.",0
1692,"CONTEXT: The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is a safe, effective cancer prevention method that is underutilized in the United States. Despite increased understanding of barriers to vaccination, rates remain low. Globally, developed and developing nations have achieved high rates of vaccination. OBJECTIVE: Identification of effective strategies is necessary to optimize uptake of the HPV vaccine. We systematically reviewed the literature for national and international interventions that have successfully increased HPV vaccine uptake. DATA SOURCES: We used a standardized protocol to search for articles published between January 1, 2006, and April 30, 2015, in 3 electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. STUDY SELECTION: We identified interventions designed to increase HPV vaccine uptake among adolescents and young adults aged 11 to 26 years. All study designs were acceptable. Only articles that included postintervention vaccination rates were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently reviewed each article for data extraction and quality assessment. Interventions were classified according to the Community Preventive Service Task Force guide. RESULTS: Results were reported according to the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework. Fifty-one articles met eligibility criteria: 2 informational interventions, 18 behavioral interventions, and 31 environmental interventions. Factors associated with HPV vaccine uptake were increased vaccine availability, decreased financial barriers, and interventions targeting both providers and patients. LIMITATIONS: Lack of consistent RE-AIM metric reporting, limiting our ability to assess intervention validity and quality. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based vaccination strategies that increased vaccine availability reached the greatest number of adolescents and were most successful in achieving high rates of vaccination.",0
1693,Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination occurs more frequently among females ages 11 to 18 than their male counterparts.

1694,"BACKGROUND: Nearly 80 million people in the United States have contracted the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), and it is currently the most common sexually transmitted disease. Each year approximately 14 million people are newly infected. OBJECTIVE(S): This study will address increasing the HPV vaccination rates by initiating a research agenda focusing on how best to utilize community pharmacies as Vaccines For Children (VFC) vaccination sites. Community pharmacies are highly accessible when compared to traditional vaccination sites due to extended evening and weekend business hours, no copays for visits, and no appointment required to speak with a pharmacist. METHODS: We will conduct a Developmental Formative Evaluation using semi-structured interviews with key informants (pharmacists, pharmacy managers, technicians) from 5 Harps pharmacies to identify barriers and facilitators to community pharmacies' provision of HPV vaccine through a mixed methods design with pharmacy staff members and local physicians. We will follow that by selecting a pharmacist-physician collaborative model and identify implementation strategies through an Evidence Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) process with key stakeholders. This will be followed by piloting the selected pharmacist-physician collaborative model and implementation strategies in two Harps pharmacies (1 rural, 1 urban) on relevant implementation outcomes. PROJECT IMPACT: This study will examine the current model of HPV vaccinations and how to improve HPV vaccination rates among adolescents by utilizing community pharmacy services.",0

The study was conducted in two clinics in eastern North Carolina from March 2014-March 2016. Participants included English-speaking and/or Spanish-speaking, uninsured or Medicaid-insured parents and their children (ages 9-17). Intervention participants received text/email appointment reminders and education messages and controls received standard-of-care. The final sample included 257 parent-child dyads. Most identified as Black (60%) or Hispanic (28%). Completion rates for intervention and control groups were similar for HPV dose 2 (65% vs. 65%) and HPV dose 3 (35% vs. 30%), respectively. Although knowledge change was higher for the intervention group, this difference was not statistically significant. Those who reported provider vaccine recommendation were 1.8 times more likely to complete the series. Electronic reminders to promote vaccine completion were not effective in this population. More research is needed.",0
1696,"PURPOSE: To assess the effect of phone or text message reminders to parents of adolescents on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series completion in Rochester, NY. METHODS: We performed parallel randomized controlled trials of phone and text reminders for HPV vaccine for parents of 11- to 17-year olds in three urban primary care clinics. The main outcome measures were time to receipt of the third dose of HPV vaccine and HPV vaccination rates. RESULTS: We enrolled 178 phone intervention (180 control) and 191 text intervention (200 control) participants. In multivariate survival analysis controlling for gender, age, practice, insurance, race, and ethnicity, the time from enrollment to receipt of the third HPV dose for those receiving a phone reminder compared with controls was not significant overall (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.30, p = .12) but was for those enrolling at dose 1 (HR = 1.91, p = .007). There was a significant difference in those receiving a text reminder compared with controls (HR = 2.34, p < .0001; an average of 71 days earlier). At the end of the study, 48% of phone intervention versus 40% of phone control (p = .34), and 49% of text intervention versus 30% of text control (p = .001) adolescents had received 3 HPV vaccine doses. CONCLUSIONS: In this urban population of parents of adolescents, text message reminders for HPV vaccine completion for those who had already started the series were effective, whereas phone message reminders were only effective for those enrolled at dose 1.",0
1697,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer places a substantial economic burden on our healthcare system. The three-dose human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series is a cost-effective intervention to prevent HPV infection and resultant cervical cancer. Despite its efficacy, completion rates are low in young women aged 18 through 26 years. 1-2-3 Pap is a video intervention tested and proven to increase HPV vaccination completion rates. PURPOSE: To provide the full scope of available evidence for 1-2-3 Pap, this study adds economic evidence to the intervention's efficacy. This study tested the economies of scale hypothesis that the cost of 1-2-3 Pap intervention per number of completed HPV vaccine series would decrease when offered to more women in the target population. METHODS: Using cost and efficacy data from the Rural Cancer Prevention Center, a cost analysis was done through a hypothetical adaptation scenario in rural Kentucky. RESULTS: Assuming the same success rate as in the efficacy study, the 1-2-3 Pap adaptation scenario would cover 1000 additional women aged 18 through 26 years (344 in efficacy study; 1346 in adaptation scenario), and almost three times as many completed series (130 in efficacy study; 412 in adaptation scenario) as in the original 1-2-3 Pap efficacy study. IMPLICATIONS: Determination of the costs of implementing 1-2-3 Pap is vital for program expansion. This study provides practitioners and decision makers with objective measures for scalability.",0
1698,"The aim of this study was to examine the association between school nurses' demographic characteristics and their knowledge, attitudes, perception of role as opinion leader and professional practice regarding the HPV vaccine. Participants were randomly selected and completed an online survey. ANOVA tested group differences in geographic population, grade level being served, and geographic region. School nurses working in metropolitan areas had positive attitudes and stronger perceptions of being an opinion leader than in rural areas. School nurses serving high schools exhibited stronger perceptions than nurses serving elementary level. These results suggest interventions should focus on strengthening HPV vaccine attitudes and perceptions of their role as opinion leaders for rural school nurses, and those serving K-8th grade levels.",0
1699,"OBJECTIVES: Adolescent immunizations such as human papillomavirus vaccine have been implemented through school based immunization programs (SBIPs) in Australia. We assessed community attitudes toward immunization of adolescents though SBIPs. METHODS: A cross-sectional population survey of rural and metropolitan households in South Australia in 2011. Univariate and multiple regression analyses identified predictors of support for a SBIP. RESULTS: Participation rate was 57.3% with 1926 adults interviewed. Overall, 75.9% regarded school as the best place to offer adolescent immunizations, with 16.4% preferring the family physician. Parents of high school students were most supportive (88.4%) of a SBIP with 87.9% of their adolescents reported as having participated in the program. Adults 18-34 years (79.4%) were more likely to support a SBIP compared to older adults (68.7% of >55 years) [adjusted OR=2.39, p=0.002] and men were more supportive (80.3%) than women (71.7%) [adjusted OR=1.54, p=0.003]. Reasons for participation in the SBIP included convenience (39.9%), public funding for the service (32.4%), and confidence in immunization recommendations (21.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Public support for the SBIP was very high particularly amongst parents whose adolescent/s had participated in the program.",0
1700,"INTRODUCTION: Although Indian Health Service, tribally-operated, and urban Indian (I/T/U) healthcare facilities have higher human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series initiation and completion rates among adolescent patients aged 13-17 years than the general U.S. population, challenges remain. I/T/U facilities have lower coverage for HPV vaccine first dose compared with coverage for other adolescent vaccines, and HPV vaccine series completion rates are lower than initiation rates. Researchers aimed to assist I/T/U facilities in identifying interventions to increase HPV vaccination series initiation and completion rates. STUDY DESIGN: Best practice and intervention I/T/U healthcare facilities were identified based on baseline adolescent HPV vaccine coverage data. Healthcare professionals were interviewed about barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination. Researchers used responses and evidence-based practices to identify and assist facilities in implementing interventions to increase adolescent HPV vaccine series initiation and completion. Coverage and interview data were collected from June 2013 to June 2015; data were analyzed in 2015. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: I/T/U healthcare facilities located within five Indian Health Service regions. INTERVENTION: Interventions included analyzing and providing feedback on facility vaccine coverage data, educating providers about HPV vaccine, expanding access to HPV vaccine, and establishing or expanding reminder recall and education efforts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Impact of evidence-based strategies and best practices to support HPV vaccination. RESULTS: Mean baseline first dose coverage with HPV vaccine at best practice facilities was 78% compared with 46% at intervention facilities. Mean third dose coverage was 48% at best practice facilities versus 19% at intervention facilities. Intervention facilities implemented multiple low-cost, evidence-based strategies and best practices to increase vaccine coverage. At baseline, most facilities used electronic provider reminders, had standing orders in place for administering HPV vaccine, and administered tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis and HPV vaccines during the same visit. At intervention sites, mean coverage for HPV initiation and completion increased by 24% and 22%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A tailored multifaceted approach addressing vaccine delivery processes and patient and provider education may increase HPV vaccine coverage.",0
1701,"BACKGROUND: Countries with high human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates have achieved this success largely through school-based vaccination. Using school-based health centers (SBHCs) in the United States, where HPV vaccine remains underutilized, could improve uptake. In this mixed-methods study, we examined acceptability, facilitators, and barriers of HPV vaccination visits at SBHCs from the perspectives of adolescents and parents. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews and structured surveys with adolescents and parents recruited from an urban, hospital-based clinic. Interviews with parents (N = 20) and adolescents (N = 20) were audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis using an iterative thematic approach. Quantitative measures for a survey administered to parents (N = 131) were derived from the qualitative findings. Survey results were analyzed by chi-square tests. RESULTS: Many participants expressed favorable opinions of HPV vaccination at SBHCs in qualitative interviews. Facilitators included convenience, ease of scheduling, and not missing work or school. However, barriers were noted including concerns about obtaining care outside the medical home, fragmentation of medical records, and negative perceptions about SBHCs. Quantitative findings revealed that a higher proportion of parents with experience using SBHCs were willing to use a middle school (59.5%) or high school (80.5%) SBHC for HPV vaccinations compared with those who had not used SBHCs (p < .05 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination visits at SBHCs were acceptable, and SBHC users expressed more favorable attitudes. Barriers to HPV vaccination at SBHCs can be addressed through more education about SBHCs' role, and improvement of systems to coordinate care.",0
1702,"BACKGROUND: There is a disparity in HPV vaccination rates in particular among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and until very recently there has been a dearth of research examining factors related to HPV vaccination for YMSM. The purpose of this study was to elicit YMSM's beliefs about HPV and the HPV vaccine as well as describe perceived barriers and facilitators of vaccine initiation and completion. METHODS: A qualitative, descriptive study that utilized a focus group design was conducted among an urban and racially diverse sample of YMSM. Questionnaire data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and focus group data were analyzed using content analysis. FINDINGS: 34 YMSM with a mean age of 20.8years participated. The sample was diverse, with the largest proportion of youth identifying as Black (35.4%). Over 90% reported having an annual exam each year, 61.8% reported obtaining a flu vaccine during the past year, and 58.8% reported initiating the HPV vaccine 3-dose series. Themes identified included low HPV knowledge and awareness, positive vaccine beliefs, perceived stigmas, and HPV vaccine facilitators. Participants identified 3 ways health providers/ researchers could facilitate vaccination: creative use of mobile technology, bundling vaccination with other health services, and increasing HPV and HPV vaccine awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to some clear avenues to pursue in research and practice to improve HPV vaccination rates among YMSM, including increased use of mobile health strategies, making HPV vaccination a co-occurring part of other health-related services (e.g., HIV testing), and providing information on the relevance of HPV and HPV vaccination to YMSM.",0
1703,": media-1vid110.1542/5849572217001PEDS-VA_2018-1457Video Abstract BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection can lead to serious health issues and remains the most common sexually transmitted infection. Despite availability of effective vaccines, HPV vaccination rates are suboptimal. METHODS: In a cluster randomized trial, an intervention used to target parents of adolescents (11-17 years) eligible for a dose of HPV vaccine, was tested in pediatric clinics part of an urban health system. Parents watched a digital video outlining the risks and benefits of vaccine using a tablet in the examination room. The primary outcome was change in HPV vaccine status 2 weeks after the clinic visit. An intention-to-treat analysis for the primary outcome used generalized estimating equations to accommodate the potential cluster effect of clinics. RESULTS: A total of 1596 eligible adolescents were observed during the 7-month trial. One-third of adolescents visited an intervention clinic. Adolescents who attended an intervention clinic were more likely to be younger (11-12 years) than those who attended a control clinic (72.4% vs 49.8%; P < .001). No differences in race or sex were observed. The proportion of adolescents with an observed change in vaccine status was higher for those attending an intervention clinic (64.8%) versus control clinic (50.1%; odds ratio, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-2.25; P < .001). Adolescents whose parents watched the video had a 3-times greater odds of receiving a dose of the HPV vaccine (78.0%; odds ratio, 3.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-6.42; P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: Educational interventions delivered within a clinical setting hold promise to improve vaccination behaviors.",0
1704,"OBJECTIVES: This paper identifies differences in the uptake rate of Gardasil and contrasts Gardasil uptake rate with the history of Hepatitis B vaccination. METHODS: A targeted review of peer-reviewed journals and industry commentary was conducted. New trends were calculated and figures created based on secondary data. RESULTS: The distribution of HPV vaccine does not conform to the geographic incidence rate of cervical cancer. Contrary to contemporary belief, school immunization mandates for Hepatitis B vaccines were not the impetus for their acceptance. Familial beliefs about HPV vaccines appear to be the most significant challenge to Gardasil uptake rate. CONCLUSIONS: Gardasil is at a critical juncture for increased uptake. Evidence-based educational interventions are needed.",0
1705,"PURPOSE: To contrast rates of initial HPV vaccine uptake, offered at no cost, between a rural clinic, a rural community college, and an urban college clinic and to identify rural versus urban differences in uptake of free booster doses. METHODS: Young rural women attending rural clinics (n = 246), young women attending a rural community college (n = 251) and young women attending an urban university health clinic (n = 209) were recruited in Kentucky. After completing a brief questionnaire, women received a free voucher for HPV vaccination. Whether women redeemed the voucher for the initial dose of vaccine served as the study outcome variable. FINDINGS: In controlled analyses, the contrast in initial uptake between urban clinic women (reference category) and rural college women was significant (P < .0001). However, the contrast in initial uptake between urban clinic women (reference category) and rural clinic women was not significant (P = .42). The model predicting uptake of subsequent doses among those with initial uptake (n = 235) also indicated significant differences as a function of recruitment location, with rural clinic women being about 7 times more likely than urban clinic women (P < .0001) to not return for at least 1 follow-up dose. The contrast between urban clinic women and rural college women was also significant (P = .014). CONCLUSION: Initial uptake of free HPV vaccination among young rural college women may be problematic. Moreover, uptake of subsequent free doses among rural women may be problematic regardless of whether contact is made in a clinic or through college recruitment.",0
1706,"PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to measure the impact of a behavioral economic intervention on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine initiation and series completion rates for adolescents and to measure the impact of the intervention on the receipt of a nonincentivized influenza vaccine. METHODS: We conducted a quasi-randomized trial to compare the impact of an escalating delayed cash incentive (intervention), compared with usual care (control), on HPV vaccination initiation and series completion rates among adolescents (11-17 years) at an urban medical center. We measured HPV vaccine initiation and completion rates during the 12 months after enrollment and subsequent influenza vaccination rates for 24 months after enrollment. RESULTS: A total of 85 participants were actively enrolled in the intervention arm and 103 were passively enrolled in the control arm. Participants were predominantly publically insured African-American and Hispanic adolescents. The majority (75%) of the intervention group received one or more doses of the HPV vaccine, with 36% completing the three-dose series, compared with 47% of the control group receiving one or more doses and only 13% completing the series. The odds of HPV p-value vaccine initiation (odds ratio 4.19 [95% confidence interval 1.84-10.10], p < .01) and HPV vaccine series completion (OR 4.16 [95% confidence interval 1.64-11.28], p < .01) were greater among the intervention group compared with the control group. There was no difference in influenza vaccination rates between the intervention group and the control group during the 2013-2014 season (p = .138) and during the 2014-2015 influenza season (p value .683). CONCLUSIONS: An incentive-based approach to HPV vaccination was effective in increasing vaccine initiation and series dose completion.",0
1707,"OBJECTIVES: To test the effectiveness of a comprehensive team-based intervention to improve human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination completion rates and reduce missed opportunities to vaccinate in rural Oregon. DESIGN: Stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial. PARTICIPANTS: Forty family physicians and pediatricians who are members of the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network. INTERVENTION: Tailored to individual practice needs, components will include (1) practice facilitation with clinicians, nurses, front office staff, and others who have patient contact to redesign patient care and communication strategies to optimize HPV vaccine series completion; (2) workflow mapping adapted to practice context to support HPV vaccine delivery; (3) a practice improvement model designed to firmly establish reminder and recall systems and then standing orders; (4) education for patients and parents that underscores HPV vaccination is safe, effective, and an important approach for reducing cancer risk; and (5) partnering with community organizations to plan and implement a social marketing campaign on HPV vaccination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Initiation and completion of the HPV vaccine series as well as reduction in rates of missed opportunities to vaccinate derived from Oregon Immunization Program data.

1708,"INTRODUCTION: Half of all new human papillomavirus (HPV) infections occur in adolescents and young adults, and this population has poor HPV vaccination rates. Rural areas of the U.S. have high rates of HPV-related diseases and low vaccination rates as well. The purpose of this study was to determine the perceived barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination among adolescents and their caregivers in rural south Alabama. METHODS: Vaccinated and non-vaccinated adolescents ages 11-18 years old and primary caregivers were recruited from three rural counties in south Alabama. Participants completed individual interviews to discuss perceived barriers to vaccination and factors influencing their decision to vaccinate. Discussion groups were held to determine potential solutions to barriers elucidated from the interviews. Interview and discussion group transcripts were analyzed, and themes were identified. RESULTS: Approximately 62.5% of adolescents had not initiated the HPV vaccine series. Of those adolescents who started the vaccine series (n = 9, 37.5%), about half completed it (n = 5). Few participants in this study reported speaking with their health care provider (HCP) about the vaccine in the past year. Lack of information about the vaccine, its side effects, and no HCP recommendation were common barriers cited by non-vaccinators. Facilitators to vaccination included cancer prevention, discussion with HCP, and peer testimonials. Potential solutions to barriers were also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Proposed strategies to increase HPV vaccination were similar between vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups. Education about HPV and the HPV vaccine is needed throughout these rural south Alabama communities to ensure informed decisions are made about vaccination and to increase vaccination rates.",0
1709,"Efforts to understand low human papillomavirus vaccine coverage led us to explore quality improvement (QI) decision-making programs and processes to increase vaccine uptake. These QI programs often include interventions recommended by the AFIX (Assessment Feedback Incentives eXchange) Program that supports Vaccines for Children (VFC) clinics. However, little is known about decision-making around intervention selection or extent of implementation. In collaboration with the state public health department in the rural Midwestern, investigators developed a survey to explore vaccine-related QI in VFC clinics. The survey was distributed via email to all VFC clinics (n = 605); results presented are from the primary care clinics (n = 115). Respondents (VFC liaisons) reported decisions about vaccine QI were made by multiple actors within their own clinics (45.1%), by a clinic manager in charge of multiple clinics (33.0%) and/or at a centralized administrative office (35.2%). Additionally, the majority of respondents considered external actors, like insurance companies (52.7%) or Medicaid/Medicare (50.5%), important to the decision-making process. Most commonly implemented interventions focused on provider knowledge and patient education. Least commonly implemented interventions required systematic changes, such as reminder/recall and follow-up after missed appointments. This preliminary research indicates there are multiple points of decision-making within clinics and health care systems, and therefore change agents at all points need to be involved. The most commonly implemented interventions focus on providers and patients, with an emphasis on education. Interventions requiring system-level changes and use of electronic health records are less common and more attention should be directed towards such interventions.",0
1710,"OBJECTIVE: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, and over 85% of cervical cancers occur in developing countries such as China. Lack of resources for nationwide cervical cancer screening in China makes vaccination against oncogenic strains of HPV particularly important. Knowledge of age at sexual debut and sexual behavior is essential prior to implementation of a national vaccination program. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cross-sectional epidemiologic survey was conducted across 21 urban and rural sites in China to assess age at sexual debut and sexual behavior. 98.6% of the 11,852 recruited women aged 15-59 years were included in the analysis. Data were collected using a short, nurse-administered questionnaire and analyzed using standard descriptive statistics and survival analysis. RESULTS: In urban areas, more than ten percent of the 15-19 year old age group were already sexually active at the time of interview; this number increased to nearly 44% in the 20-24 year old age group. Chinese young women with an occupation were more likely to be sexually active compared to female students of the same age, irrespective of area of residence. The crude median sexual debut age for the youngest age group was 17 years, earlier than the sexual debut age reported by older cohorts. Younger age cohorts had an earlier menarche age than older cohorts and were more likely to have more sexual partners than older women, and more likely to have partners with more than one female partner. CONCLUSION: There is a trend towards earlier sexual debut and riskier sexual behaviors in younger age groups of Chinese women. These findings suggest that HPV vaccination of women between the ages of 13 and 15 years, before the completion of national compulsory education, is likely to contribute to the prevention of HPV infection and cervical cancer in China.",0
1711,"OBJECTIVES: To assess knowledge of HPV and attitudes towards HPV vaccination among the general female population, government officials, and healthcare providers in China to assist the development of an effective national HPV vaccination program. METHODS: A cross-sectional epidemiologic survey was conducted across 21 urban and rural sites in China using a short questionnaire. 763 government officials, 760 healthcare providers, and 11,681 women aged 15-59 years were included in the final analysis. Data were analyzed using standard descriptive statistics and logistic regression. RESULTS: Knowledge of HPV among the general female population was low; only 24% had heard of HPV. Less than 20% of healthcare providers recognized sexually naive women as the most appropriate population for HPV vaccination. There was high acceptance of the HPV vaccine for all categories of respondents. Only 6% of women were willing to pay more than US $300 for the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive education is necessary to increase knowledge of HPV and its vaccine. Further proof of vaccine safety and efficacy and government subsidies combined with increased awareness could facilitate development and implementation of HPV vaccination in China.",0
1712,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 are the two most common HPV oncogenic types that can be prevented by vaccination. This study aimed at assessing the cost-effectiveness of 3 doses of the bivalent HPV vaccine in rural and urban settings in China. METHODS: A Markov model was adapted to reflect the lifetime of a modelled 100,000 12-year-old girls cohort in rural and urban settings in China. Input parameters were obtained from published literature, official reports and a two-round expert review panel. Clinical and economic outcomes of vaccination at age 12 with screening was compared to screening only. In the base case analysis, a 3 % discount rate, the vaccine cost of 247 CNY (US$ 39, PAHO vaccine cost in 2013), two rounds of screening in a life time and 70 % coverage for both screening and vaccination were used. One-way, two-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. We used different thresholds of cost-effectiveness to reflect the diversity of economic development in China. RESULTS: Vaccination in addition to screening could prevent 60 % more cervical cancer cases and deaths than screening only. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio varied largely when changing cost of vaccination and discount in one way analysis. Vaccination was very cost-effective when the vaccine cost ranged 87-630 CNY (US$ 13.8-100) in rural and 87-750 CNY (US$ 13.8-119) in urban; and remained cost-effective when the vaccine cost ranged 630-1,700 CNY (US$ 100-270) in rural and 750-1,900 CNY (US$ 119-302) in urban in two way analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that model results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: In both rural and urban, the vaccination cost and discounting are important factors determining the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination; policy makers in China should take these into account when making a decision on the introduction of HPV vaccine. In areas with a high burden of cervical cancer and limited screening activities, HPV vaccination should be prioritized. However, the vaccine cost needs to be reduced in order to make it very cost-effective and affordable as well, in particular in poverty areas with high disease burden.",0
1713,"OBJECTIVES: Data on the seroprevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in China are limited. The objective of this study was to characterise the serological profiles of HPV infection in a rural Chinese population and help establish effective vaccine policy. METHODS: Serum antibodies against the major capsid protein L1 of 10 HPV types (HPV-3, 6, 11, 16, 18, 45, 52, 57, 58 and 75) were evaluated with Luminex-based multiplex serology in a population-based study of 5548 adults (including 1587 couples) aged 25-65 years enrolled from rural Anyang, China, in 2007-2009. RESULTS: The seroprevalence for any HPV type and any of the types HPV-6/11/16/18 was 64.8% and 34.4%, respectively. 30.3% of adults were seropositive for any mucosal high-risk (HR) HPV, and HPV-58 (10.6%), HPV-16 (9.7%) and HPV-18 (9.3%) were the three most common types. 24.8% of seropositive individuals were positive for multiple mucosal HR-HPV serotypes. Seroprevalence for most HPV types was similar among men and women. While mucosal low-risk HPV seropositivity was found to significantly decrease with age, the prevalence of antibodies to mucosal HR antigens showed a general trend of increase with age. The lifetime number of sex partners was independently associated with mucosal HR-HPV seropositivity. Positive correlation of spousal seropositivity was observed for mucosal HPV but not for cutaneous HPV. CONCLUSIONS: HPV infection was common in both men and women in rural China. HPV seroprevalence differed significantly with age, sexual behaviour and spousal infection status. These findings will be useful for evaluating and establishing HPV vaccination programmes.",0
1714,"PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease and a known cause of many cancers. Previous research explored HPV-associated (HPVa) cancer differences by gender or race, but rural-urban differences in rates and trends have received little attention. This study examined rural-urban differences in rates and temporal trends for individual HPVa cancers. METHODS: The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries public use data set, representing approximately 93% of the US population, was used to calculate age-adjusted incidence rates and rate ratios (RR; 2009-2013) and overall and annual percentage changes (APC; 1995-2013) for HPVa cancers, including cervical carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, rectum, and oropharynx. Rural-Urban Continuum Codes were dichotomized into urban (levels 1-3) and rural (4-9). RRs and APC analyses were stratified by cancer site, rurality, gender, and race/ethnicity. FINDINGS: Combined HPVa cancers were elevated in rural populations compared to urban (RR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.06-1.09). Rural females had significantly higher rates of cervical, vaginal, vulvar, oropharyngeal, and anal cancer compared to their urban peers, while rural males had higher rates of penile cancer. Many disparities remained after racial/ethnic stratification (eg, white and black rural females were at increased risk of cervical carcinoma). Regarding trends, rural females and males experienced greater rate increases, or smaller rate decreases, overall and by APC, for nearly every cancer site. CONCLUSIONS: Rural populations experience consistent disparities in HPVa cancers. Further research should examine contributing behavioral and epidemiological risk factors and interventions to improve HPV vaccination.",0
1715,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine knowledge, attitudes and believes about cervical cancer and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination with related factors in Turkish university students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive and cross sectional study was conducted between June-July 2013 in Hitit University located in Corum, a rural area to the East of Ankara. The population consisted of 550 university students who were training in first and last year from Faculties of Economics, Theology and Health. We reached 463 volunteer students without selection. The study of data was collected with a 44 item questionaire covering socio-demographic features, knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about cervical cancer, HPV and vaccination. Also for this study ethic committee report was taken from Bozok University. Data were evaluated with the SPSS 17.0 programme using the Ki kare test with P<0.05 accepted as statistically significant. RESULTS: It was seen that there was a statistically significant variation between classrooms and departments of students with knowledge about cervical cancer and human papilloma virus and vaccine (p<0.001; p<0.01; p<0.05). Also we found low attitudes to thinking about taking HPV vaccination of girls and their children in the future. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the study findings; it was concluded that knowledge levels, beliefs and attitudes of the university students about cervical cancer, HPV infection and HPV vaccination were low.",0
1716,"BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common among adolescents, and multiple STIs over one's lifetime can increase health risks. Few studies have assessed lifetime STI prevalence. This study evaluates minority, underserved adolescents' self-reported lifetime STI history and objective STI rates. METHODS: Lifetime STI rates of female patients at an urban adolescent health center were obtained from self-administered questionnaires. Additionally, STI test results were retrieved from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Patients reported a high lifetime prevalence of STIs. By comparing self-report and objective data, underreporting was identified for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and herpes. CONCLUSIONS: STI rates in at-risk adolescent females are higher than in the general population and remain elevated over time. Lifetime STI reports could expand our understanding of sexual health and should be further studied. Underreporting, which may increase health risks and hinder health care delivery, requires further investigation. Improvements in STI screening and prevention targeting at-risk populations are warranted.",0
1717,"BACKGROUND: Willingness to be vaccinated with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among junior middle school students in China is not well understood. We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine and explore the factors associated with willingness to be vaccinated. METHODS: First-year students from two junior middle schools in Jinan, China were selected by cluster sampling on December 28, 2015, December 26, 2016, and January 11, 2017, and a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to explore the factors associated with willingness to be vaccinated with the HPV vaccine. RESULTS: A total of 1021 junior middle school students participated in this survey. Only 15.5% of them had heard of HPV and 18.9% of them had heard of the HPV vaccine. Students who were willing to take the HPV vaccine in the future accounted for 66.9%. Factors associated with the HPV vaccination were: urban junior middle school students (AOR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.09-2.09), female students (AOR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.36-2.66), students surveyed in 2015 (AOR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.26-2.28), regarding menstruation/spermatorrhoea as a normal physiological phenomenon (AOR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.14-2.36), believing vaccination is an important way to prevent diseases (AOR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.01-1.83), believing that the first vaccination should be in infancy (AOR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.04-1.92), believing that cervical cancer is a concern for themselves (AOR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.28-2.97), and having heard of HPV (AOR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.13-2.98). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine among junior students was low, however willingness to be vaccinated was high. Education focusing on HPV-related knowledge in addition to sex education is needed to promote the coverage of the HPV vaccine.",0
1718,"OBJECTIVE: This study's purpose was to assess knowledge and concerns related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among underserved Latina women and Latina mothers of female adolescents and to explore differences between those in the vaccinated and those in the unvaccinated groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional written surveys of 206 Latina women at an urban health center in central New Jersey. Participants included vaccine-eligible women and mothers of vaccine-eligible adolescents. We calculated descriptive statistics, Fisher exact tests, and corresponding risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Of those who had heard of HPV (71%), 80% knew that HPV is a sexually transmitted infection. Fewer understood the causative link between HPV and cervical cancer (58%) and genital warts (45%). Vaccine safety was the most frequently cited concern. Unvaccinated women and mothers of unvaccinated daughters were more worried that the vaccine could promote risky sexual behavior (RR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.1) and more likely to believe that they or their daughters were not at risk for HPV infection (RR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1-1.4). CONCLUSIONS: To maximize HPV vaccination rates among underserved Latinas, concerns about vaccine safety, potential effects on sexual behavior, and self-perceptions of risk for HPV infection must be addressed.",0
1719,"Background. Cervical cancer prevention in developing countries is suboptimal compared with the developed world where there are fewer deaths and improved survival rates. This study describes the perception and preventive practices on cervical cancer by residents of an urban neighborhood of Lagos, Nigeria. Methods. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 317 consecutively recruited consenting participants at a medical outreach using a pretested, interviewer-administered, semistructured questionnaire. Data analysis was done using statistical package for social sciences version 19. Tests of significance were performed using 95% confidence interval with level of significance set at P < 0.05. Results. The majority of respondents were within 30-49 years of age (46.7%) and female (62.1%) and 70.3% had secondary level education and above. About 37.2% of respondents had heard about cervical cancer with 84.5% of the participants willing to attend a cervical cancer health education program. Among the female respondents, 4.1% had received the HPV vaccine, while 5.1% had undergone a Pap test. Awareness about cervical cancer was significantly higher with increasing age in the total population (P < 0.05). Conclusion. There is a need to improve awareness of at-risk groups and the menfolk about cervical cancer based on the immense benefit of male involvement in reproductive health matters.",0
1720,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of cervical cancer in developing countries is high and even higher among women in rural areas in these countries. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess the knowledge and attitudes towards human papillomavirus (HPV), HPV vaccination, and cervical cancer among young women in rural settings in a Southeast Asia country. METHODS: A convenience sample of ethnically diverse young rural women in Malaysia was surveyed. Participants were interviewed using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the participants (N = 449), knowledge of HPV, HPV vaccination, cervical screening, and cervical cancer risk factors was extremely poor. The mean total knowledge score (14 items) was 2.37 (SD ± 1.97). Although many had never heard of the newly released HPV vaccine, two-thirds professed an intention to receive the HPV vaccine. Intention to receive the vaccine was significantly associated with knowledge of cervical screening and cervical cancer risk factors (OR 1.17; 95% CI 1.03-1.33; P = 0.013). Reasons for vaccine refusal were doubts about safety and efficacy of the new vaccine (27.4%), perceived embarrassment at receiving an STI vaccine (20.7%), and perception of not being at risk of HPV infection (20.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Providing HPV education to the rural residents is a high priority.",0
1721,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with the willingness of boys to accept the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional survey among Secondary One male students in Malaysia. RESULTS: Among 2823 respondents, knowledge about HPV infection and the HPV vaccine was extremely poor. The mean total knowledge score was only 3.17 (SD ± 2.14), out of a possible score of 10. The majority of respondents were unaware that vaccinating boys can help protect girls against HPV infection (81.6%), and HPV is a sexually transmitted infection (70.1%). Many had the misconception that only females get HPV (78.9%). In multivariable analysis, the factors associated with the intention to receive the HPV vaccination were: agreeing boys need to be vaccinated against HPV infection (odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-2.68), perceiving their parents might allow them to get the HPV vaccine (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.18-2.34), perceived susceptibility to HPV infection (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.06-2.52), and attending a rural school (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.14-1.95). CONCLUSIONS: Public health educational programs that are focused and tailored on parents consenting to HPV vaccination for boys at a young age can be useful in improving HPV vaccination rates among boys. There is also a pressing need to educate boys about the benefits of HPV vaccination in males and about HPV disease susceptibility to facilitate adoption of the HPV vaccine by young adults in the future.",0
1722,"PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to better characterize the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in female adolescents. METHODS: Female adolescents were enrolled in a longitudinal study. Self-vaginal samples were obtained every 3 months and tested for HPV. No participants received HPV vaccination. The findings for 40 female adolescents with the longest follow-up are reported in this study. RESULTS: Average age at the time of enrollment was 15.2 years (range: 14-17; SD: .97). Mean duration of follow-up was 6.7 years (range: 4.4-9.2; SD: 1.2). In all, 32 participants (80%) reported being involved in sexual activity before their enrollment in the study; all reported being involved in sexual activity before enrollment; all reported being involved in sexual activity during follow-up. Baseline and cumulative prevalence of HPV among participants was 55% and 100%, respectively. During the study, each participant tested positive for a mean of 14 HPV types. Cumulatively, HPV 16 was detected in 29 of 40 participants (72.5%). Mean duration of high- and low-risk infections was 655.9 (median: 433) and 524.1 days (median: 334), respectively. CONCLUSION: With prolonged follow-up, HPV infections with multiple types were found in all participants. Most had infection with HPV-16 or HPV-18, the oncogenic types represented in current vaccines, as well as infection with other oncogenic types. These data reinforce the importance of vaccine and non-vaccine strategies for prevention of HPV infections.",0
1723,"BACKGROUND: We compared vaccine coverage achieved by 2 different delivery strategies for the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in Tanzanian schoolgirls. METHODS: In a cluster-randomized trial of HPV vaccination conducted in Tanzania, 134 primary schools were randomly assigned to class-based (girls enrolled in primary school grade [class] 6) or age-based (girls born in 1998; 67 schools per arm) vaccine delivery. The primary outcome was coverage by dose. RESULTS: There were 3352 and 2180 eligible girls in schools randomized to class-based and age-based delivery, respectively. HPV vaccine coverage was 84.7% for dose 1, 81.4% for dose 2, and 76.1% for dose 3. For each dose, coverage was higher in class-based schools than in age-based schools (dose 1: 86.4% vs 82.0% [P = .30]; dose 2: 83.8% vs 77.8% [P = .05]; and dose 3: 78.7% vs 72.1% [P = .04]). Vaccine-related adverse events were rare. Reasons for not vaccinating included absenteeism (6.3%) and parent refusal (6.7%). School absenteeism rates prior to vaccination ranged from 8.1% to 23.5%. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccine can be delivered with high coverage in schools in sub-Saharan Africa. Compared with age-based vaccination, class-based vaccination located more eligible pupils and achieved higher coverage. HPV vaccination did not increase absenteeism rates in selected schools. Innovative strategies will be needed to reach out-of-school girls. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01173900.",0
1724,"PURPOSE: Rural and highly religious Intermountain West states demonstrate low levels of HPV vaccination uptake. The Intermountain West HPV Vaccination Coalition (IWHVC) was formed to improve HPV vaccination by enhancing collaborations between cancer centers, health departments, health clinics, religious groups, and community organizations. Coalition members' perceptions and experiences are described within. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was distributed to the IWHVC. N = 86 responded to the online survey. Six subsequent focus groups were conducted (N = 36). Participant demographics, barriers, and facilitators of HPV vaccination were summarized. The first three focus groups were coded in an iterative manner based on a coding scheme. The final three focus groups were selectively coded for content related to five themes: barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination, how the coalition has been useful, future directions of the coalition, and how to engage religious communities. RESULTS: Participants suggested that HPV vaccination should occur in a doctor's office (70.9%), public health clinic (64.0%), or at a community health fair (58.1%). Perceived barriers included a lack of education/low knowledge about the HPV vaccine (55.8%), concerns about sexuality/promiscuity (44.2%), and not knowing the vaccine is recommended for boys (38.4%). Participants stressed the importance of gaining buy-in from religious leaders, and felt the coalition helped them advocate for HPV vaccination through networking, idea and information sharing, and voicing their community's needs. Future goals emphasized targeted outreach, sustainable funding, expanded environmental scans, gaining religious support, and policy reforms. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted coalition work builds community capacity and coordinates HPV vaccination efforts. A community driven coalition approach could help improve HPV vaccination in other rural and highly religious regions.",0
1725,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to describe the patterns of use of universally recommended adolescent vaccines in the United States. METHODS: We identified 11-year-olds using the MarketScan insurance claims database (2009-2014). Human papillomavirus (HPV), tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap), and meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccination claims were identified using diagnosis and procedure codes. Generalized linear models estimated vaccination incidence rates and correlates of adolescent vaccination and timely vaccination. RESULTS: Among 1,691,223 adolescents, receipt of Tdap (52.1%) and MenACWY (45.8%) vaccinations exceeded receipt of HPV vaccination (18.4%). While both sexes had similar Tdap and MenACWY vaccination proportions, girls received HPV vaccination more frequently than boys (21.9% vs. 15.1%). Adolescents received HPV vaccination later (mean age: 11.8 years) than Tdap or MenACWY vaccination (mean age: 11.2 years for both). Half of vaccinated adolescents received Tdap and MenACWY vaccination only; however, coadministration with HPV vaccine increased with birth cohort. Western adolescents had the highest incidence rates of HPV vaccination, and Southern adolescents had the lowest. Rural adolescents were less likely than urban adolescents to receive each vaccination except in the Northeast, where they were more likely to receive HPV vaccination (incidence rate ratio: 1.09, 95% confidence interval: 1.2005-1.13). Timely HPV vaccination was associated with female sex, urbanicity, Western residence, and later birth cohort. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination occurred later than Tdap or MenACWY vaccination and was less frequent in boys and rural adolescents. Girls, Western and urban residents, and younger birth cohorts were more likely to receive timely HPV vaccination. Vaccine coadministration increased over time and may encourage timely and complete vaccination coverage.",0
1726,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, Zambia has the highest cervical cancer incidence rates (58.4/100,000 per year) and mortality rates (36.2/100,000 per year). The human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine is considered a vital preventative measure against cervical cancer, particularly in sub-Saharan countries, such as Zambia. Past research suggests health professionals' experiences with HPV vaccination rollout can have practical implications for effective delivery. OBJECTIVE: To explore health professionals' perspectives on the HPV vaccination programme in Zambia. METHODS: Researcher travelled to Zambia and conducted semi-structured interviews with fifteen health professionals working in private, government, and missionary clinics/hospitals. Observation was conducted for triangulation purposes. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. FINDINGS: Five main themes emerged; medical misconceptions about the HPV vaccination, particularly with regards to infertility; fear of the unknown, including possible side effects and inadequate empirical research; need for prior desensitisation to resolve cultural barriers prior to vaccination rollout; a rural-urban divide in health awareness, particularly in relation to cancer vaccines; and economic concerns associated with access to the HPV vaccination for most of the Zambian population. CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings indicate that an essential avenue for facilitating HPV vaccination rollout in Zambia is by implementing a pre-rollout community effort that removes or softens cultural barriers, particularly in rural areas. It is also essential to correct erroneous HPV presumptions health professionals may have around infertility. Affordability remains a seemingly intractable hindrance that hampers HPV vaccination rollout in Zambia.",0
1727,"PURPOSE: Uptake and completion of the 3-dose human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is important for the primary prevention of cervical cancer. However, HPV vaccination rates among adolescent females and young women remain low in certain geographic areas of the United States, including Appalachia. Although greater fatalistic beliefs have been previously associated with lower rates of preventive cancer behaviors among adults, little research exists on the impact of fatalism on HPV vaccination behaviors, especially among younger individuals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the association between fatalistic beliefs and completion of the full HPV vaccine series among young women, ages 18-26, in Appalachian Kentucky. RESULTS: Data from this study were from a baseline survey completed by 344 women randomized into a communication intervention trial focused on increasing adherence to the 3-dose HPV vaccine series. Principal components analysis was used to construct 2 fatalism-related subscales from 8 survey questions. FINDINGS: In a controlled analysis, 1 subscale--""lack of control over cancer""--was significantly associated with not completing the full HPV vaccine series. In a rural area that experiences higher rates of cervical cancer, poverty, limited access to health care, and negative cancer-related attitudes and experiences, fatalism may be common, even among young people. CONCLUSION: Future educational and interventional research addressing fatalistic beliefs in a culturally sensitive manner may be warranted to improve HPV vaccination behaviors and impact cancer disparities among Appalachian women.",0
1728,"Completion of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series is a national priority. This study not only identified correlates of intent to complete the vaccine series and actual series completion, but also tested the efficacy of a DVD intervention to promote series completion. Women's beliefs that all three doses reduced cancer risk predicted intent and completion. Intention predicted completion, as did the belief that having a friend accompany the woman would promote completion. Beyond these effects, women assigned to the intervention were 2.44 times more likely than women in the control group to complete the series. Thus, in controlled analyses, a theory-grounded DVD intervention successfully promoted HPV series completion in a community setting. This method of intervention has high translational potential.",0
1729,"INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates remain marginal across the U.S., including Kentucky, a state recognized for increased HPV-related cancer burden. School-based HPV immunization programs may be a viable approach to improving vaccination initiation and completion rates among youth. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to design, implement, and evaluate a school-based HPV vaccination program conducted in rural south-central Kentucky. METHODS: Guided by evidence-based approaches to increasing immunization rates, the practical expertise of school nursing staff, and a detailed study protocol, academic and health department-based investigators implemented an HPV vaccination project in two high schools during the 2012-2013 academic year; data were analyzed in 2013-2014. Rates of returned parental consent forms, parental consent/declination, and HPV vaccination rates were documented. RESULTS: At the beginning of the school year, all 935 students at the two schools were given HPV vaccination parental consent forms. Five hundred eleven students returned consent forms (55% return rate), and 447 of these students were HPV vaccine naïve (87%). Of these students, 315 (70%) initiated the vaccine series, with 276 (62%) completing the entire three-dose series, so that 88% of students initiating the vaccine series successfully completed the series. In estimating rates for the entire school body, 45% of students had received all three doses by the end of the project. CONCLUSIONS: Despite study design limitations, results of this project provide further evidence about school-based immunization programs as an effective strategy for improving HPV vaccination rates among Kentucky and U.S. adolescents.",0
1730,"BACKGROUND: HPV vaccination is the primary prevention method for HPV-related cancers, although among Hispanic populations, migrant farmworkers may experience exacerbated challenges to HPV vaccination due to intersecting political, social, and personal contexts. This study explored multi-level determinants of HPV vaccination among Hispanic migrant farmworker families. METHODS: Using a community-engaged approach and guided by the socio-ecological model, Intervention Mapping, and PRECEDE-PROCEED constructs, we recruited parents who had a daughter and/or son age 9-15 years from a rural, faith-based, community organization in Florida. Three focus groups (n = 13) were conducted in Spanish and constant comparison methods were used to analyze qualitative data. RESULTS: Micro-level determinants included moderate HPV vaccine knowledge, desire for more HPV vaccine information, concerns about HPV vaccine completion, health/preventive motivations, past experiences with the healthcare system, and parental gender roles related to health care. Macro-level determinants included facilitators (e.g. transportation services, clinics open after work hours, governmental programs) and barriers (e.g. supervisor/employment inflexibility, long clinic wait times) to accessing health care and vaccination in general (including HPV vaccination). Participants shared their preferences for future interventions that would meet the needs of this community, and discussed potential content and mechanisms for receiving HPV information, as well as what might facilitate their overall access, uptake, and completion of the HPV vaccine series. DISCUSSION: Determinants to HPV vaccination emerged and underscore the importance of addressing the multi-level factors when designing and delivering an HPV vaccine intervention for this Hispanic migrant farmworker population. Improving HPV vaccination rates requires responding to situational and structural hardships that disproportionately impact this group. Thus, community-tailored and culturally appropriate multi-level interventions are needed, while emphasizing existing knowledge assets and preferences favorable towards HPV vaccination, with the ultimate goal of the decreasing HPV-related disparities. Findings suggest interventions must reach beyond the individual level to account for this unique population's lived experiences.",0
1731,"BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination in Nigeria will require substantial financing due to high cost of HPV vaccine and inexistence of structures to support adolescent vaccination. Alternative sources are needed to sustain the government funded HPV vaccination programme. This study assessed Nigerian mothers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for HPV vaccine. We also compared the difference between the average WTP and estimated costs of vaccinating a pre-adolescent girl (CVG). METHODS: We conducted a quantitative, cross-sectional, survey-based study in which 50 questionnaires were distributed to each of 10 secondary schools located in two rural and one urban city in Anambra state. The questionnaires were then randomly distributed to girls aged 9-12 years of age to give to their mothers. Contingent valuation approach using the payment card technique was used to estimate the average maximum WTP among the survey participants. Correlates of WTP for HPV vaccination were obtained using multivariate logistic regression. Estimated CVG was obtained by adapting cost of HPV vaccine delivery in Tanzania to the Nigerian setting. RESULTS: A total of 438 questionnaires (88 %) were returned. The average WTP was US$ 11.68. This is opposed to estimated delivery cost of US$ 18.16 and US$ 19.26 for urban and rural populations respectively at vaccine price offered by the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and US$ 35.16 and US$ 36.26 for urban and rural populations respectively at the lowest obtainable public sector vaccine price. Demand for HPV vaccine was deemed high (91.6 %) and was significantly associated with respondents previously diagnosed of HPV infection. CONCLUSION: Demand for HPV vaccine was high although short of estimated CVG. High demand for vaccine should be capitalized upon to increase vaccine uptake. Education on cervical cancer and provider-initiated vaccination should be promoted to increase vaccine uptake. Co-payment could be a feasible financing strategy in the event of national HPV vaccination.",0
1732,"An ideal prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine would provide broadly protective and long-lasting immune responses against all high-risk HPV types, would be effective after a single dose, and would be formulated in such a manner to allow for long-term storage without the necessity for refrigeration. We have developed candidate HPV vaccines consisting of bacteriophage virus-like particles (VLPs) that display a broadly neutralizing epitope derived from the HPV16 minor capsid protein, L2. Immunization with 16L2 VLPs elicited high titer and broadly cross-reactive and cross-neutralizing antibodies against diverse HPV types. In this study we introduce two refinements for our candidate vaccines, with an eye towards enhancing efficacy and clinical applicability in the developing world. First, we assessed the role of antigen dose and boosting on immunogenicity. Mice immunized with 16L2-MS2 VLPs at doses ranging from 2 to 25 μg with or without alum were highly immunogenic at all doses; alum appeared to have an adjuvant effect at the lowest dose. Although boosting enhanced antibody titers, even a single immunization could elicit strong and long-lasting antibody responses. We also developed a method to enhance vaccine stability. Using a spray dry apparatus and a combination of sugars & an amino acid as protein stabilizers, we generated dry powder vaccine formulations of our L2 VLPs. Spray drying of our L2 VLPs did not affect the integrity or immunogenicity of VLPs upon reconstitution. Spray dried VLPs were stable at room temperature and at 37 °C for over one month and the VLPs were highly immunogenic. Taken together, these enhancements are designed to facilitate implementation of a next-generation VLP-based HPV vaccine which addresses U.S. and global disparities in vaccine affordability and access in rural/remote populations.",0
1733,"PURPOSE: In Victoria (Australia), the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is delivered within a state-wide secondary school vaccine program, administered by local government. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that sending a short message service (SMS) reminder to parents who had consented to their child's receiving the HPV vaccine would lead to greater uptake of the vaccine within the program. The secondary aim was to assess the effect of self-regulatory versus motivational message content in the SMS. METHODS: A randomized control trial design was used across 31 schools within seven local government areas. Parents of 4,386 consented adolescents were randomized into three study conditions: motivational SMS versus self-regulatory SMS versus no SMS. Follow-up extended beyond the final school visit to the end of the calendar year to capture those who may have attended a catch-up vaccination session. RESULTS: On the day of the final school visit, 85.71% of consented students in the control condition received the HPV vaccine, compared with 88.35% (2.64% point increase) in the motivational message condition, and 89.00% (3.29% point increase) in the self-regulatory message condition, χ2 (2, N = 4,386) = 8.31, p = .016. Both intervention messages were similarly effective at increasing vaccination rates. This effect was maintained in the extended follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The trial findings supported the hypothesis that SMS reminders to parents/guardians would lead to greater uptake of the HPV vaccine in adolescents participating in school-based vaccination. Also, this effect was observed whether we used a motivational or self-regulatory message framework. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12617001307392).

1734,"PURPOSE: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake remains low. Although publicly funded programs provide free or low cost vaccines to low-income children, barriers aside from cost may prevent disadvantaged girls from getting vaccinated. Prior studies have shown distance to health care as a potential barrier to utilizing pediatric preventive services. This study examines whether HPV vaccines are geographically accessible for low-income girls in Los Angeles County and whether proximity to safety-net clinics is associated with vaccine initiation. METHODS: Interviews were conducted in multiple languages with largely immigrant, low-income mothers of girls ages 9 to 18 via a county health hotline to assess uptake and correlates of uptake. Addresses of respondents and safety-net clinics that provide the HPV vaccine for free or low cost were geo-coded and linked to create measures of geographic proximity. Logistic regression models were estimated for each proximity measure on HPV vaccine initiation while controlling for other factors. RESULTS: On average, 83% of the 468 girls had at least one clinic within 3-miles of their residence. The average travel time on public transportation to the nearest clinic among all girls was 21min. Average proximity to clinics differed significantly by race/ethnicity. Latinas had both the shortest travel distances (2.2 miles) and public transportation times (16min) compared to other racial/ethnic groups. The overall HPV vaccine initiation rate was 25%. Increased proximity to the nearest clinic was not significantly associated with initiation. By contrast, daughter's age and insurance status were significantly associated with increased uptake. CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to examine geographic access to HPV vaccines for underserved girls. Although the majority of girls live in close proximity to safety-net vaccination services, rates of initiation were low. Expanding clinic outreach in this urban area is likely more important than increasing geographic access to the vaccine for this population.",0
1735,"PURPOSE: While HPV vaccines can greatly benefit adolescents and young women from high-risk areas, little is known about whether safety-net immunization services are geographically accessible to communities at greatest risk for HPV-associated diseases. We explore the spatial relationship between areas with high HPV risk and proximity to safety-net clinics from an ecologic perspective. METHODS: We used cancer registry data and Chlamydia surveillance data to identify neighborhoods within Los Angeles County with high risk for HPV-associated cancers. We examined proximity to safety-net clinics among neighborhoods with the highest risk. Proximity was measured as the shortest distance between each neighborhood center and the nearest clinic and having a clinic within 3 miles of each neighborhood center. RESULTS: The average 5-year non-age-adjusted rates were 1,940 cases per 100,000 for Chlamydia and 60 per 100,000 for HPV-associated cancers. A large majority, 349 of 386 neighborhoods with high HPV-associated cancer rates and 532 of 537 neighborhoods with high Chlamydia rates, had a clinic within 3 miles of the neighborhood center. Clinics were more likely to be located within close proximity to high-risk neighborhoods in the inner city. High-risk neighborhoods outside of this urban core area were less likely to be near accessible clinics. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of high-risk neighborhoods were geographically near safety-net clinics with HPV vaccination services. Due to low rates of vaccination, these findings suggest that while services are geographically accessible, additional efforts are needed to improve uptake. Programs aimed to increase awareness about the vaccine and to link underserved groups to vaccination services are warranted.",0
1736,"Background: Despite its effectiveness in preventing human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the rate of uptake of the HPV vaccine is low in Vietnam. This study aimed to investigate barriers related to knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) about the HPV vaccine and willingness to pay (WTP) for the vaccine among those using services in an urban vaccination clinic in Hanoi, Vietnam. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a vaccination clinic of the Institute for Preventive Medicine and Public Health in Hanoi, Vietnam, from March to April 2016. KAP on the HPV vaccine was collected using a structured questionnaire. Double-bounded dichotomous-choice questions with open-ended questions were used to examine the WTP of respondents. Interval regression and stepwise logistic models were used to identify factors associated with WTP and the average amount that people would be willing to pay for the vaccine. Results: Of 492 vaccination service users, 67.9%, 94.6%, and 12.3% of respondents were aware of the best age for HPV vaccination, its benefits, and the target group for vaccination, respectively. While the majority believed that the HPV vaccine was safe (92.8%) and effective (90.8%), and desired to be vaccinated (71.1%), only 31.8% of users were vaccinated. Most of the respondents were willing to pay for the HPV vaccine (86.6%), and willing to pay an average amount of US$49.3. Those aged 20-29 years and earning more than 22 million VND/month (very rich) were more likely to pay for the HPV vaccine than people aged <20 years and earning <7 million VND/month. Users who had attained more than a high-school education and heard about the HPV vaccine from doctors, nurses, or other health professionals tended to be willing to pay for the vaccine at a lower price than individuals with below secondary-level education and who had not heard about the vaccine from these health professionals. Conclusion: Sexual health education and financial assistance should be imparted alongside the HPV vaccination program.",0
1737,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have the potential to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality, particularly in the parts of the developing world that bear the greatest burden of disease. This research sought to predict the impact and cost-effectiveness of an HPV vaccination program in an example low-resource country with a high burden of cervical cancer: Mali, West Africa. METHODS: Novel compartmental mathematical models projected the impact of adolescent HPV vaccination in urban and rural areas of Mali. The models accounted for two high-risk vaccine-types: HPV 16 and 18. We then attached comprehensive real cost and cost-effectiveness estimates. RESULTS: Our models predict that HPV vaccination in Mali will reduce cervical cancer burden by a factor roughly equal to vaccine coverage. A point vaccination program was simulated in a cohort of 333,146 urban and 588,982 rural Malian women, age 10-14. Vaccination of 50% of girls reduced the peak prevalence of HPV 16/18 to 5.0% in the urban setting and 9.6% in the rural setting, down from 11.7% and 22.0%, respectively, with no vaccination. The 50% vaccination scenario averted 1145 cervical cancer deaths in the urban group and 2742 in the rural group. The cost per discounted life-year saved in this scenario was 1030 US dollars (urban) and 725 dollars (rural). The cost per life-year saved was higher at 90% coverage, but was still in the range of a ""cost-effective"" public health intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This research yielded the most comprehensive real cost estimates of HPV vaccination yet published for sub-Saharan Africa. Our models indicate that HPV vaccination in Mali will be cost-effective when introduced. To maximize the benefit using limited resources, vaccination programs may begin with a target coverage of about 50%. We anticipate that costs of reaching late adopters after the First Vaccinated Wave of vaccination will be higher, but worthwhile.",0
1738,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent HPV vaccination in minority and low income populations with high cervical cancer incidence and mortality could reduce disparities. Safety-net primary care clinics are a key delivery site for improving vaccination rates in these populations. PURPOSE: To examine prevalence of HPV initiation (≥ 1 dose), completion (receipt of dose 3 within 12 months of initiation), and receipt of 3 doses in four safety-net clinics as well as individual-, household-, and clinic-level correlates of initiation. METHODS: We used multilevel modeling to investigate HPV initiation among 700 adolescent females who sought primary care in four safety-net clinics in Dallas, Texas from March 2007 to December 2009. Data were abstracted from patients' paper and electronic medical records. RESULTS: HPV vaccine uptake varied significantly by clinic. Across clinics, initiation was 36.6% and completion was 39.7% among those who initiated. In the total study population, only 15.7% received all three doses. In multivariate, two-level logistic regression analyses, initiation was associated with receipt of other adolescent vaccines, influenza vaccination in the year prior to data abstraction, being sexually active, and having more chart documentation (presence of health maintenance questionnaire and/or immunization record). There was no association between initiation and age, race/ethnicity, or insurance status. CONCLUSIONS: In four urban safety-net clinics, HPV initiation rates paralleled 2008 national rates. The correlation of HPV initiation with other adolescent vaccines underscores the importance of reviewing vaccination status at every health care visit. HPV vaccine uptake in safety-net clinics should continue to be monitored to understand impact on cervical cancer disparities.",0
1739,"BACKGROUND: Anogenital warts (AGW) are caused by the most common sexually transmitted infection, human papillomavirus. The objective of this study was to examine AGW incidence from 1990 to 2011 by sex, age, income quintile, and residential area category (urban/rural). The study period included the initiation of school-based HPV vaccination for girls in the sixth grade, which began in 2008. The data presented in this paper may also be useful for establishing baseline rates of AGW incidence which may be used to evaluate the success of the school-based HPV immunization program. METHODS: Cases of anogenital warts were identified using Manitoba's administrative databases of Physician Claims and Hospital Discharge Abstracts. Annual age-standardized incidence in Manitoba from 1990 to 2011 was calculated. Incident AGW rates were compared by sex, age group, residential area category (urban/rural), and household income quintile using logistic regression. Joinpoint regression analyses were used to evaluate the time trends of AGW. RESULTS: Prior to 2000, AGW incidence was higher among females than males. However, from 2000 to 2011 the incidence was higher among males and increased steadily over time. AGW incidence tended to peak in younger age groups among females compared to males. Females and males living in urban areas had nearly twice the odds of AGW occurrence compared to those in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for education about AGW in male population. The upcoming initiation of HPV vaccination among boys may reduce the incidence and should be evaluated.",0
1740,"PURPOSE: To identify predictors of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among rural African American families. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study in schools in three rural counties in southeastern United States. The sample consisted of African American parents or caregivers with children 9 to 13 years of age who attended elementary or middle school in 2010-2011. METHODS: Using an anonymous, 26-item survey, we collected descriptive data during parent-teacher events from African American parents with children in elementary or middle school. The main outcome was measured as a response of ""yes"" to the statement ""I have or will vaccinate my child with the HPV vaccine."" In addition, composite scores of knowledge and positive attitudes and beliefs were compared. No interventions were conducted. FINDINGS: We identified predictors of HPV vaccination and found that religious affiliation had a correlation with vaccinating or planning to vaccinate a child. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a need for further research on the role of local culture, including religion and faith, in rural African Americans' decisions about giving their children the HPV vaccination. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study emphasizes the importance of understanding rural African American parents' knowledge, attitudes, and spiritual beliefs when designing health education programs and public health interventions to increase HPV vaccination uptake among African American boys and girls living in rural areas.",0
1741,"The latest version of human coronavirus said to be COVID-19 came out as a sudden pandemic disease within human population and in the absence of vaccination and proper treatment till date, it daunting threats heavily to human lives, infecting more than 12, 11, 214 people and death more than 67, 666 people in 208 countries across the globe as on April 06, 2020, which is highly alarming. When no treatment or vaccine is available till date and to avoid COVID-19 to be transmitted in the community, social distancing is the only way to prevent the disease, which is well taken into account in our novel epidemic models as a special compartment, that is, home isolation. Based on the transmitting behavior of COVID-19 in the human population, we develop three quarantine models of this pandemic taking into account the compartments: susceptible population, immigrant population, home isolation population, infectious population, hospital quarantine population, and recovered population. Local and global asymptotic stability is proved for all the three models. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to establish the analytical results with suitable examples. Our research reveals that home isolation and quarantine to hospitals are the two pivot force-control policies under the present situation when no treatment is available for this pandemic.",0
1742,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, firstly reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, has rapidly spread around the world with high mortality rate among critically ill patients. The use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 remains a major controversy. Available evidences are inconclusive. According to WHO guidance, corticosteroids are not recommended to be used unless for another reason. Chinese Thoracic Society (CTS) proposes an expert consensus statement that suggests taking a prudent attitude of corticosteroid usage. In our clinical practice, we do not use corticosteroids routinely; only low-to-moderate doses of corticosteroids were given to several severely ill patients prudently. In this paper, we will present two confirmed severe COVID-19 cases admitted to isolation wards in Optical Valley Campus of Tongji hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. We will discuss questions related to corticosteroids usages.",0
1743,"BACKGROUND: The fatality rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Italy is controversial and is greatly affecting discussion on the impact of containment measures that are straining the world's social and economic fabric, such as instigating large-scale isolation and quarantine, closing borders, imposing limits on public gatherings, and implementing nationwide lockdowns. OBJECTIVE: The scientific community, citizens, politicians, and mass media are expressing concerns regarding data suggesting that the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Italy is significantly higher than in the rest of the world. Moreover, Italian citizens have misleading perceptions related to the number of swab tests that have actually been performed. Citizens and mass media are denouncing the coverage of COVID-19 swab testing in Italy, claiming that it is not in line with that in other countries worldwide. METHODS: In this paper, we attempt to clarify the aspects of COVID-19 fatalities and testing in Italy by performing a set of statistical analyses that highlight the actual numbers in Italy and compare them with official worldwide data. RESULTS: The analysis clearly shows that the Italian COVID-19 fatality and mortality rates are in line with the official world scenario, as are the numbers of COVID-19 tests performed in Italy and in the Lombardy region. CONCLUSIONS: This up-to-date analysis may elucidate the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.",0
1744,"The data pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic has been rapidly evolving since the first confirmed case in December 2019. This review article presents a comprehensive analysis of the current data in relation to COVID-19 and its effect on pregnant women, including symptoms, disease severity and the risk of vertical transmission. We also review the recommended management of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and the various pharmacological agents that are being investigated and may have a role in the treatment of this disease. At present, it does not appear that pregnant women are at increased risk of severe infection than the general population, although there are vulnerable groups within both the pregnant and nonpregnant populations, and clinicians should be cognizant of these high-risk groups and manage them accordingly. Approximately 85% of women will experience mild disease, 10% more severe disease and 5% critical disease. The most common reported symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea. Neither vaginal delivery nor cesarean section confers additional risks, and there is minimal risk of vertical transmission to the neonate from either mode of delivery. We acknowledge that the true effect of the virus on both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality will only be evident over time. We also discuss the impact of social isolation can have on the mental health and well-being of both patients and colleagues, and as clinicians, we must be mindful of this and offer support as necessary.",0
1745,"BACKGROUND: Low infection and case-fatality rates have been thus far observed in Taiwan. One of the reasons for this major success is better use of big data analytics in efficient contact tracing and management and surveillance of those who require quarantine and isolation. OBJECTIVE: We present here a unique application of big data analytics among Taiwanese people who had contact with more than 3000 passengers that disembarked at Keelung harbor in Taiwan for a 1-day tour on January 31, 2020, 5 days before the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the Diamond Princess cruise ship on February 5, 2020, after an index case was identified on January 20, 2020. METHODS: The smart contact tracing-based mobile sensor data, cross-validated by other big sensor surveillance data, were analyzed by the mobile geopositioning method and rapid analysis to identify 627,386 potential contact-persons. Information on self-monitoring and self-quarantine was provided via SMS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were offered for symptomatic contacts. National Health Insurance claims big data were linked, to follow-up on the outcome related to COVID-19 among those who were hospitalized due to pneumonia and advised to undergo screening for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: As of February 29, a total of 67 contacts who were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were all negative and no confirmed COVID-19 cases were found. Less cases of respiratory syndrome and pneumonia were found after the follow-up of the contact population compared with the general population until March 10, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Big data analytics with smart contact tracing, automated alert messaging for self-restriction, and follow-up of the outcome related to COVID-19 using health insurance data could curtail the resources required for conventional epidemiological contact tracing.",0
1746,"Italy has been hit very hard by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. This brief report highlights some of the peculiarities manifested by its older adult population, with particular reference to those living in nursing institutions and at home. Mortality data (as of 26 April) are reported, together with reactions to forced isolation, loneliness, and fear of contracting the disease, which represent big challenges for all, especially for frail elderly people.",0
1747,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected care home residents internationally, with 19-72% of COVID-19 deaths occurring in care homes. COVID-19 presents atypically in care home residents and up to 56% of residents may test positive whilst pre-symptomatic. In this article, we provide a commentary on challenges and dilemmas identified in the response to COVID-19 for care homes and their residents. We highlight the low sensitivity of PCR testing and the difficulties this poses for blanket screening and isolation of residents. We discuss quarantine of residents and the potential harms associated with this. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply for care homes during the pandemic has been suboptimal and we suggest that better integration of procurement and supply is required. Advance care planning has been challenged by the pandemic and there is a need to for healthcare staff to provide support to care homes with this. Finally, we discuss measures to implement augmented care in care homes, including treatment with oxygen and subcutaneous fluids, and the frameworks which will be required if these are to be sustainable. All of these challenges must be met by healthcare, social care and government agencies if care home residents and staff are to be physically and psychologically supported during this time of crisis for care homes.",0
1748,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly around the world since it was first recognized in late 2019. Most early reports of person-to-person SARS-CoV-2 transmission have been among household contacts, where the secondary attack rate has been estimated to exceed 10% (1), in health care facilities (2), and in congregate settings (3). However, widespread community transmission, as is currently being observed in the United States, requires more expansive transmission events between nonhousehold contacts. In February and March 2020, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) investigated a large, multifamily cluster of COVID-19. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 and their close contacts were interviewed to better understand nonhousehold, community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This report describes the cluster of 16 cases of confirmed or probable COVID-19, including three deaths, likely resulting from transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at two family gatherings (a funeral and a birthday party). These data support current CDC social distancing recommendations intended to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. U.S residents should follow stay-at-home orders when required by state or local authorities.",0
1749,"Masks are widely discussed during the course of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Most hospitals have implemented universal masking for their healthcare workers, and the Center for Disease Control currently advises even the general public to wear cloth masks when outdoors. The pertinent need for masks arises from plausible dissemination of the SARS-CoV-2 through close contacts, as well as the possibility of virus transmission from asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and mildly symptomatic individuals. Given current global shortages in personal protective equipment, the efficacy of various types of masks: N95 respirators, surgical masks, and cloth masks are researched. To accommodate limited supplies, techniques for extended use, reuse, and sterilization of masks are strategized. However, masks alone may not greatly slow down the COVID-19 pandemic unless they are coupled with adequate social distancing, diligent hand hygiene, and other proven preventive measures.",0
1750,"With more than three billion people in isolation, the status of digital spaces is switching from an amenity to a necessity, as they become not only the main way to access information and services, but also one of the only remaining vectors for economic, educational, and leisure activities as well as for social interactions to take place. However, not all are equals in terms of access to networks or connected devices, or when it comes to the skills required to navigate computerized spaces optimally. Digital inequalities were already existing, yet the COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating them dramatically. On the one hand, the crisis will worsen digital inequalities within the population. On the other hand, digital inequalities represent a major risk factor of vulnerability for exposure to the virus itself, and for the non-sanitary consequences of the crisis. Therefore, this paper aims at exploring the reciprocal impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and digital inequalities, and to propose operative solutions to help fight the nefarious consequences of the crisis. We first describe how digital inequalities are a determinant of health. We then investigate how COVID-19 can potentiate digital inequalities, and how digital inequalities potentiate vulnerability to COVID-19. Finally, in order to contribute to the mitigation of this crisis, we propose a set of multi-layered strategies focusing on actionability that can be implemented at multiple structural levels, ranging from governmental to corporate and community levels.",0
1751,"Objectives Public behaviour change is necessary to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) framework, this study presents an examination of individual differences in some relevant psychological factors. Design Cross-sectional psychometric. Methods UK respondents (N = 202) completed a personality questionnaire (RST-PQ), measures of illness attitudes, concerns about the impact of coronavirus on health services and socio-economic infrastructures, personal safety, and likelihood of voluntary self-isolation. Results Respondents most concerned were older, had negative illness attitudes, and scored higher on reward reactivity (RR), indicating the motivation to take positive approach action despite prevailing worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns were highest in those with negative illness attitudes and higher fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance) scores. Results suggest people are experiencing psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable (RR-related) life. Ways of ameliorating conflict may include maladaptive behaviours (panic buying), reflecting reward-related displacement activity. Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Conclusions Interventions need to consider individual differences in psychological factors in behaviour change, and we discuss relevant literature to inform policy makers and communicators. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) personality systems can influence perception of persuasive health messages. However, there is limited evidence for their direct effects on health concerns and behaviours, and none relating to specific infectious diseases. What does this study add? Reward reactivity (RR) is associated with concern about impact of coronavirus on the NHS and other social infrastructures, indicating the motivation to take positive-approach action despite worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns are related to fight-flight-freeze system traits (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance). Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Results suggest psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable life (RR-related). Ways of ameliorating conflict may include maladaptive behaviours (panic buying), reflecting reward-related displacement activity.",0
1752,"Zimbabwe is among the countries that have been identified to be at risk of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the 15th of March 2020, there was no confirmed case of the virus. Official reports of suspected cases were used to appraise the general screening, case management, and the emergency preparedness and response of the country towards the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of the surveillance and capacity to screen at the ports of entry, the country seems to be faring well. The country might not be screening optimally, considering the number of COVID-19 tests conducted to date and the suspected cases who missed testing. Three of the suspected cases faced mental, social, and psychological consequences due to them being suspected cases of COVID-19. There is a need to enhance the screening process and infrastructure at all the ports of entry. More COVID-19 diagnostic tests should be procured to increase the testing capacity. Training and awareness on mental, social, and psychological consequences of COVID-19 should be offered to the health care workers and the general public. More financial resources should be sourced to enable the country control the pandemic.",0
1754,"The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused sudden and dramatic societal changes. The allergy/immunology community has quickly responded by mobilizing practice adjustments and embracing new paradigms of care to protect patients and staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure. Social distancing is key to slowing contagion but adds to complexity of care and increases isolation and anxiety. Uncertainty exists across a new COVID-19 reality, and clinician well-being may be an underappreciated priority. Wellness incorporates mental, physical, and spiritual health to protect against burnout, which impairs both coping and caregiving abilities. Understanding the stressors that COVID-19 is placing on clinicians can assist in recognizing what is needed to return to a point of wellness. Clinicians can leverage easily accessible tools, including the Strength-Focused and Meaning-Oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation approach, wellness apps, mindfulness, and gratitude. Realizing early warning signs of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder is important to access safe and confidential resources. Implementing wellness strategies can improve flexibility, resilience, and outlook. Historical parallels demonstrate that perseverance is as inevitable as pandemics and that we need not navigate this unprecedented time alone.",0
1756,"The international community is currently facing a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. This syndrome has been named COVID-19 for CoronaVIrus Disease 2019 by the World Health Organization. The starting point of the epidemic is the city of Wuhan (China), where the virus is said to have been transmitted from animals to humans before inter-human transmission. This is the third epidemic caused by a coronavirus after those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) started in 2012. COVID-19 has rapidly spread to China and is currently spreading all over the world. The infection mainly affects patients over 40 years of age and mortality is increased in the presence of comorbidities. Children are pauci- or asymptomatic. The diagnosis is most often based on the detection of the viral genome in the nasopharynx by molecular biology methods. In the absence of specific anti-viral molecules, treatment is currently mainly symptomatic. It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is more difficult to control than what the first data suggested. The key strategy to SARS-CoV-2 is to limit its transmission. Preventive measures are mainly based on the application of adequate hand hygiene measures and disinfection of the environment, as well as measures of social distance aimed at limiting contacts in the population and protecting populations at risk.",0
1757,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2, represents the greatest medical challenge in decades. We provide a comprehensive review of the clinical course of COVID-19, its comorbidities, and mechanistic considerations for future therapies. While COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, causing interstitial pneumonitis and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it also affects multiple organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Risk of severe infection and mortality increase with advancing age and male sex. Mortality is increased by comorbidities: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer. The most common complications include arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and ventricular fibrillation), cardiac injury [elevated highly sensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK) levels], fulminant myocarditis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2, following proteolytic cleavage of its S protein by a serine protease, binds to the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -a homologue of ACE-to enter type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This may lead to myocardial dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque instability, and myocardial infarction (MI). While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, there is no evidence that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) worsen prognosis. Hence, patients should not discontinue their use. Moreover, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors might be beneficial in COVID-19. Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications. Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular considerations of therapies currently used, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, ribavirin, interferons, and lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as experimental therapies, such as human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2), are discussed.",0
1758,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), may predispose patients to thrombotic disease, both in the venous and arterial circulations, because of excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. In addition, many patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for thrombotic disease may develop COVID-19, which can have implications for choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic therapy. Moreover, during a time with much focus on COVID-19, it is critical to consider how to optimize the available technology to care for patients without COVID-19 who have thrombotic disease. Herein, the authors review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, management, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who develop venous or arterial thrombosis, of those with pre-existing thrombotic disease who develop COVID-19, or those who need prevention or care for their thrombotic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
1759,"With the current global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, new challenges arise as social distancing and isolation have become the standard for safety. Evidence supports the protective benefits of social connections and support during pregnancy and labor; there are increased maternal, fetal, and pregnancy risks when pregnant and laboring women lack support. As health care professionals take appropriate precautions to protect patients and themselves from infection, there must be a balance to ensure that we do not neglect the importance of social and emotional support during important milestones such as pregnancy and childbirth. Resources are available to help pregnant women, and technology represents an opportunity for innovation in providing care.",0
1760,"OBJECTIVES: Detailed knowledge on the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the clinical characteristics of mild COVID-19 is essential for effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea. The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Of the 213 individuals with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission. Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1%; 69/172), followed by hyposmia (39.5%; 68/172) and sputum (39.5%; 68/172). Of the 68 individuals with hyposmia, 61 (90%) had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea. Fever (>37.5°C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%) individuals. CONCLUSIONS: As much as one-fifth of individuals with COVID-19 remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission. Hyposmia was quite frequent among individuals with mild COVID-19, but fever was not. Social distancing should be strongly implemented to prevent disease transmission from asymptomatic individuals or those with mild and inconspicuous symptoms.",0
1762,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. The etiologic agent is a novel coronavirus of presumed zoonotic origin with structural similarity to the viruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 infection manifests most frequently with lower respiratory symptoms. A minority of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome/ diffuse alveolar damage. In addition to its central role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, the clinical laboratory provides critical information to clinicians regarding prognosis, disease course, and response to therapy. The purpose of this review is to (a) provide background context about the origins and course of the pandemic, (b) discuss the laboratory's role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, (c) summarize the current state of biomarker analysis in COVID-19 infection, with an emphasis on markers derived from the hematology laboratory, (d) comment on the impact of COVID-19 on hematology laboratory safety, and (e) describe the impact the pandemic has had on organized national and international educational activities worldwide.",0
1763,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2) that began in December 2019 presents a significant and urgent threat to global health. This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease. Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study. A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men). The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]). Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]). Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients. All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]). It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines. Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C-reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase. This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients. Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia. Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.",0
1764,"The Covid-19 pandemic poses a major challenge for the management of collective accommodation centres for refugees. The often-overcrowded facilities hinder satisfactory implementation of social distancing and hygiene practices. Adequate information policies as well as a rapid, efficient management of suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases are essential. However, scientific evidence on this is largely lacking. Besides partially implemented approaches, such as isolation areas or cluster quarantine, plans to evacuate overcrowded facilities should also be considered. The German Public Health Service (ÖGD) plays a vital role in the current Covid-19 pandemic. In order to fulfil their routine tasks of infection control and support health services management for refugee accommodation centres, the ÖGD urgently needs to be strengthened in terms of personnel and material. Additionally, means for a rapid exchange of best practice examples of Covid-19 interventions across federal states as well as collaborative structures and capacity within the ÖGD for accompanying operational research are needed. Refugees, their housing situation and their access to health care need to be included in pandemic plans. Only an integrative health care system can achieve regional and international targets for the control of Covid-19 and other infectious diseases.",0
1765,"A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2) that initially originated from Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has already caused a pandemic. While this novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) frequently induces mild diseases, it has also generated severe diseases among certain populations, including older-aged individuals with underlying diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. As of 31 March 2020, a total of 9786 confirmed cases with covid-19 have been reported in South Korea. South Korea has the highest diagnostic rate for covid-19, which has been the major contributor in overcoming this outbreak. We are trying to reduce the reproduction number of covid-19 to less than one and eventually succeed in controlling this outbreak using methods such as contact tracing, quarantine, testing, isolation, social distancing and school closure. This report aimed to describe the current situation of covid-19 in South Korea and our response to this outbreak.",0
1766,"This study aimed to evaluate the behavioral aspects and beliefs of the population of Ceará in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire was conducted on sociodemographic aspects and opinions related to the pandemic. Absolute and relative frequencies were calculated, the association between variables was performed with Chi-square, and the level of significance was 5%. The final sample had 2,259 participants, and an association was observed between females and perceiving themselves with a high risk of infection (p = 0.044) and males with non-performance of voluntary quarantine (p < 0.001). People aged 80 years and over were partially quarantined due to the flow of people at home (p < 0.001). Participants with elementary school education had a lower risk of infection than participants with a higher level of education (p < 0.001). This group includes people who did voluntary quarantine the least (p < 0.001). Participants living in the inland region of the state had less direct contact with someone tested positive for the Coronavirus (p = 0.031) and are less reclusive (p < 0.001). We can conclude that the approach to the COVID-19 pandemic varies by social aspects, such as gender, age, education, and place of residence, as well as the belief system of the population of the State of Ceará.",0
1767,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a tremendous global impact since it began in November of 2019. However, there are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic will not affect all equally and some populations will be particularly vulnerable. Relevant to liver disease, patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) may be amongst the populations that are the most severely impacted. The reasons for this include being at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to a depressed immune system and high-risk underlying comorbidities, the injurious effect of COVID-19 on the liver, the inability to attend regular visits with providers, diversion of hospital resources, and social isolation leading to psychological decompensation and increased drinking or relapse. As a result, we fear that there will be a dramatic rising tide of alcohol relapse, admissions for decompensated ALD, and an increase in newly diagnosed patients with AUD/ALD post-COVID-19 pandemic. Providers and their institutions should implement pre-emptive strategies such as telehealth and aggressive patient outreach programs now to curb this anticipated problem. Liver transplantation (LT) centers should adapt to the pandemic by considering leniency to some LT candidates with ALD who cannot access appropriate alcohol treatment due to the current situation. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be especially detrimental to patients with AUD/ALD and actions need to be taken now to limit the scope of this anticipated problem.",0
1768,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality since it was first described in December 2019 (1). Based on epidemiologic data showing spread in congregate settings (2-4), national, state, and local governments instituted significant restrictions on large gatherings to prevent transmission of disease in early March 2020. This and other nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have shown initial success in slowing the pandemic across the country (5). This report examines the first 7 weeks (March 1-April 18) of implementation of NPIs in Basic Military Training (BMT) at a U.S. Air Force base. In a population of 10,579 trainees, COVID-19 incidence was limited to five cases (47 per 100,000 persons), three of which were in persons who were contacts of the first patient. Transmission of symptomatic COVID-19 was successfully limited using strategies of quarantine, social distancing, early screening of trainees, rapid isolation of persons with suspected cases, and monitored reentry into training for trainees with positive test results after resolution of symptoms.",0
1769,"A cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019. The cluster was largely associated with a seafood and animal market. A novel Betacoronavirus was quickly identified as the causative agent, and it is shown to be related genetically to SARS-CoV and other bat-borne SARS-related Betacoronaviruses. The number of cases increased rapidly and spread to other provinces in China, as well as to another 4 countries. To help control the spread of the virus, a ""cordon sanitaire"" was instituted for Wuhan on January 23, 2020, and subsequently extended to other cities in Hubei Province, and the outbreak declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the Director General of the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. This article described the evolution of the outbreak, and the known properties of the novel virus, SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical disease it causes, and the major public health measures being used to help control it's spread. These measures include social distancing, intensive surveillance and quarantining of cases, contact tracing and isolation, cancellation of mass gatherings, and community containment. The virus is the third zoonotic coronavirus, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but appears to be the only one with pandemic potential. However, a number of important properties of the virus are still not well understood, and there is an urgent need to learn more about its transmission dynamics, its spectrum of clinical severity, its wildlife origin, and its genetic stability. In addition, more research is needed on possible interventions, particularly therapeutic and vaccines.",0
1770,"Background: On 23rd March 2020 the UK government released self-isolation guidance to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-Cov-2. The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known. Aim: To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation in a sample of the UK public. Methods: This paper presents pre-planned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey. Outcomes: Sexual activity was measured using the following question: ""On average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?"" Demographic and clinical data was collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation. The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: 868 individuals were included in this study. There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years. During self-isolation, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. Clinical Implications: In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption. Strength and Limitations: This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing. Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings. Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic. Conclusion: Interventions to promote health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity.",0
1771,"The recent Coronavirus has been spreading through all the world fastly. In this work we focus on the evolution of the COVID-19 in one of the most populous Brazilian states, namely the Rio de Janeiro state. The first case was reported in March 5, 2020, thus we have a considerable amount of available data to make a good analysis. We study the dynamics of COVID-19 through a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model with an additional mechanism that represents the implementation of public policies of social isolation. Based on the data collected from the Rio de Janeiro state Department of Health from March 5, 2020 through April 26, 2020, we observed that the implementation of social distancing policies changed the initial exponential growth to a sub-exponential one. The SIQR model with the above-mentioned mechanism is capable of reproducing the data of confirmed cases in Rio de Janeiro, and it explains how that change occurred. The model also predicts an important mitigation effect, namely the flattening effect, i.e., the considerably decrease of the maximum number of confirmed cases. Through the results of the model, this effect can be directly related to the social isolation policies. Finally, we consider the relaxation of such policies, and discuss about the ideal period of time to release people to return to their activities.",0
1772,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for people of all ages but particularly devastating to adults 65 and older, which has highlighted the critical need for ensuring that all social workers gain the knowledge and skills necessary to work with this population. While there is a critical shortage of gerontological social workers and we must continue to increase that number, we cannot wait for this to occur. In this commentary, the authors call for infusing the current social work curricula with aging content; providing current social workers with trainings on aging practice; and all social work practitioners, faculty, and researchers to address four specific areas that have gained prominence due to the impact of COVID-19: ageism, loneliness and social isolation, technology, and interprofessional practice, in their respective areas.",0
1773,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to ravage health and economic metrics globally, including progress in maternal and child nutrition. Although there has been focus on rising rates of childhood wasting in the short term, maternal and child undernutrition rates are also likely to increase as a consequence of COVID-19 and its impacts on poverty, coverage of essential interventions, and access to appropriate nutritious foods. Key sectors at particular risk of collapse or reduced efficiency in the wake of COVID-19 include food systems, incomes, and social protection, health care services for women and children, and services and access to clean water and sanitation. This review highlights key areas of concern for maternal and child nutrition during and in the aftermath of COVID-19 while providing strategic guidance for countries in their efforts to reduce maternal and child undernutrition. Rooted in learnings from the exemplars in Global Health's Stunting Reduction Exemplars project, we provide a set of recommendations that span investments in sectors that have sustained direct and indirect impact on nutrition. These include interventions to strengthen the food-supply chain and reducing food insecurity to assist those at immediate risk of food shortages. Other strategies could include targeted social safety net programs, payment deferrals, or tax breaks as well as suitable cash-support programs for the most vulnerable. Targeting the most marginalized households in rural populations and urban slums could be achieved through deploying community health workers and supporting women and community members. Community-led sanitation programs could be key to ensuring healthy household environments and reducing undernutrition. Additionally, several COVID-19 response measures such as contact tracing and self-isolation could also be exploited for nutrition protection. Global health and improvements in undernutrition will require governments, donors, and development partners to restrategize and reprioritize investments for the COVID-19 era, and will necessitate data-driven decision making, political will and commitment, and international unity.",0
1775,"Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 03 May 2020: notifications = 6,784; deaths = 89. The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Currently new notifications in Australia are mostly considered to be locally-acquired with some cases still reported among people with recent overseas travel. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case or known cluster, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case. The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.3%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (7.1%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.7%) and the United Kingdom (15.4%). The lower CFR in Australia is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained.",0

1777,"Aim: COVID-19 presents as a pandemic requiring the utmost attention from the world, especially the healthcare sector. This review intends to discuss the symptoms, prevention, and management carried out related to the coronavirus, while also providing the healthcare provider strategies used by different countries in combating the disease. Subject and methods: This study was conducted over a period of 2 weeks where different sources were used to assess the ongoing situation regarding COVID-19. The data used in this study was verified and collected from authentic sources only. Results: Results show that there is at present no definite cure for the disease and that prevention is the best possible defense at our disposal at the moment. Data reviewed suggests that social distancing and isolation is the best possible option at the moment. Conclusion: This study provides an overview of the developments taking place in response to the pandemic. More research is required, especially in the treatment and prevention of the disease, so that we may progress towards finding a cure as well as creating a vaccine for the COVID-19.",0
1782,"I live in New York City, identified as the epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic. My view differs from that of many of the millions living in this large metropolitan area who are poor. I am not rich, but I am privileged: I have a retirement income for which I have saved all my working life and I have no debts. I am isolated in my apartment having food delivered. But what if I require hospitalization, from Covid-19 or another medical condition? New York State has guidelines for allocation of scarce ventilators in times of scarcity. The guidelines reject advanced age as a criterion for triage because it discriminates against the elderly. Other proposals contend that priority should be given to those who have not yet ;lived a full life. Allocation guidelines set a priority on saving the most lives, but hard choices remain within that broadly defined goal.

1783,"BACKGROUND: People obtain information on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from the internet and other sources. Understanding the factors related to such information sources aids health professionals in educating individuals. OBJECTIVE: This study used data collected from the online survey study on COVID-19 in Taiwan to examine what major COVID-19 information sources are available and which sources are significantly related to the self-confidence of people in coping with COVID-19 in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 1904 participants (1270 non-health-care workers and 634 health care workers) were recruited from the Facebook advertisement. Their major sources of information about COVID-19, the relationships between the sources and demographic factors, and the relationships between the sources and the self-confidence in coping with COVID-19 were surveyed. RESULTS: Most Taiwanese people relied on the internet for COVID-19 information. Many respondents also used a variety of sources of information on COVID-19; such variety was associated with sex, age, and the level of worry toward COVID-19, as well as if one was a health care worker. For health care workers, the use of formal lessons as an information source was significantly associated with better self-confidence in coping with COVID-19. The significant association between receiving information from more sources and greater self-confidence was found only in health care workers but not in non-health-care workers. CONCLUSIONS: Medical professionals should consider subgroups of the population when establishing various means to deliver information on COVID-19.",0
1784,"This perspective examines the challenge posed by COVID-19 for social care services in England and describes responses to this challenge. People with social care needs experience increased risks of death and deteriorating physical and mental health with COVID-19. Social isolation introduced to reduce COVID-19 transmission may adversely affect well-being. While the need for social care rises, the ability of families and social care staff to provide support is reduced by illness and quarantine, implying reductions in staffing levels. Consequently, COVID-19 could seriously threaten care availability and quality. The government has sought volunteers to work in health and social care to help address the threat posed by staff shortages at a time of rising need, and the call has achieved an excellent response. The government has also removed some barriers to effective coordination between health and social care, while introducing measures to promote the financial viability of care providers. The pandemic presents unprecedented challenges that require well-co-coordinated responses across central and local government, health services, and non-government sectors.",0
1786,"Rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in Wuhan province in China. SARS-CoV-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March 2020. This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple, Texas. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. More than 3500 tests were performed during the first 2 weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1659 emergency department/inpatients tested were positive. The highest rate of infection (6.9%) was seen in patients aged 25 to 34 years, while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged <25 years old (2%). County-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions. Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about SARS-CoV-2 among the general public, as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to SARS-CoV-2. Data extracted for BSWH from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System site revealed that Influenza incidence was 8.7% in March 2020, compared with 25% in March 2019. This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management. This study provided SARS-CoV-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population. Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2.",0
1787,"BACKGROUND: In the midst of the SARS-CoV 2 pandemic basic healthcare challenges arise as lockdowns and social isolation are implemented to prevent the spread of the virus. In order to overcome these challenges, the Polish the National Health Fund has facilitated telemedical consultations. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare teleconsultations to regular ambulatory clinic of implantable devices (ACIM) visits and to assess whether teleconsultations would be an adequate replacement during a time when face-to-face contact should be limited. METHODS: Teleconsultations in the ACIM were introduced for patients without the possibility of remote control cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED). Prior to planned visits physicians made phone calls and interviewed the patient about their health. Further treatment decisions were made based on the interview and available documentation. RESULTS: Teleconsultations were performed during a 3.5-week period (13.03.2020 to 01.04.2020). Of the 400 patients planned for visits in the ACIM, 349 were consulted by phone. 299 patients confirmed stable health. 14/349 patients reported some symptoms and 4/349 patients were hospitalized; 2/349 patients changed their primary ACIM and were no longer under our care, 1/349 patient was undergoing quarantine, 15/349 patients required additional intervention and 15 patients had died prior to contact. In general patients gave positive feedback on their teleconsultations. CONCLUSIONS: Teleconsultations are a much-needed solution during the COVID-19 pandemic. They are an effective way to decrease interpersonal contact and to overcome sudden changes to the visitation scheme which may otherwise have put an overwhelming burden on the ACIM.",0
1788,"OBJECTIVE: Contact tracing is a central public health response to infectious disease outbreaks, especially in the early stages of an outbreak when specific treatments are limited. Importation of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and elsewhere into the UK highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. DESIGN: Detailed survey information on social encounters from over 5800 respondents is coupled to predictive models of contact tracing and control. This is used to investigate the likely efficacy of contact tracing and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. RESULTS: Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission we predict that under effective contact tracing less than 1 in 6 cases will generate any subsequent untraced infections, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36 individuals traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we find that tracing using a contact definition requiring more than 4 hours of contact is unlikely to control spread. CONCLUSIONS: The current contact tracing strategy within the UK is likely to identify a sufficient proportion of infected individuals such that subsequent spread could be prevented, although the ultimate success will depend on the rapid detection of cases and isolation of contacts. Given the burden of tracing a large number of contacts to find new cases, there is the potential the system could be overwhelmed if imports of infection occur at a rapid rate.",0
1789,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unlike anything seen before by modern science-based medicine. Health systems across the world are struggling to manage it. Added to this struggle are the effects of social confinement and isolation. This brings into question whether the latest guidelines are relevant in this crisis. We aim to support urologists in this difficult situation by providing tools that can facilitate decision making, and to minimise the impact and risks for both patients and health professionals delivering urological care, whenever possible. We hope that the revised recommendations will assist urologist surgeons across the globe to guide the management of urological conditions during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",0
1790,"Importance: Data from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the US show large differences in hospitalizations and mortality across race and geography. However, there are limited data on health information, beliefs, and behaviors that might indicate different exposure to risk. Objective: To determine the association of sociodemographic characteristics with reported incidence, knowledge, and behavior regarding COVID-19 among US adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: A US national survey study was conducted from March 29 to April 13, 2020, to measure differences in knowledge, beliefs, and behavior about COVID-19. The survey oversampled COVID-19 hotspot areas. The survey was conducted electronically. The criteria for inclusion were age 18 years or older and residence in the US. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were incidence, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19 as measured by survey response. Results: The survey included 5198 individuals (mean [SD] age, 48 [18] years; 2336 men [45%]; 3759 white [72%], 830 [16%] African American, and 609 [12%] Hispanic). The largest differences in COVID-19-related knowledge and behaviors were associated with race/ethnicity, sex, and age, with African American participants, men, and people younger than 55 years showing less knowledge than other groups. African American respondents were 3.5 percentage points (95% CI, 1.5 to 5.5 percentage points; P = .001) more likely than white respondents to report being infected with COVID-19, as were men compared with women (3.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.0 to 4.4 percentage points; P < .001). Knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19 was more common among African American respondents (7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.4 to 10.9 percentage points; P < .001), people younger than 30 years (11.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.5 to 15.7 percentage points; P < .001), and people with higher incomes (coefficient on earning ≥$100 000, 12.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.7 to 15.8 percentage points; P < .001). Knowledge of potential fomite spread was lower among African American respondents (-9.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -13.1 to -5.7 percentage points; P < .001), Hispanic respondents (-4.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.9 to -0.77 percentage points; P = .02), and people younger than 30 years (-10.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -14.1 to -6.5 percentage points; P < .001). Similar gaps were found with respect to knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and preventive behaviors. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, there were gaps in reported incidence of COVID-19 and knowledge regarding its spread and symptoms and social distancing behavior. More effort is needed to increase accurate information and encourage appropriate behaviors among minority communities, men, and younger people.",0
1791,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, most Canadian provinces have gone through four distinct phases of social distancing and enhanced testing. A transmission dynamics model fitted to the cumulative case time series data permits us to estimate the effectiveness of interventions implemented in terms of the contact rate, probability of transmission per contact, proportion of isolated contacts, and detection rate. This allows us to calculate the control reproduction number during different phases (which gradually decreased to less than one). From this, we derive the necessary conditions in terms of enhanced social distancing, personal protection, contact tracing, quarantine/isolation strength at each escalation phase for the disease control to avoid a rebound. From this, we quantify the conditions needed to prevent epidemic rebound during de-escalation by simply reversing the escalation process.",0
1792,"The COVID-19 started from Wuhan city in China, slowly spread across the globe after December 2019. Due to movement of people from one city to other cities, one country to other countries, infection spreads and COVID-19 became a pandemic. Efforts were made at local, regional and national levels to lockdown the movement of people and to keep infected one in quarantine or isolation to stop the spread of COVID-19. The traffic, market and small industries were closed, as a result pronounced decline in the concentrations of particulate matters (PM) were observed. Normally these sources contribute to the high concentrations of particulate matters (PM2.5) which represents air quality of a location. In this short communication, we present analysis of PM2.5 of major cities (New York, Los Angeles, Zaragoza, Rome, Dubai, Delhi, Mumbai, Beijing and Shanghai) around the world suffered severely with the COVID-19. Our analysis shows decline in PM2.5 concentration due to lockdown, mainly due to less movement of people to keep ""social distancing"" to control the spread of CORONA-19. The low concentrations of PM2.5 reflect the efforts made in the cities to curb the spread of infection, that improve air quality.",0

1794,"BackgroundCOVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in China and subsequently developed into an ongoing epidemic. Understanding epidemiological factors characterising the transmission dynamics of this disease is of fundamental importance.AimsThis study aimed to describe key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 in Hong Kong.MethodsWe extracted data of confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts from the publicly available information released by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection. We used doubly interval censored likelihood to estimate containment delay and serial interval, by fitting gamma, lognormal and Weibull distributions to respective empirical values using Bayesian framework with right truncation. A generalised linear regression model was employed to identify factors associated with containment delay. Secondary attack rate was also estimated.ResultsThe empirical containment delay was 6.39 days; whereas after adjusting for right truncation with the best-fit Weibull distribution, it was 10.4 days (95% CrI: 7.15 to 19.81). Containment delay increased significantly over time. Local source of infection and number of doctor consultations before isolation were associated with longer containment delay. The empirical serial interval was 4.58-6.06 days; whereas the best-fit lognormal distribution to 26 certain-and-probable infector-infectee paired data gave an estimate of 4.77 days (95% CrI: 3.47 to 6.90) with right-truncation. The secondary attack rate among close contacts was 11.7%.ConclusionWith a considerable containment delay and short serial interval, contact-tracing effectiveness may not be optimised to halt the transmission with rapid generations replacement. Our study highlights the transmission risk of social interaction and pivotal role of physical distancing in suppressing the epidemic.",0
1795,"This cross-sectional study aimed to characterize the lifestyle habits, anxiety levels and basic psychological needs (BPN), in Portuguese adults during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including a comparison between genders and age groups. In total, 1404 adults (36.4 ± 11.7 years; 69.6% female) answered sociodemographic data and three instruments: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, the Basic Need General Satisfaction Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Males revealed higher values for the total energy expenditure (z = -2.26; p = 0.024; η 2 = 0.004) and for the level of satisfaction of competence (z = -2.62; p = 0.009; η 2 = 0.005). Females showed higher scores for the anxiety state (z = -7.87; p ≤ 0.001; η 2 = 0.044) and anxiety trait (z = -6.49; p ≤ 0.001; η 2 = 0.030). Regarding age, higher values for the anxiety trait (p ≤ 0.001; η H 2 = 0.030) were found in the 18-34 years-old group compared to all the other age groups, also presenting significantly higher values of total energy expenditure (χ² = 13.93; p = 0.008; η H 2 = 0.007) when compared to the 35-44 years-old group. Significant differences were observed between the 18-34 years-old group and the other age groups for the satisfaction of competence (χ² = 40.97; p ≤ 0.001; η H 2 = 0.026), except for the >65 years-old group. Strategies for promoting well-being during periods of social isolation should consider the role of psychological dimensions and lifestyle habits according to the gender or age group.",0
1796,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. METHODS: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across China. The model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. RESULTS: We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, R2=0.86) with reported incidence. Without NPIs, the number of COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 - 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. If NPIs could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across China, respectively. Results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on February 17, 2020. CONCLUSION: The NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World.",0
1797,"BACKGROUND: Practitioners and researchers in the midst of overwhelming coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks are calling for new ways of looking at such pandemics, with an emphasis on human behavior and holistic considerations. Viral outbreaks are characterized by socio-behaviorally-oriented public health efforts aimed at reducing exposure and prevention of morbidity/mortality once infected. These efforts involve different points-of-view, generally, than do those aimed to understand the virus' natural history. Rampant spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cities clearly signals that urban areas contain conditions favorable for rapid transmission of the virus. MAIN TEXT: The Critical Medical Ecology model is a multidimensional, multilevel way of viewing pandemics comprehensively, rooted simultaneously in microbiology and in anthropology, with shared priority for evolution, context, stressors, homeostasis, adaptation, and power relationships. Viewing COVID-19 with a Critical Medical Ecological lens suggests three important interpretations: 1) COVID-19 is equally - if not more - a socially-driven disease as much as a biomedical disease, 2) the present interventions available for primary prevention of transmission are social and behavioral interventions, and 3) wide variation in COVID-19 hospitalization/death rates is not expected to significantly be attributable to a more virulent and rapidly-evolving virus, but rather to differences in social and behavioral factors - and power dynamics - rather than (solely) biological and clinical factors. Cities especially are challenged due to logistics and volume of patients, and lack of access to sustaining products and services for many residents living in isolation. CONCLUSIONS: In the end, SARS-CoV-2 is acting upon dynamic social human beings, entangled within structures and relationships that include but extend far beyond their cells, and in fact beyond their own individual behavior. As a comprehensive way of thinking, the Critical Medical Ecology model helps identify these elements and dynamics in the context of ecological processes that create, shape, and sustain people in their multidimensional, intersecting environments.",0
1798,"BACKGROUND: Throughout March 2020, leaders in countries across the globe were making crucial decisions about how and when to implement public health interventions to combat COVID-19. They urgently needed tools to help them to explore what will work best in their specific circumstances of epidemic size and spread and feasible intervention scenarios. OBJECTIVE: We sought to rapidly develop a flexible, freely available simulation model for use by modellers and researchers to allow investigation of how various public health interventions implemented at various time points might change the shape of the COVID-19 epidemic curve. METHODS: ""COVOID"" (COVID-19 Open-source Infection Dynamics) is a stochastic individual contact model (ICM), which extends the ICMs provided by the open-source EpiModel package for the R statistical computing environment. To demonstrate its use and inform urgent decisions as at 30 March 2020, we modelled similar intervention scenarios to those reported by other investigators using various model types, as well as novel scenarios. The scenarios involved isolation of cases, moderate social distancing and stricter population ""lock-downs"" enacted over varying time periods, in a hypothetical population of 100,000 people. On 30 April 2020, we simulated the epidemic curve for the three contiguous local areas (population 287,344) in eastern Sydney, Australia, that recorded 5.3% of Australian cases of COVID-19 through to 30 April 2020, under five different intervention scenarios, and compared the modelled predictions with the observed epidemic curve for these areas. RESULTS: COVOID allocates each member of a population to one of seven compartments. The number of times individuals in the various compartments interact with each other and their probability of transmitting infection at each interaction can be varied to simulate the effects of interventions. Using COVOID on 30 March 2020, we were able to replicate the epidemic response patterns to specific social distancing intervention scenarios reported by others. The simulated curve for three local areas of Sydney from 1 March to 30 April 2020 was similar to the observed epidemic curve, in terms of peak numbers of cases, total numbers of cases and duration, under a scenario representing the public health measures that were actually enacted, including case isolation and ramp-up of testing and social distancing measures. CONCLUSIONS: COVOID allows rapid modelling of many potential intervention scenarios, can be tailored to diverse settings and requires only standard computing infrastructure. It replicates the epidemic curves produced by other models that require highly detailed population-level data, and its predicted epidemic curve, using parameters simulating the public health measures that were enacted, was similar in form to that actually observed in Sydney, Australia. Our team and collaborators are currently developing an extended open-source COVOID package comprising a suite of tools to explore intervention scenarios using several categories of model.

1799,"BACKGROUND: Although attention is focused on addressing the acute situation created by the COVID-19 illness, it is imperative to continue our efforts to prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly during a period of prolonged social isolation which may limit physical activity, adversely affect mental health and reduce access to usual care. One option may be to deliver healthcare interventions remotely through digital healthcare solutions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to bring together the evidence for remote healthcare during a quarantine situation period to support people living with cardiovascular disease during COVID-19 isolation. METHODS: The PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched using telehealth OR digital health OR mHealth OR eHealth OR mobile apps AND COVID-19 OR quarantine search terms. We also searched for literature relating to cardiovascular disease AND quarantine. RESULTS: The literature search identified 45 potentially relevant publications, out of which nine articles were included. Three overarching themes emerged from this review: (1) preparing the workforce and ensuring reimbursement for remote healthcare, (2) supporting mental and physical health and (3) supporting usual care. CONCLUSION: To support people living with cardiovascular disease during COVID-19 isolation and to mitigate the effects of quarantine and adverse effect on mental and physical well-being, we should offer remote healthcare and provide access to their usual care.",0
1800,"BACKGROUND: With the sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction test used to detect the presence of the virus in the human host, the worldwide health community has been able to record a large number of the recovered population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the probability of reinfection in the recovered class and the model equations, which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium state for the coronavirus disease. METHODS: The model differential equation was evaluated for the disease-free equilibrium for the case of reinfection as well as the existence and stability criteria for the disease, using the model proportions. This evaluation shows that the criteria for a local or worldwide asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number (R0=0) were satisfied. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population, as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes (ie, B=0). RESULTS: With a total of about 900,000 infected cases worldwide, numerical simulations for this study were carried out to complement the analytical results and investigate the effect that the implementation of quarantine and observation procedures has on the projection of further virus spread. CONCLUSIONS: As shown by the results, the proportion of the infected population, in the absence of a curative vaccination, will continue to grow worldwide; meanwhile, the recovery rate will continue slowly, which means that the ratio of infection rate to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded. Most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population, which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.",0
1802,"In December 2019 a novel viral respiratory pathogen emerged in China, ultimately named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Co-V-2) with the clinical illness dubbed coronavirus disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 became a global pandemic in early 2020 forcing governments worldwide to enact social isolation policies with dire economic ramifications. Emergency departments (ED) encountered decreased patient volumes before some in Seattle, New York City, New Orleans, and Detroit experienced waves of COVID-19 patients mixed with asymptomatic patients or those concerned about potential exposures. Diagnosing COVID-19 was hampered by inadequate supplies of reagents and kits, which was compounded by clinical and radiographic features that overlap with numerous seasonal viral respiratory infections.",0
1803,"BACKGROUND: The global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) began in December 2019. The high levels of stress experienced by nurses during this pandemic may have immediate and long-term effects on their mental health. PURPOSE: To explore the stress and psychological problems of nurses during this pandemic and to identify strategies used by these nurses to relieve stress. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted that included a basic information datasheet, stress of nursing staff during COVID-19 outbreak scale, psychological distress scale, and stress relief methods survey form. Convenience sampling was used and a total of 469 practicing nurses participated in this study. RESULTS: Most of the participants expressed concerns about living problems (72.7%). On the stress questionnaire, the facets of ""burden of taking care of patients"" and ""worries about social isolation"" earned the first and second highest scores, respectively. In terms of items, ""worrying about infecting family members and friends"" and ""worrying about being separated from family after being infected"" earned the two highest scores (2.35 ± 0.79 and 2.17 ± 0.92, respectively). Scores for psychological distress averaged 5.49 ± 3.83, with stress anxiety (1.32 ± 0.84) earning the highest mean subscale score followed by distress and irritability (1.17 ± 0.92) and depression (1.12 ± 0.94). Nearly two-thirds (61.8%) of the participants earned psychological and emotional distress scores within the 'normal' range, and 3.4% earned scores indicating severe distress. ""Receiving education and training"" was the most common method used by the participants to relieve stress (2.27 ± 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: The following six strategies are proposed based on the above findings: (1) Caring: provide psychological assessment and care; (2) Supporting: create a friendly team atmosphere and provide support; (3) Inquiring: recruit volunteers with relevant experience; (4) Informing: provide timely, open, and transparent epidemic-prevention information; (5) Equipping: provide complete and appropriate epidemic-prevention education and training; (6) Assisting: establish a strategy for family support and caring to reduce the stress and worries of nurses.",0
1804,"The lockdown of the country, imposed by the government of India, has resulted in additional suffering for the poor without any tangible benefit. The germ theory of disease is an important contribution to human welfare. However, disease has social determinants. Responses to infectious epidemics should be based on social conditions, not only from considerations of equity, but also because they are important for success. Advice from the World Health Organisation has to be tailored to the social realities in India. Current response by the government of India has confined the poor to ghettos. They have lost the means of livelihood without a proper social security net. It is not possible for them to practise social distancing or proper hygiene. The lockdown has the effect of making conditions worse for the poor.

1805,"To forecast the COVID-19 epidemic trend in Iran, a set of dynamic models were created. In these models, the effect of climate and community behavior change on the reproductive number is modeled. A baseline scenario is also defined as letting the epidemic grow naturally, with no prevention/control interventions. Different levels of intervention are also defined based on the extent of population isolation. Outcomes of each scenario on the number of infected cases are computed. Modeling results shows that if effective isolation occurs in 10% of the population, 307,000 individuals will be infected with COVID-19 in Iran by May 20, 2020. For an isolation rate of 25%, started since March 10, 2020, cumulative number of deaths will be 13,450 individuals by May 20, 2020. If preventive efforts can reach a 32% effective isolation rate, a considerable decrease in the number of new cases would be expected during April and May, and the total number of deaths would decrease to 8,630. If the isolation rate increases to 40%, the total number of infected individuals is expected to be 6,030 individuals. It should be acknowledged that this model predicts the number of deaths of all COVID-19 cases, including those who will not be confirmed as COVID-19, because of non-testing or death prior to COVID-19 identification. This serious health issue requires both long-term and short-term planning and arrangements. Social distancing, and identification and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases are believed to be the most important and effective control measure, and should be strengthened soon.

1806,"At the end of 2019, a new form of pneumonia disease known as the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly spread throughout most provinces of China, and the total global number of COVID-19 cases has surpassed 500 000 by Mar. 27, 2020 (WHO, 2020). On Jan. 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global health emergency (WHO, 2020). COVID-19 causes most damage to the respiratory system, leading to pneumonia or breathing difficulties. The confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) was estimated to be 5% to 8% (Jung et al., 2020). Besides physical pain, COVID-19 also induces psychological distress, with depression, anxiety, and stress affecting the general population, quarantined population, medical staff, and patients at different levels (Kang et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2020). Previous research on patients in isolation wards highlighted the risk of depressed mood, fear, loneliness, frustration, excessive worries, and insomnia (Abad et al., 2010).",0
1807,"New York City is currently experiencing an outbreak of COVID-19, a highly contagious and potentially deadly virus, which is particularly dangerous for older adults. This pandemic has led to public health policies including social distancing and stay-at-home orders. We explore here the impact of this unique crisis on victims of elder mistreatment and people at risk of victimization. The COVID-19 outbreak has also had a profound impact on the organizations from many sectors that typically respond to protect and serve victims of elder mistreatment. We examine this impact and describe creative solutions developed by these organizations and initial lessons learned in New York City to help inform other communities facing this pandemic and provide guidance for future crises.",0
1809,"OBJECTIVES: A large number of healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. METHODS: We collected 626 surface swabs within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020. Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major PPE. The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%). We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. The most contaminated objects were self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were the most contaminated PPE. CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19.",0
1810,"Laboratory medicine provides an almost irreplaceable contribution to the diagnostic reasoning and managed care of most human pathologies. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not an exception to this paradigm. Although the relatively recent emergence does not allow to draw definitive conclusions on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostics, some standpoints can be conveyed. First and foremost, it seems now clear that we will be living together with this virus for quite a long time, so that our vigilance and responsiveness against the emergence of new local outbreaks shall be maintained at the highest possible levels. The etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, deeply based on direct identification of viral RNA by means of molecular biology techniques in biological materials, especially upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Whether other materials, such as blood, urine, stools, saliva and throat washing, will become valid alternatives has not been unequivocally defined so far. As concerns serological testing, promising information can be garnered from preliminary investigations, showing that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients seem to develop a sustained immune response against the virus, characterized especially by emergence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA, 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Whether these antibodies will have persistent neutralizing activity against the virus is still to be elucidated on individual and general basis. The availability of rapid tests for detecting either viral antigens or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a potentially viable opportunity for purposes of epidemiologic surveillance, though more information is needed on accuracy and reliability of these portable immunoassays.",0
1811,"In December 2019, novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and spread rapidly across the country. In the early stages of the epidemic, China adopted the containment strategy and implemented a series of core measures around this strategic point, including social mobilization, strengthening case isolation and close contacts tracking management, blocking epidemic areas and traffic control to reduce personnel movements and increase social distance, environmental measures and personal protection, with a view to controlling the epidemic as soon as possible in limited areas such as Wuhan. This article summarizes the background, key points and core measures in the country and provinces. It sent prospects for future prevention and control strategies.",0
1812,"Clinical evaluation should guide those needing immediate investigation. Strict adherence to COVID-19 protection measures is necessary. Alternative ways of consultations (telephone, video) should be used. Early discussion with regional/national experts about investigation and management of potential and existing patients is strongly encouraged. Patients with moderate or severe clinical features need urgent investigation and management. Patients with active Cushing's syndrome, especially when severe, are immunocompromised and vigorous adherence to the principles of social isolation is recommended. In patients with mild features or in whom a diagnosis is less likely, clinical re-evaluation should be repeated at 3 and 6 months or deferred until the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly decreased; however, those individuals should be encouraged to maintain social distancing. Diagnostic pathways may need to be very different from usual recommendations in order to reduce possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2. When extensive differential diagnostic testing and/or surgery is not feasible, it should be deferred and medical treatment should be initiated. Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery should be delayed during high SARS-CoV-2 viral prevalence. Medical management rather than surgery will be the used for most patients, since the short- to mid-term prognosis depends in most cases on hypercortisolism rather than its cause; it should be initiated promptly to minimize the risk of infection in these immunosuppressed patients. The risk/benefit ratio of these recommendations will need re-evaluation every 2-3 months from April 2020 in each country (and possibly local areas) and will depend on the local health care structure and phase of pandemic.",0
1813,"In the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area, where the first case of novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in the United States was reported (1), a community-level outbreak is ongoing with evidence of rapid spread and high morbidity and mortality among older adults in long-term care skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) (2,3). However, COVID-19 morbidity among residents of senior independent and assisted living communities, in which residents do not live as closely together as do residents in SNFs and do not require skilled nursing services, has not been described. During March 5-9, 2020, two residents of a senior independent and assisted living community in Seattle (facility 1) were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection; on March 6, social distancing and other preventive measures were implemented in the community. UW Medicine (the health system linked to the University of Washington), Public Health - Seattle & King County, and CDC conducted an investigation at the facility. On March 10, all residents and staff members at facility 1 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and asked to complete a questionnaire about their symptoms; all residents were tested again 7 days later. Among 142 residents and staff members tested during the initial phase, three of 80 residents (3.8%) and two of 62 staff members (3.2%) had positive test results. The three residents had no symptoms at the time of testing, although one reported an earlier cough that had resolved. A fourth resident, who had negative test results in the initial phase, had positive test results 7 days later. This resident was asymptomatic on both days. Possible explanations for so few cases of COVID-19 in this residential community compared with those in several Seattle SNFs with high morbidity and mortality include more social distancing among residents and less contact with health care providers. In addition, early implementation of stringent isolation and protective measures after identification of two COVID-19 cases might have been effective in minimizing spread of the virus in this type of setting. When investigating a potential outbreak of COVID-19 in senior independent and assisted living communities, symptom screening is unlikely to be sufficient to identify all persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. Adherence to CDC guidance to prevent COVID-19 transmission in senior independent and assisted living communities (4) could be instrumental in preventing a facility outbreak.",0
1814,"BACKGROUND: Public health recommendations and governmental measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in numerous restrictions on daily living including social distancing, isolation and home confinement. While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours. METHODS: Following a structured review of the literature, the ""Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)"" Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform. Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses ""before"" and ""during"" confinement conditions. RESULTS: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day. Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly. CONCLUSION: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction. A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.",0
1815,"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic1. The outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective2, but quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of NPIs and their timings3. Using epidemiological and anonymised human movement data4,5, here we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China. We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020. Without NPIs, the COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (interquartile range 44 - 94) by February 29, 2020, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to have prevented more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but combined NPIs achieved the strongest and most rapid effect. The lifting of travel restrictions since February 17, 2020 does not appear to lead to an increase in cases across China if the social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of 25% reduction on average through late April. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of NPIs on COVID-19 and to inform response efforts across the World.",0
1818,"Residents in long-term care facilities (LTCF) are a vulnerable population group. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related deaths in LTCF residents represent 30-60% of all COVID-19 deaths in many European countries.

1819,"On March 17, 2020, a member of a Skagit County, Washington, choir informed Skagit County Public Health (SCPH) that several members of the 122-member choir had become ill. Three persons, two from Skagit County and one from another area, had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Another 25 persons had compatible symptoms. SCPH obtained the choir's member list and began an investigation on March 18. Among 61 persons who attended a March 10 choir practice at which one person was known to be symptomatic, 53 cases were identified, including 33 confirmed and 20 probable cases (secondary attack rates of 53.3% among confirmed cases and 86.7% among all cases). Three of the 53 persons who became ill were hospitalized (5.7%), and two died (3.7%). The 2.5-hour singing practice provided several opportunities for droplet and fomite transmission, including members sitting close to one another, sharing snacks, and stacking chairs at the end of the practice. The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization (1). Certain persons, known as superemitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events (2-5). These data demonstrate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of superemitters contributing to broad transmission in certain unique activities and circumstances. It is recommended that persons avoid face-to-face contact with others, not gather in groups, avoid crowded places, maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet to reduce transmission, and wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.",0
1820,"During the rapid rise in COVID-19 illnesses and deaths globally, and notwithstanding recommended precautions, questions are voiced about routes of transmission for this pandemic disease. Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.",0
1821,": The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to worsen mental health problems in the general population, including increasing engagement in addictive behaviors. Here, we describe observations suggesting that the current crisis and its sequelae may worsen problem gambling. The current pandemic may impact financial and psychological well-being due to social isolation during spatial distancing, and these stressors in conjunction with substantial changes in gambling markets (land-based, online) during the pandemic may significantly influence gambling behaviors. This situation calls for rapid research initiatives in this area and preventive and regulatory measures by multiple stakeholders.",0
1822,"Background: Ending the COVID-19 pandemic is arguably one of the most prominent challenges in recent human history. Following closely the growth dynamics of the disease is one of the pillars toward achieving that goal. Objective: We aimed at developing a simple framework to facilitate the analysis of the growth rate (cases/day) and growth acceleration (cases/day2) of COVID-19 cases in real-time. Methods: The framework was built using the Moving Regression (MR) technique and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The dynamics of the pandemic was initially modeled via combinations of four different growth stages: lagging (beginning of the outbreak), exponential (rapid growth), deceleration (growth decay), and stationary (near zero growth). A fifth growth behavior, namely linear growth (constant growth above zero), was further introduced to add more flexibility to the framework. An R Shiny application was developed, which can be accessed at https://theguarani.com.br/ or downloaded from https://github.com/adamtaiti/SARS-CoV-2. The framework was applied to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which comprised 3,722,128 cases reported worldwide as of May 8th 2020. Results: We found that the impact of public health measures on the prevalence of COVID-19 could be perceived in seemingly real-time by monitoring growth acceleration curves. Restriction to human mobility produced detectable decline in growth acceleration within 1 week, deceleration within ~2 weeks and near-stationary growth within ~6 weeks. Countries exhibiting different permutations of the five growth stages indicated that the evolution of COVID-19 prevalence is more complex and dynamic than previously appreciated. Conclusions: These results corroborate that mass social isolation is a highly effective measure against the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, as previously suggested. Apart from the analysis of prevalence partitioned by country, the proposed framework is easily applicable to city, state, region and arbitrary territory data, serving as an asset to monitor the local behavior of COVID-19 cases.",0
1823,"BACKGROUND: With the World Health Organization's pandemic declaration and government-initiated actions against coronavirus disease (COVID-19), sentiments surrounding COVID-19 have evolved rapidly. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine worldwide trends of four emotions-fear, anger, sadness, and joy-and the narratives underlying those emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Over 20 million social media twitter posts made during the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak from January 28 to April 9, 2020, were collected using ""wuhan,"" ""corona,"" ""nCov,"" and ""covid"" as search keywords. RESULTS: Public emotions shifted strongly from fear to anger over the course of the pandemic, while sadness and joy also surfaced. Findings from word clouds suggest that fears around shortages of COVID-19 tests and medical supplies became increasingly widespread discussion points. Anger shifted from xenophobia at the beginning of the pandemic to discourse around the stay-at-home notices. Sadness was highlighted by the topics of losing friends and family members, while topics related to joy included words of gratitude and good health. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, global COVID-19 sentiments have shown rapid evolutions within just the span of a few weeks. Findings suggest that emotion-driven collective issues around shared public distress experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic are developing and include large-scale social isolation and the loss of human lives. The steady rise of societal concerns indicated by negative emotions needs to be monitored and controlled by complementing regular crisis communication with strategic public health communication that aims to balance public psychological wellbeing.",0
1824,"In December 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China causing many cases of severe pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named this disease Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The infection has rapidly spread across China to many other countries, and on March 12, 2020 the WHO declared pandemic outbreak of COVID-19. As of May 16, 2020, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 4,490,000 patients, associated to 305,976 deaths worldwide; in Italy 224,760 COVID-19 cases have been reported with 31,763 deaths. The main routes of transmission are respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people, so numerous prevention strategies are employed to mitigate the spread of disease, including social distancing and isolation. The aim of this narrative review is to underline gender differences in epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Currently data on the sex indicators for admitted or deceased patients are only available, but there is no analysis about other gender indicators. The data considered in our study are the only currently available in the literature, but it is appropriate to implement a specific analysis with all gender indicators to identify appropriate strategies. Moreover, the evaluation of a health service efficiency is a key element to define gender outcomes. Knowing the gender differences in COVID-19 outbreak would be a fundamental tool to understand the effects of a health emergency on individuals and communities as well as to carry out effective and equitable policies, public health measures and targeted solutions.",0
1826,"As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, an increasing number of countries and territories are adopting restrictive measures based on physical (""social"") distancing, aimed at preventing human-to-human transmission and thereby limiting virus propagation. Nationwide lockdowns, encompassing mass quarantine under stay-at-home ordinances, have already been proven effective to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in some countries. Nevertheless, a prolonged homestay may also be associated with potential side effects, which may jeopardize people's health and thus must be recognized and mitigated in a way without violating local ordinances. Some of the most important undesirable consequences of prolonged homestay such as physical inactivity, weight gain, behavioral addiction disorders, insufficient sunlight exposure and social isolation will be critically addressed in this article, which also aims to provide some tentative recommendations for the alleviation of side effects.",0
1827,"The global emergency caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has suddenly changed how we communicate with families in all the CoViD-19 care settings, due to the obligation to maintain complete social isolation. Healthcare workers are isolated from their families, and must manage the consequences of this isolation just like the patients. They and their families perceive the personal attitudes, closeness and psychological support from the care teams. This perception of genuine participation by the healthcare workers during isolation is especially important when a patient dies, and it may influence the process of grief. This document is intended for all healthcare professionals caring for CoViD-19 patients, particularly those in more severe clinical conditions and it is aimed to help the care team to communicate with families distanced from the patient. The document consists of three parts: 1) presentation of the statements for communicating with patients family members during isolation; 2) discussion of key points as a theoretical framework for the statements; 3) instructions for telephone communication, with a checklist and a worksheet. The document was written by authors from different disciplines (doctors, nurses, psychologists, legal experts) and was then reviewed by a group of experts comprising professionals, people who have experienced ICU hospitalization, and their families. Finally, the document was approved by the National Boards of the Italian Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care (SIAARTI), Italian Association of Critical Care Nurses (Aniarti), Italian Society of Emergency Medicine (SIMEU), and Italian Society of Palliative Care (SICP).",0
1829,"One of the main challenges of the measures against the COVID-19 epidemic is to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak without increasing without control its timescale. We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic dynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak IP can be achieved only at the price of increasing the time tP of its occurrence and its entire time-span tE . By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the equations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale and the speed of the epidemics, by reducing the infection rate α and by increasing the removal rate β by a factor of λ. We show that for a given value of the size (IP , the total, IE and average                                                                                        I                                 ^                                                          P                                               number of infected), its occurrence time tP and entire time-span tE can be reduced by a factor 1/λ if the reduction of I is achieved by increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. Thus, epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on social distancing. We apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy. We show that the peak time tP and the entire time span tE could have been reduced by a factor 0.9 ≤ 1/λ ≤ 0.34 with containment measures focused on increasing β instead of reducing α.",0
1830,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created major insecurities regarding whether we can and should maintain the current standards of diagnosis and treatment and access to care for patients with cancer. This is particularly true in the field of neuro-oncology, where the perceived benefit of therapeutic interventions is often low, although this notion is partially incorrect. We acknowledge that the recommendations for care of patients with cancer have become a moving target and that all recommendations are subject to modification based on national and institutional regulations. Still, some important considerations and proposals may apply broadly. First, it is important to note that old age and cardiovascular and pulmonary co-morbidities are the major risk factors for experiencing a severe course of and for dying of COVID-19, not chronic immunosuppression and cancer. Second, many of the considerations on how we should adapt clinical practice in neuro-oncology in view of COVID-19 that are now dominating discussions at local tumour boards, as well as on the institutional level and within societies of neuro-oncology, are not novel but have been valid before and only now have become a priority. More than ever, it seems to be mandatory to adhere to evidence-based medicine and not to prescribe potentially toxic, notably immunsuppresssive systemic therapy where evidence for efficacy is low. Furthermore, it is more obvious now that oncologists must not miss the right time for advance care planning, that is, supporting patients in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals and preferences regarding future medical care. The major psychological impact of transforming oncology care to teleconferences and videoconferences and of the important strict recommendation of social distancing must not be overlooked in a patient population that is characterised by significant prevalence of cognitive decline and by the general perception that their life span may not exceed the life span of the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
1831,"BACKGROUND: A range of public health measures have been implemented to suppress local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong. We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. METHODS: We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time. Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20-23, Feb 11-14, and March 10-13, 2020. FINDINGS: COVID-19 transmissibility measured by Rt has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34-53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated Rt of 1·28 (95% CI 1·26-1·30) before the start of the school closures to 0·72 (0·70-0·74) during the closure weeks. Similarly, a 33% (24-43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an Rt of 1·10 (1·06-1·12) before the start of the school closures to 0·73 (0·68-0·77) after school closures. Among respondents to the surveys, 74·5%, 97·5%, and 98·8% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61·3%, 90·2%, and 85·1% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively. INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

1834,"BACKGROUND: According to UNESCO's monitoring, more than 160 countries implemented nationwide closures, which impacted over 87% of the world's student population. Several other countries implemented localized school closures; should these closures become nationwide, millions of additional learners will experience education disruption. Universities from around the world have been uncertain about how long the coronavirus crisis will last and how it might affect the mental health of students and faculty. The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. METHOD: The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. RESULTS: By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health - these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest. For instance, loneliness, which will increase under these circumstances, seems to have a negative impact on education and, therefore, on psychological pain and suffering.",0
1835,"Anosmia and hypogeusia, the inability or decreased ability to smell and taste, have been reported as common complaints in SARS-CoV-2 patients who were still in an asymptomatic phase. These impairments affect the ability to sense odors in foods and the environment, obviously affecting quality of life, related to social interactions and general well-being. The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology (ENT-UK) considers loss of sense of smell in their list of COVID-19's markers of infection. Here we present two cases in which early manifestations of anosmia and hypogeusia were experienced with psycho-sensorial and atmospheric phenomena. Psychiatrists, neurologists and physicians in general should be aware of this symptom presentation in order to avoid mistreatment, given that persistent olfactory dysfunction might increase the risks of nutritional deficit and lead to development of adjustment disorders. All clinicians should be aware that the presentation of SARS-CoV-2's symptoms goes far beyond respiratory and sensorial dimensions and involves psychosensorial and neurological dimensions; these clinical observations could shed light on the neurobiological substrates involved in COVID-19 disease.",0
1836,"A novel infectious disease, Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19), spread globally since Dec. 2019. Without effective treatment and vaccination, the strategies to restrain this disease is only keeping social distance, maintaining personal hygiene, quarantine and isolation. However, thrice-a-week treatment is inevitable for all hemodialysis patients. In addition to the high risk of cluster infection and compromised immunity in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), an atypical disease presentation could also make the medial system neglect these patients during CVOID-19 pandemic. To avoid COVID-19 transmission among dialysis patients, the major societies of nephrology around the world have provided their guidelines of screening, dialysis facilities adjustment, and health education, respectively. In this review, we summarized the main contents and difference of these guidelines and addressed the prompt management for ESRD patients to reduce the risk of infection during COVID-19 pandemic.",0
1838,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: With social distancing measures in place both nationally and globally, the current COVID-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of in-person classes at universities and medical schools across the country. This has presented unique challenges for educators in all fields as they have embarked, many for the first time, on the journey into remote education in order to provide distance learning opportunities for students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this article we will review our approach to rapidly converting an in-person diagnostic radiology elective to an entirely remote learning experience for medical students at our institution, including modification of course structure, software tools and materials utilized, and strategies for learner engagement and collaboration. RESULTS: Development of an online elective led to a 10-fold increase in student enrollment compared to the traditional course offering, providing a unique opportunity to reach a broad number of students, many of whom were in the early clinical stages of their medical school career. Lastly, we will review faculty feedback after participating in the remote course as well as lessons learned from the transition to distance learning and its implications for future work CONCLUSION: The current state of technology makes radiology particularly well-suited for distance learning, and with the proper tools and approaches, effective remote radiology instruction can be achieved.",0
1839,"BACKGROUND: South Korea took preemptive action against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by implementing extensive testing, thorough epidemiological investigation, strict social distancing, and rapid treatment of patients according to disease severity. The Korean government entrusted large-scale hospitals with the operation of living and treatment support centers (LTSCs) for the management for clinically healthy COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to introduce our experience implementing information and communications technology (ICT)-based remote patient management systems at a COVID-19 LTSC. METHODS: We adopted new electronic health record templates, hospital information system (HIS) dashboards, cloud-based medical image sharing, a mobile app, and smart vital sign monitoring devices. RESULTS: Enhancements were made to the HIS to assist in the workflow and care of patients in the LTSC. A dashboard was created for the medical staff to view the vital signs and symptoms of all patients. Patients used a mobile app to consult with their physician or nurse, answer questionnaires, and input self-measured vital signs; the results were uploaded to the hospital information system in real time. Cloud-based image sharing enabled interoperability between medical institutions. Korea's strategy of aggressive mitigation has ""flattened the curve"" of the rate of infection. A multidisciplinary approach was integral to develop systems supporting patient care and management at the living and treatment support center as quickly as possible. CONCLUSIONS: Faced with a novel infectious disease, we describe the implementation and experience of applying an ICT-based patient management system in the LTSC affiliated with Seoul National University Hospital. ICT-based tools and applications are increasingly important in health care, and we hope that our experience will provide insight into future technology-based infectious disease responses.",0

1842,"To reduce the spread of COVID-19, the World Health Organization and the majority of governments have recommended that the entire human population should 'stay-at-home'. A significant proportion of the population live alone or are vulnerable to mental health problems yet, in the vast majority of cases, individuals in social isolation have no access to mental healthcare. The only resource is people themselves using self-help, self-medication and self-care. During prolonged COVID-19 isolation, an in-built system of homeostasis can help rebalance activity, thought and feeling. Increased physical activity enables a reset of physical and mental well-being. During periods of lockdown, it is recommended that exercise should be as vigorously promoted as social distancing itself.",0

1844,"OBJECTIVE: Contagious disease outbreaks and related restrictions can lead to negative psychological outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations at risk due to pre-existing medical conditions. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks. The primary objective of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate the effect of a videoconference-based program on symptoms of anxiety. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on symptoms of depression, stress, loneliness, boredom, physical activity, and social interaction. METHODS: The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic RCT that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Eligible participants will be SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants without a positive COVID-19 test, with at least mild anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 T-score ≥ 55), not working from home, and not receiving current counselling or psychotherapy. We will randomly assign 162 participants to intervention groups of 7 to 10 participants each or waitlist control. We will use a partially nested RCT design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support. Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference. The primary outcome is PROMIS Anxiety 4a score immediately post-intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The SPIN-CHAT Trial will test whether a brief videoconference-based intervention will improve mental health outcomes among at-risk individuals during contagious disease outbreak.",0
1845,"BACKGROUND: To mitigate and slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have adopted unprecedented physical distancing policies, including the UK. We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). METHODS: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire was conducted online via email recruitment and documents the age and location of contacts and a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday, 24 March, 1 day after a ""lockdown"" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the ""lockdown"" to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. RESULTS: We found a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.8 to 2.8). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22-0.53) for physical (skin to skin) contacts only. CONCLUSIONS: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease, and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.",0
1846,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an advisory for regular and thorough cleaning of hands besides other measures such as social distancing and self-isolation. The rationale for the same is to prevent the transfer of the virus from hands that have come in contact with fomites. While both alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHR) or washing with soap and water are claimed to have been effective, hand sanitizers have gained more popularity due to the ease of use. The increased frequency of ABHR use and the aerosols generated pose a potential threat to the skin and exposed mucosal surfaces, especially that of the eye due to the proximity of use. The adverse effects of alcohol in these sanitizers can be manifold. An allergic or inflammatory response can occur depending on the predisposing or preexisting conditions. This article describes the risks, underlying mechanisms, and preventive measures for sanitizer aerosol-driven ocular surface disease.",0
1849,"This paper discusses social prescribing as part of the wider NHS England universal personalised care model, and it describes how community nurses can engage with social prescribing systems to support community resilience. A case study based on the example of gardening, as a nature-based social prescription provided by the RHS Bridgewater Wellbeing Garden, is provided to illustrate the scope, reach and impact of non-medical, salutogenic approaches for community practitioners. The authors argue that social prescribing and, in particular, nature-based solutions, such as gardening, can be used as a non-medical asset-based approach by all health professionals working in the community as a way to promote health and wellbeing. They consider how the negative impact of social distancing resulting from COVID-19 restrictions could be diluted through collaboration between a holistic, social prescribing system and community staff. The paper presents a unique perspective on how community nurses can collaborate with link workers through social prescribing to help combat social isolation and anxiety and support resilience.",0
1850,"The goal of this column is to help mental health care professionals understand coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so that they can better explain the complexities of the current crisis to their patients. The bottom-line of this column is that, while COVID-19 can infect virtually everyone in the human population, only about 5% are susceptible to severe infection requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or causing a fatal outcome and this population can be identified on the basis of comorbid medical illness and/or age. These numbers are based on experience in China, the United States, and Europe. Table 1 presents an analysis conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is further supported by several other sources reviewed in the article. The population at risk for severe infection are individuals with comorbid medical illness and those 85 years of age and older. The comorbid medical illnesses identified as risk factors are preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised status, morbid obesity (ie, body mass index ≥40), diabetes mellitus, and possibly significant kidney or liver impairment. Parenthetically, news reports and the literature sometimes cite age 60 years and older as a risk factor but age between 60 and 85 years is likely a surrogate for having 1 or more of these comorbid medical conditions. While 5% may initially seem like a small number, it nevertheless potentially represents 16.5 million people, given the United States population of 330 million. That is a tremendous number of people requiring intensive care unit admission and/or potentially dying, and individuals in this population have overwhelmed the US health care system in some hotspots. For this reason, this column suggests taking this at-risk population into account in mitigation strategies when attempting to open the US economy. The column addresses the following questions: (1) What are the 3 aspects of the race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19? (2) What data are currently available to help guide decisions to be made? (3) What strategies have been employed to date and how successful have they been? and (4) Might risk stratification of exposure be a viable strategy to minimize the damage caused by the virus? The race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19 requires that we obtain knowledge about the disease and its treatment or prevention, how to best safeguard public health and avoid overwhelming the health care system, and how to minimize the societal damage caused by substantial disruption of the economy. Data gathered over the past 4 months since the COVID-19 virus emerged as a human pathogen have provided guidance for our decisions going forward. The most widely adopted strategies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to date have involved the epidemiological approach of encouraging good hygiene practices and social distancing, including orders to ""shelter in place,"" quarantine of high-risk individuals, and isolation of infected individuals. The goal of this epidemiological approach has been to ""flatten the curve"" by reducing the height of the peak of the infection to avoid overwhelming the health care system and society in general, while buying time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways to deal with it. However, now that more is known about COVID-19 and the portion of the population that is most at risk for serious adverse outcomes including death, it may be possible to move from a shelter-in-place approach for the entire population to focus on those at most risk and thus facilitate a gradual and rational phased reduction of social restrictions to reopen the economy. Such a graduated opening would be based on regions of countries meeting specific criteria in terms of being able to contain the virus, coupled with vigorous monitoring to look for outbreaks, followed by case monitoring, isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals, and increased use of testing for active disease as well as for immunity. Taking the data on high-risk individuals into account would allow for a gradual lifting of restrictions on the majority of the population while maintaining more stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable portion of the population. Nevertheless, the entire population would need to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing while simultaneously-and perhaps even more vigorously-focusing on sheltering the vulnerable population until adequate community immunity has been achieved to prevent the spread of the virus, whether that is accomplished through natural exposure alone or with the addition of safe and effective vaccine(s) which may not be available for a year. Continued widespread testing for antibodies will help determine how far or close this country is-and other countries are-from developing effective community immunity.",0
1851,"The ongoing global pandemic brought on by the spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is having profound effects on human health and well-being. With no viable vaccine presently available and the virus being rapidly transmitted, governments and national health authorities have acted swiftly, recommending 'lockdown' policies and/or various levels of social restriction/isolation to attenuate the rate of infection. An immediate consequence of these strategies is reduced exposure to daylight, which can result in marked changes in patterns of daily living such as the timing of meals, and sleep. These disruptions to circadian biology have severe cardiometabolic health consequences for susceptible individuals. We discuss the consequences of reductions in patterns of daily physical activity and the resulting energy imbalance induced by periods of isolation, along with several home-based strategies to maintain cardiometabolic health in the forthcoming months.",0

1856,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused high mortality rates among older people, and in order to avoid a healthcare system crisis, almost all countries worldwide have adopted social isolation measures to prevent the spread of the disease. However, in Brazil, a country demarcated by economic inequalities, in which approximately 25% of the population live below the poverty line, these measures will cost severe economic losses and accentuated starvation. For this reason, the underprivileged population should be immediately prioritized and well informed through good practice to avoid the virus. Since, government discrepancies in dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak leaves the population without congruent guidelines on how to react or what to believe, allowing the spread of fake news and political crises. Here, we discuss who will pay the price of the Brazilian government denying the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and suggest some measures to ensure that clear information and protection reach this population.",0
1859,"Emerging pandemics show that humans are not infallible and communities need to be prepared. Coronavirus outbreak was first reported towards the end of 2019 and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

On the other hand, some other nations have put in place effective strategies to contain the infection and have recorded a very low number of cases since the beginning of the pandemics. Restrictive measures like social distancing, lockdown, case detection, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine of exposed had revealed the most efficient actions to control the disease spreading. This review will help the readers to understand the difference in response by different countries and their outcomes.

1860,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease COVID-19, a severe acute respiratory syndrome. COVID-19 is now a global pandemic and public health emergency due to rapid human-to-human transmission. The impact is far-reaching, with enforced social distancing and isolation, detrimental effects on individual physical activity and mental wellbeing, education in the young and economic impact to business. Whilst most COVID-19 patients demonstrate mild-to-moderate symptoms, those with severe disease progression are at a higher risk of mortality. As more is learnt about this novel disease, it is becoming evident that comorbid cardiovascular disease is associated with a greater severity and increased mortality. Many patients positive for COVID-19 demonstrate increased concentrations of cardiac troponin, creating confusion in clinical interpretation. While myocardial infarction is associated with acute infectious respiratory disease, the majority of COVID-19 patients demonstrate stable cTn rather than the dynamically changing values indicative of an acute coronary syndrome.

1862,"BACKGROUND: ""Action at a distance"" may be the new norm for clinical researchers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that may require social distancing for the next 18 months. We must minimize face-to-face contact with vulnerable populations. But we must also persist, adapt, and help our older patients and study participants during the pandemic. METHODS: Clinical researchers have an obligation to help, and we can. Recommendations for clinical researchers working with older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. RESULTS: Implement technology now: Minimize face-to-face contact with participants by utilizing digital tools, such as shifting to electronic informed consent and digital HIPAA-compliant tools such as e-mailed surveys or telehealth assessments. Assess the psychological and social impact of COVID-19: How are participants coping? What health or social behaviors have changed? How are they keeping up with current events? What are they doing to stay connected to their families, friends, and communities? Are their healthcare needs being met? Current studies should be adapted immediately to these ends. Mobilize research platforms for patient needs: Leverage our relationships with participants and rapidly deploy novel clinical engagement techniques such as digital tools to intervene remotely and reduce the negative effects of social isolation on our participants. Equip research staff with tangible resources, and provide timely population-specific health information to support patients and healthcare providers.

1864,"Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a significant threat to many countries. Since the disease does not currently have a particular treatment, there is a compelling need to find substitute means to dominate its expansion. In this rapid review, we aimed to determine some countries' public responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: In this study, academic databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase, were investigated. The keywords applied in the search strategy besides the names of each country were: ""Public Health,"" ""Public Response"", ""Health Policy"", ""COVID-19"", ""Novel Coronavirus,"" ""2019-nCoV"", and ""SARS-CoV-2"". The countries included China, Italy, Iran, Spain, South Korea, Germany, France, United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, and Singapore. Results: The total number of retrieved articles in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase in April 2020 was 594, and after removing 259 duplicate articles, 335 papers were screened by the experts. After this investigation, 50 articles, in addition to 12 webpages, were extensively reviewed for the results section. Public health strategies and responses can be divided into four main areas, including monitoring, public education, crowd controlling, and care facilities. Conclusion: According to the results of the management decisions of some governments on quarantining, social isolation, screening methods, and flight suspensions due to the severity and anonymity of COVID-19, it is highly assured that these strategies would be the most successful approaches to confront the present pandemic. Governments should put in place timely and strict measures to halt the spread and diminish its unintended deadly consequences.",0

1868,"After the video tutorials created a few months ago and published in the Journal of Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology, Milan's Youth Project young cancer patients decided to record another video: a ""special issue"" dedicated to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The video addresses critical issues of the social isolation imposed by the lockdown and the fear the patients face in addition to their actual worries related to the disease. When many people across the world are forced to social distance for the imposed lockdown, the positive attitude and the advice of young cancer patients who experience social isolation regularly may be of great support and a fine example.",0
1869,"COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation. Migraine is one of the commonest and highly disabling chronic neurological diseases in the world. During the pandemic and lockdown, migraine patients are facing an enormous problem in getting optimum care because of difficulty in access, forced social isolation, and encountering a health system that is getting rapidly overwhelmed. It is important that they must be protected by minimizing their visits to the clinics and emergency departments. Paradoxically multiple triggers are in operation which is likely to increase their headache frequency. Hence physicians should be made aware of the new rules of the game in treating migraines during this time of the pandemic so that these patients get optimum treatment and care and don't feel left out. This review tries to answer a series of questions related to managing migraines in the times of COVID-19 pandemic.",0
1870,"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, governments issued movement restrictions and placed areas into quarantine to combat the spread of the disease. In addition, individuals were encouraged to adopt personal health measures such as social isolation. Information regarding the disease and recommended avoidance measures were distributed through a variety of channels including social media, news websites, and emails. Previous research suggests that the vast amount of available information can be confusing, potentially resulting in overconcern and information overload. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of online information on the individual-level intention to voluntarily self-isolate during the pandemic. Using the protection-motivation theory as a framework, we propose a model outlining the effects of cyberchondria and information overload on individuals' perceptions and motivations. METHODS: To test the proposed model, we collected data with an online survey (N=225) and analyzed it using partial least square-structural equation modeling. The effects of social media and living situation were tested through multigroup analysis. RESULTS: Cyberchondria and information overload had a significant impact on individuals' threat and coping perceptions, and through them on self-isolation intention. Among the appraisal constructs, perceived severity (P=.002) and self-efficacy (P=.003) positively impacted self-isolation intention, while response cost (P<.001) affected the intention negatively. Cyberchondria (P=.003) and information overload (P=.003) indirectly affected self-isolation intention through the aforementioned perceptions. Using social media as an information source increased both cyberchondria and information overload. No differences in perceptions were found between people living alone and those living with their families. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, frequent use of social media contributed to information overload and overconcern among individuals. To boost individuals' motivation to adopt preventive measures such as self-isolation, actions should focus on lowering individuals' perceived response costs in addition to informing them about the severity of the situation.",0
1872,"COVID-19 is a pandemic which has affected almost every aspect of our life since starting globally in November 2019. Given the rapidity of spread and inadequate time to prepare for record numbers of sick patients, our surgical community faces an unforeseen challenge. SAGES is committed to the protection and care of patients, their surgeons and staff, and all who are served by the medical community at large. This includes physical health, mental health, and well-being of all involved. The fear of the unknown ahead can be paralyzing. International news media have chronicled the unthinkable situations that physicians and other health care providers have been thrust into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These situations include making life or death decisions for patients and their families regarding use of limited health care resources. It includes caring for patients with quickly deteriorating conditions and limited treatments available. Until recently, these situations seemed far from home, and now they are in our own hospitals. As the pandemic broadened its reach, the reality that we as surgeons may be joining the front line is real. It may be happening to you now; it may be on the horizon in the coming weeks. In this context, SAGES put together this document addressing concerns on clinician stressors in these times of uncertainty. We chose to focus on the emotional toll of the situation on the clinician, protecting vulnerable persons, reckoning with social isolation, and promoting wellness during this crisis. At the same time, the last part of this document deals with the ""light at the end of the tunnel,"" discussing potential opportunities, lessons learned, and the positives that can come out of this crisis.",0
1873,"Background: A series of measures have been suggested to reduce Covid-19 infection, including knowledge training for prevention and control, isolation, disinfection, classified protections at different degrees in infection areas, and protection of confirmed cases. Objectives: We conducted this study with an aim to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice among the general population regarding COVID-19. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out by the Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar in the month of April 2020. The questionnaire had four segments to collect data regarding social-demographic details, knowledge regarding Covid-19, attitude and practice based questions. The questionnaire was shared via social media applications like face book and Whatsapp to reach the target population. Continuous variables were summarized as frequency and percentage. All the analysis was done using Microsoft Excel 2016. Among participants who responded, 1252 (82%) were in the age group of 18-40 years and 912 (60%) from urban areas. Results: A total of 934 (61%) respondents had heard details on COVID-19 from the social media, 1358 (89%) knew all ways of coronavirus transmission, 602 (40%) felt that COVID-19 is a serious disease, 1184 (78%) responded that they totally agree with the lockdown decision, and 1296 (85%) responded that lockdown is helping in reducing the number of cases. The majority, i.e. 1318 (87%), followed advisories and reported washing hands with soap and water regularly, 1108 (73%) reported regularly wearing masks, 1344 (89%) reported following lockdown guidelines, and 1306 (87%) reported maintaining social distancing. The respondents exhibited good knowledge, positive attitude, and sensible practices regarding COVID-19. Conclusion: Our study showed that the respondents have exhibited good knowledge, positive attitude and sensible practices regarding covid-19 during the pandemic.",0
1874,"BACKGROUND: On December 12th 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) emerged in Wuhan, China, sparking a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans (COVID-19). On the 24th of April 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the world, according to the COVID-Case Tracker by Johns Hopkins University, was 195,313, and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases was 2,783,512. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive impact on human health, causing sudden lifestyle changes, through social distancing and isolation at home, with social and economic consequences. Optimizing public health during this pandemic requires not only knowledge from the medical and biological sciences, but also of all human sciences related to lifestyle, social and behavioural studies, including dietary habits and lifestyle. METHODS: Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among the Italian population aged ≥ 12 years. The study comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, current employment); anthropometric data (reported weight and height); dietary habits information (adherence to the Mediterranean diet, daily intake of certain foods, food frequency, and number of meals/day); lifestyle habits information (grocery shopping, habit of smoking, sleep quality and physical activity). The survey was conducted from the 5th to the 24th of April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 3533 respondents have been included in the study, aged between 12 and 86 years (76.1% females). The perception of weight gain was observed in 48.6% of the population; 3.3% of smokers decided to quit smoking; a slight increased physical activity has been reported, especially for bodyweight training, in 38.3% of respondents; the population group aged 18-30 years resulted in having a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet when compared to the younger and the elderly population (p < 0.001; p < 0.001, respectively); 15% of respondents turned to farmers or organic, purchasing fruits and vegetables, especially in the North and Center of Italy, where BMI values were lower. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have provided for the first time data on the Italian population lifestyle, eating habits and adherence to the Mediterranean Diet pattern during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, our data need to be confirmed and investigated in future more extensive population studies.",0
1875,"Sars-CoV-2 complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which require intensive care unit admission. These conditions have rapidly overwhelmed healthcare systems, with detrimental effects on the quality of care and increased mortality. Social isolation strategies have been implemented worldwide with the aim of reducing hospital pressure. Among therapeutic strategies, the use of immunomodulating drugs, to improve prognosis, seems promising. Particularly, since pneumonia and ARDS are associated with a cytokine storm, drugs belonging to therapeutic classes as anti-IL-6, anti-TNF, and JAK inhibitors are currently studied. In this article, we discuss the potential advantages of the most promising pharmacological approaches.",0
1876,"OBJECTIVES: Since the first novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient in Korea was diagnosed on January 20, 2020, 30 patients were diagnosed until February 17, 2020. However, 5,298 additional patients were confirmed until March 4, 2020. Therefore, our objective was to estimate the reproduction number (R) and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures. METHODS: A COVID-19 transmission model (SEIHR) was established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of daily confirmed cases in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province (NGP), the main area of outbreak, was used. The first patient' symptom onset date in the Daegu/NGP outbreak was assumed as January 22, 2020. The R according to the start date of the effect of preventive measures was estimated. RESULTS: The estimated R in Hubei Province, China, was 4.0281, whereas the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.472 and 3.543. When the transmission period decreases from 4-day to 2-day, the outbreak ends early, but the peak of the epidemic increases, and the total number of patients does not change greatly. It was found that, if transmission rate decreases, the outbreak ends early, and the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreases. CONCLUSIONS: To end the COVID-19 epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and wearing masks, are absolutely crucial with the participation of the public, along with the policy of reducing the transmission period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as possible through the efforts of the quarantine authorities.",0
1877,"Fangcang shelter hospitals are a novel public health concept. They were implemented for the first time in China in February, 2020, to tackle the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were large-scale, temporary hospitals, rapidly built by converting existing public venues, such as stadiums and exhibition centres, into health-care facilities. They served to isolate patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 from their families and communities, while providing medical care, disease monitoring, food, shelter, and social activities. We document the development of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and explain their three key characteristics (rapid construction, massive scale, and low cost) and five essential functions (isolation, triage, basic medical care, frequent monitoring and rapid referral, and essential living and social engagement). Fangcang shelter hospitals could be powerful components of national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future epidemics and public health emergencies.",0
1878,"Data on COVID-19 supports targeted social distancing could be an effective way to reduce morbidity and mortality, but could inadvertently increase stigma for affected populations. As health care providers we must be aware of the facts of COVID-19, cultural implications, and potential for stigmatization of populations affected by COVID-2019. It is important to consider the real economic impact related to lost workdays due to quarantine and social isolation efforts as well as travel restrictions that may negatively impact access to care and ability to pay for care. Efforts geared towards general education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the general public can reduce stigmatization. Countries who are successful at aggressive screening, early identification, patient isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and infection control methods should also address the risk of stigmatization among populations and the negative effects which could occur. The cases of COVID-19 will continue to rise and the virus will be sustainable for future infections. Timely and appropriate public health interventions addressing cultural impact and risk for stigmatization along with proper screening, treatment, and follow up for affected individuals and close contacts can reduce the number of infections, serious illness, and deaths.",0
1879,"In light of concerns over the potential detrimental effects of declining care continuity, and the need for connection between patients and health care providers, our multidisciplinary group considered the possible ways that relationships might be developed in different kinds of health care encounters.We were surprised to discover many avenues to invest in relationships, even in non-continuity consultations, and how meaningful human connections might be developed even in telehealth visits. Opportunities range from the quality of attention or the structure of the time during the visit, to supporting relationship development in how care is organized at the local or system level and in the use of digital encounters. These ways of investing in relationships can exhibit different manifestations and emphases during different kinds of visits, but most are available during all kinds of encounters.Recognizing and supporting the many ways of investing in relationships has great potential to create a positive sea change in a health care system that currently feels fragmented and depersonalized to both patients and health care clinicians.The current COVID-19 pandemic is full of opportunity to use remote communication to develop healing human relationships. What we need in a pandemic is not social distancing, but physical distancing with social connectedness.",0
1881,"The maintenance of well-being, healthcare, and social connection is crucial for older adults (OA) and has become a topic of debate as much of the world faces lockdown during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. OAs have been advised to isolate themselves because they are at higher risk for developing serious complications from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Additionally, nursing homes and assisted-living facilities across the country have closed their doors to visitors to protect their residents. Mobile technology such as applications (apps) could provide a valuable tool to help families stay connected, and to help OAs maintain mobility and link them to resources that encourage physical and mental well-being. Apps could address cognitive, visual, and hearing impairments. Our objective was to narratively summarize 15 apps that address physical and cognitive limitations and have the potential to improve OAs' quality of life, especially during social distancing or self-quarantine.",0
1882,"It is impossible to predict or comprehend the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The UK Government's advice for vulnerable people, including older adults, to move towards self-isolation and social distancing is likely to reduce rates of transmission, the risk of severe illness and the impact on the acute health services. Although justified and necessary, this process of isolation is likely to have a negative impact on the mental health of these vulnerable groups, especially older people. It will become increasingly important for community health professionals to assess subtle changes in older persons' mental health, as the duration of this period of isolation remains unclear. The biopsychopharmacosocial model provides one method of assessing mental health and planning health and social care needs. This article hopes to guide community health professionals through the specifics of this assessment model in relation to the growing COVID-19 pandemic.",0

That year, 23% said they'd often or sometimes felt isolated in recent weeks. Now, 50% say that, ABC News reported June 15. The survey, conducted in late May, draws on nearly a half‐century of research from the General Social Survey, which has collected data on American attitudes and behaviors at least every other year since 1972. Most of the new survey's interviews were completed before the death of George Floyd touched off nationwide protests and a global conversation about race and police brutality, adding to the feelings of stress and loneliness Americans were already facing from the COVID‐19 outbreak — especially for black Americans. Compared with surveys conducted after President John F.

1891,"Since the emergence of Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID 19) in China in December 2019, a lot of significant decisions have been taken by the World Health Organization (WHO) and several countries across the globe. As the world reels under the threat of rapid increase in the number of cases and is planning strategies with the limited information available on the virus, it is essential to learn from the experience of countries across the globe. Hence, we selected a few countries in five WHO regions based on their COVID 19 caseload, management strategies and outcome and compared some of the important measures taken by them to contain the spread of infection. Strategies like extensive testing and contact tracing, strict quarantine and isolation measures, Hospital preparedness, complete restriction of non-essential travel, strict border control measures and social distancing measures play a vital role in containment of the spread. All the countries faced the novel strain of virus and implemented similar strategies as per the guidance of WHO, but the extent of preparedness, swiftness with which the decisions were made and the scale of measures made the difference.",0
1892,"COVID-19 has evolved into a pandemic in quick time and being a droplet infection, it was quickly understood that prevention is the key. People started to use all types of masks and there was a panic as stocks started running out. Health care workers must use a triple layered surgical mask and those exposed to aerosol generating procedures must use an N 95 mask and these should be kept reserved for them, especially in a resource limited setting. Though initial advice from experts to the general public was not to use a mask in community settings unless they are sick or taking care of someone sick, the advice had to be later modified. Though CDC Atlanta currently advices everyone with no symptoms to wear cloth masks in the community, WHO opines there is no clear evidence to advise for or against mask use in the community. However, WHO encourages countries advising community mask use as it can generate useful evidence. Along with mask use, practicing all other preventive measures such as handwashing, cough etiquette, social distancing, quarantine and isolation are of utmost importance, without which, using surgical masks or even N95 masks, will not be much effective in the community setting.",0

Methods: A cross‐sectional survey was conducted by distributing online questionnaires to 2430 adult members (> 18 years) of two user panels consisting of people with diabetes who have volunteered to share information about their life with diabetes. The questionnaire included items on COVID‐19‐specific worries as well as such worries related to diabetes, sociodemographic and health status, social relations, diabetes‐specific social support, diabetes distress and changes in diabetes‐specific behaviours. Responses were analysed with descriptive statistics and logistic regressions. Results: People with diabetes have COVID‐19‐specific worries related to their diabetes. More than half were worried about being overly affected due to diabetes if infected with COVID‐19, about one‐third about being characterized as a risk group due to diabetes and not being able to manage diabetes if infected. Logistic regressions showed that being female, having type 1 diabetes, diabetes complications and diabetes distress, feeling isolated and lonely, and having changed diabetes behaviours were associated with being more worried about COVID‐19 and diabetes. Conclusion: People with diabetes have COVID‐19‐specific worries related to their diabetes which is associated with poorer psychosocial health. These worries should be addressed through support targeting specific questions and needs of individuals with diabetes as well as frequent updates on new knowledge regarding COVID‐19 and diabetes. What's new?: Little is known about how worldwide pandemics affect the psychosocial health of people with diabetes.This study showed a high prevalence of diabetes‐specific worries related to COVID‐19, especially fear of being overly affected by the virus, labelling of people with diabetes as a high‐risk group, and inability to manage diabetes if infected.Female gender, type 1 diabetes, diabetes complications, isolation, loneliness, high diabetes distress and behaviour changes were associated with being more worried about COVID‐19 and diabetes.When providing information and support to people with diabetes in time of crisis, attention should be payed to crisis‐specific worries in specific groups.",0

1904,"The ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) epidemic continues to have a global impact. This article describes the author's experience providing nursing care to a female patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning to Taiwan from overseas. During the patient's period of isolation (February 5th to February 29th, 2020), the author used Roy's adaptation model to perform first-level holistic physical, psychological, and social nursing assessments and collected healthproblem information using face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and observations via a remote monitoring system. A second level of assessment confirmed that the problems faced by the patient included (1) existing infections related to COVID-19 and (2) anxiety related to uncertainties about disease prognosis, forgiveness from the family, and potential violations of personal privacy by the media. Due to the special nature of the isolation ward, the author used a remote physiological monitoring system to monitor the vital signs, fever, and shortness of breath status of the patient to quickly decrease her physical discomfort and to improve her self-care ability during hospitalization. Environmental cleanliness was strictly maintained to reduce the risk of cross-infection and ensure patient safety. To alleviate patient anxiety, the author established a good therapeutic interpersonal relationship with the patient by making 10-60 minutes of caring calls to her each day, by providing individual care measures, and by using the Internet to play audio and video to teach mindfulness meditation. Caring for COVID-19 cases is a completely new experience. The author hopes that this experience may be used as a reference for caregivers.",0

1908,"Psychotherapists accelerated their adoption of telepsychotherapy during the COVID-19 outbreak to accommodate preventative isolation and social distancing. Lessons from psychotherapist experiences with technology prior to the outbreak can offer recommendations for practitioners and professional regulators. In this study, psychotherapists were interviewed about their use of technology in practice and interviews were analyzed for consistency with current literature on usual practice and professional regulations. The researchers used actor-network theory to map and explore the links and themes that emerged from the research. We found that technology use was more integrated with psychotherapy practice and psychotherapists were more confident and comfortable with telepsychotherapy than the literature predicted. Key themes arising from the interviews were psychotherapist responsibility and trust that included expanded psychotherapist responsibility, client trust, psychotherapists' self-trust, and trust of information sources. Telepsychotherapy can be enhanced by reflective, intentional practice, making space to examine routine behaviors, and developing strategies to counteract the unreliability of technology. Further, professional and regulatory bodies can support effective practice by developing clear and achievable technological competence responsibilities and by integrating technology training with mandatory psychotherapy education.",0

1954,"Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) will experience high levels of anxiety and low sleep quality due to isolation treatment. Some sleep-improving drugs may inhibit the respiratory system and worsen the condition. Prolonged bedside instruction may increase the risk of medical infections. To investigate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety and sleep quality of COVID-19. In this randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 51 patients who entered the isolation ward were included in the study and randomly divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group used progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) technology for 30 min per day for 5 consecutive days. During this period, the control group received only routine care and treatment. Before and after the intervention, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) and Sleep State Self-Rating Scale (SRSS) were used to measure and record patient anxiety and sleep quality. Finally, data analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0 software. The average anxiety score (STAI) before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.730), and the average anxiety score after intervention was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The average sleep quality score (SRSS) of the two groups before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.838), and it was statistically significant after intervention (P < 0.001). Progressive muscle relaxation as an auxiliary method can reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in patients with COVID-19. • In patients with COVID-19, all confirmed patients need to be treated in isolation due to strong infectivity. According to clinical observation, anxiety and sleep disturbances increased significantly after isolation treatment. Some sleep-promoting drugs may have respiratory depression, and the new coronary virus mainly affects lung tissue, and the use of drugs may increase respiratory depression. Therefore, we use asymptotic muscle relaxation training to alleviate the anxiety and improve sleep quality of patients with COVID-19. This training can be performed remotely and multiple times after one training session, without directly facing the patient, reducing doctor-patient contact and reducing medical infection risk. Currently, COVID-19 has a large number of cases in South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy. I hope our clinical research will be helpful to our country's clinical treatment and the above countries.",0

However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. The study design is a rapid evidence review. We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. We found 3163 articles and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided. • Adherence to quarantine can be difficult, and adherence rates are variable. • Adherence can be affected by perceived risks and social norms. • Knowledge about quarantine protocol is essential. • Public health benefits of quarantine must be made clear.",0

These issues not only involve treating and caring for cardiac patients with the virus, but also include the need to continue routine cardiac interventions during the pandemic. Many cardiac interventions are invasive, requiring close patient contact. As such, these interventions pose significant infection risks. To mitigate against these risks, cardiac nurses should follow established infection control guidelines and wear personal protective equipment where appropriate.

1974,"There has been an impressive development of nursing knowledge around the ethics, principles, frameworks, models and practices of person-centred care over the last 15 years, with colleagues from the Nordic countries making significant contributions to global knowledge across the discipline of nursing and beyond. A disciplinary challenge remains to map the variability in person-centred care with an aim to empirically clarify the invariant in person-centred care. Based on current research and practice, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, this article argues that the relational aspect of person-centred care is such an invariant, building on the socially constructive notion of 'personhood' being a standing or status that is bestowed on one human being by another in the context of relationship and social being. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, several of the key determinants of person-centred care are under threat due to health service responses and/or infection control measures, such as keeping older adults safe, imposing relationship restrictions, social distancing and isolation (or the lack thereof). Clinical examples from an Australian health service are used to show how recognizing the relational invariant of person-centred aged care facilitated supporting lives lived whilst also protecting lives saved. The relational invariant to person-centred care is who we are, constructed or deconstructed by and with others; something that may have become more visible through the relational restrictions imposed due to COVID-19. Protecting relationality in life and care and advocating for both safe and person-centred care for those who need it most is now more important than ever.",0

1976,"At the end of December 2019, a new respiratory virus infection was identified in Wuhan city, China, in the province of Hubei, after patients with acute severe respiratory infections showed clustering. The cases were thought that they could be related to exposure in the Huanan Seafood Market where wholesale fish and live animals are sold in this city. In January 2019, the causative agent was named 2019-nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Coronaviruses are enveloped and single-stranded RNA viruses of the Coronaviridae family and are known as 'crown viruses"" due to their crown-like protrusions on their outer surfaces. They can infect various species. In addition to mild upper respiratory diseases, it is the causative agent of serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 2019-nCoV shows 79% similarity to SARS-CoV and means that bats such as SARS-CoV may have been the original host of this virus. The route of transmission is by respiratory droplets and direct contact. In order to prevent the spread of infection, early diagnosis, proper isolation and personal protective measures are especially important in the hospital environment. The agent uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the cell. The incubation period is usually 3-7 days and can extend up to 14 days. While it is more severe in upper-middle aged people, those with advanced age and additional comorbidities pose risk factors for severe disease. Adult patients have high fever, weakness and dry cough, and some have headaches and muscle pain. As the disease period progresses, shortness of breath acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, clotting disorders, and multiple organ failure may occur. In particular, children can pose an unnoticed threat in spreading the outbreak. Children are less likely than adults to have the infection as an obvious clinical status. The clinical features of the disease are milder and death has not been reported under 10 years of age. Blood count and C-reactive protein values can usually be found normal or slightly increased. In the radiological evaluation of the lung, ground glass appearance and bronchial shadows may be evident. A nucleic acid test is performed from the nose or throat swab to determine the exact cause of the disease. Adequate calorie and fluid intake and the need for oxygen should be ensured in the treatment. An effective anti-virus treatment is not yet available. However, in severe cases, interferon-α nebulization and efficacy have not been proven, lopinavir / ritonavir and chloroquine are recommended. In certain cases, corticosteroids can be used. The virus can be inactivated with disinfectants containing ethanol and chlorine. People with close contacts and suspicious exposure should be advised of 14 days of observation and isolation, starting from the last contact day with the patient infected with 2019-nCoV.

1989,"Background: The global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) began in December 2019. The high levels of stress experienced by nurses during this pandemic may have immediate and long-term effects on their mental health. Purpose: To explore the stress and psychological problems of nurses during this pandemic and to identify strategies used by these nurses to relieve stress. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted that included a basic information datasheet, stress of nursing staff during COVID-19 outbreak scale, psychological distress scale, and stress relief methods survey form. Convenience sampling was used and a total of 469 practicing nurses participated in this study. Results: Most of the participants expressed concerns about living problems (72.7%). On the stress questionnaire, the facets of ""burden of taking care of patients"" and ""worries about social isolation"" earned the first and second highest scores, respectively. In terms of items, ""worrying about infecting family members and friends"" and ""worrying about being separated from family after being infected"" earned the two highest scores (2.35 ± 0.79 and 2.17 ± 0.92, respectively). Scores for psychological distress averaged 5.49 ± 3.83, with stress anxiety (1.32 ± 0.84) earning the highest mean subscale score followed by distress and irritability (1.17 ± 0.92) and depression (1.12 ± 0.94). Nearly twothirds (61.8%) of the participants earned psychological and emotional distress scores within the 'normal' range, and 3.4% earned scores indicating severe distress. ""Receiving education and training"" was the most common method used by the participants to relieve stress (2.27 ± 0.51). Conclusions: The following six strategies are proposed based on the above findings: (1) Caring: provide psychological assessment and care; (2) Supporting: create a friendly team atmosphere and provide support; (3) Inquiring: recruit volunteers with relevant experience; (4) Informing: provide timely, open, and transparent epidemicprevention information; (5) Equipping: provide complete and appropriate epidemic-prevention education and training; (6) Assisting: establish a strategy for family support and caring to reduce the stress and worries of nurses.",0

1999,"Social isolation is a significant psychosocial problem for older adults that has been linked with numerous negative health morbidities such as increased cardiovascular risk (Brummett et al., 2001), falls (Faulkner, Cauley, Zmuda, Griffin, & Nevitt, 2003), cognitive decline (Fratiglioni, Paillard-Borg, & Winblad, 2004) and increased mortality (Berkman & Syme, 1979; Ceria et al., 2001).The main goal of this dissertation was to determine the associations and/or direction of independent variables with social isolation and to use those associated independent variables to model prediction of social isolation over time. Additionally, point prevalence, period prevalence, and incidence rate of social isolation were examined.The design for this study was a secondary data analysis of the Yale Health and Aging Project (YHAP) data. YHAP data were prospective longitudinal over a 12 year time period from 1982--1994. Using the Social Network Index (SNI) as the dependent variable, data from face-to-face interviews in, 1982, 1985, 1988, and 1994 were examined. For this study 2,057 participants met the baseline inclusion criteria.Using generalized estimating equations (GEE), findings showed numerous predictor variables of social isolation. These predictor variables were religious engagement, depressive symptoms gender , marital status, overall health, smoking status, retirement status, life events (having a close friend die) and live alone. One of the most compelling predictors of social isolation was religious engagement. When examining religious engagement, for each increasing level of social isolation those who knew many had an OR of 1.81 (95% CI 1.04--2.19), a few had an OR of 4.96 (95% CI 3.97--6.22), and those who knew none had an OR of 20.55 (95% CI 16.28--25.94) when compared with those who knew almost all members of their congregation.Point prevalence ranged from 21% at baseline to 32% in 1994 whereas 12-year period prevalence was 43%.Through design of this study, the most glaring gaps in the literature, conceptual ambiguity, reverse causality and unknown predictors were all addressed. Findings from this study can help researchers to better understand the predictors of social isolation, allowing for construction of a profile to identify at-risk older adults and targeted interventions to reduce social isolation.",0
2000,"Engagement in social activities impacts the health outcomes of older adults, especially as regards mortality and physical and cognitive disability. Participation and its benefits vary by socioeconomic gradient and ethnicity. This research aims to identify activities of interest to diverse older adults and factors that influence participation (barriers, motives, perceived benefits, and role expectations). We conducted five focus groups throughout Baltimore City with nonactive elders stratified by class, gender, and ethnicity. Activities, motives, and barriers varied across groups. Differences may exist in the challenges and facilitators for maintaining socially active lifestyles among different groups of older adults. Common barriers were found across the groups, in particular the absence of adequate transportation and financial resources, as well as health in the form of mobility difficulties. Nuanced differences among the groups described may help target interventions to particular groups as needed and create opportunities for engagement where extrinsic barriers might exist. Findings were disseminated to community partners to improve awareness of social factors in developing health-promoting strategies for active and meaningful roles for older adults.",0

Public involvement and inclusion schemes, such as befriending, may provide some solutions to this problem, but healthcare professionals need to be aware of these issues and to work towards community-focused solutions to avoid greater demands on health and social care resources.",0
2002,"Men often struggle to find or gain access to meaningful health services. Despite, or because of this trend, men are increasingly seeking out alternative sources of support for their wellbeing. Global health conversations and policies are calling for a greater awareness of men's heath issues, uptake of gender-sensitive strategies and integration of community and voluntary sectors. Men's Sheds, which are community and volunteer-run spaces for men, are increasing in popularity for men across Ireland. This study aimed to investigate men's experiences as members of Men's Sheds and the relationship between their involvement in the Shed and their wellbeing. Qualitative methods including: semi-structured interviews, focus groups and observations were used with men (n = 27) from five different Sheds across Ireland. Findings suggest that key features of Shed participation (i.e. using and developing new skills, feeling a sense of belonging, supporting and being supported by peers, and contributing to community) contribute to men's overall wellbeing as well as men's buy-in or support for Men's Sheds. Despite support for Men's Sheds, negotiating membership, funding and boundaries of peer support remain persistent challenges that threaten the sustainability of Shed space and membership. Future work that examines opportunities for meaningful collaboration between Sheds and surrounding community services could help provide more pathways for men to access support without compromising the integrity and intentionality of Sheds as peer-run spaces.",0
2003,"Reminiscence therapy helps elders recall memories of old times through activities designed to achieve self-healing. The qualitative case in this research was a 70 year-old woman who had lived in a military village for 40 years. Semi-structured questionnaires were used for the interview and data was recorded and transcribed word for word. Analytical methods used the three major patterns of reminiscing over objects, vertical and horizontal life. In reminiscing over objects, the author performed interconnected analysis using selected objects that were beloved and/or had special meaning to the subject. In the perspective of vertical life, the author explored the subject's life experiences through each life stage (childhood, adolescence, middle age, and aged). Themes examined included the Confucian ethical code and patriarch, marriage, economic life, and living alone with loneliness. In the perspective of horizontal life, the author described and analyzed special events in the subject's life, including themes of illness and death, serving in the KMT (Kuomintang) political party and women's organizations, and the contribution of medical treatment. Life experience stories from the subject's four decades living in a military housing community was shared through personal photos. Such a process was targeted to help integrate the life experience of an aged woman in a military housing community and confirm the meaning, value, and contribution of her own life.",0
2004,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the way in which the housing and neighbourhood accessibility and neighbourhood connectedness of older lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people aged 50 and over, differ compared to non-LGB older people. Design/methodology/approach – This paper utilises data collected as part of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing as well as theories around social exclusion to explore these issues, using information from 5,442 survey respondents including 260 identified as LGB. Findings – Little evidence is uncovered of a link between being LGB and experiencing exclusion from decent housing, public transport or neighbourhood amenities. Significant differences were uncovered in levels of home ownership and the numbers who reported having seen a friend the previous day, the likelihood of which were both lower for LGB people compared to non-LGB people. Research limitations/implications – All analyses are subject to caveats around the size of the sample and the method of identifying LGB older people. The findings could suggest older LGB people may be less likely to have property wealth from which to draw down in retirement. Furthermore, the findings on older LGB people being less likely to have seen a friend the previous day, may suggest a need for more opportunities to be made available for LGB people to maintain their social networks closer to home to offset the risk of social isolation. Originality/value – This is one of the first studies to examine how the housing and neighbourhood accessibility and connectedness patterns of older LGB people differ from non-LGB people in the UK.",0

The Naturally Occurring Retirement Community (NORC) model has emerged as a strategy to utilize existing resources and develop a comprehensive approach to maintaining older adult functional status. However, little has been written about how community capacity influences NORC implementation. A community capacity framework was used to analyze the themes that emerged from participant and service provider interviews at two diverse NORC sites. The findings revealed that perceptions of a sense of community and partnership management influenced the NORC experience for participants and providers.",0
2007,"The proportion of older people in the UK population is rising, and those aged 65 years and over are particularly at risk of malnutrition. This is caused by factors such as underlying disease, poor oral health, decreased mobility, limited transport to local shops, social isolation and poverty. Older men, particularly those who live alone, may be even more at risk of an inadequate diet. This paper presents findings from a subset of the Low Income Diet and Nutrition Survey, a national survey of materially deprived individuals aged 2 years and over in the UK. The influence of social, physical and other factors on foods consumed and nutrient intake in 234 men (unweighted sample) aged 65 years and over who either lived alone or with other(s) of retirement age is investigated. Mean energy intakes fell below the estimated average requirement (84%), while mean intakes of several micronutrients fell below the reference nutrient intake (vitamin D 35%, magnesium 77%, potassium 75%, and zinc 88%). Men living in households where the person mainly responsible for shopping and preparing food had poorer cooking skills had a lower consumption of vegetables, wholemeal bread and fish and fish dishes, and lower intakes of energy and selected nutrients. Men who experienced difficulty in chewing consumed less fruit, vegetables, wholemeal bread and meat and meat dishes, and had lower intakes of protein and selected nutrients. Interventions need to focus on improving cooking skills, especially in men who live or eat alone, and on increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables in those with poor oral health, especially those who have difficulty chewing.",0
2008,"Objective: To examine whether the health and functioning of middle-aged and older adults are associated with an increased likelihood of community-based moves. Method: Biennial data from adults aged 51 and older in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and discrete-time survival models were used to assess the likelihood of community-based moves from 2000 to 2010 as a function of 11 measures of health and functioning. Results: Respondents diagnosed with heart disease, stroke, hypertension, lung disease, and psychiatric problems were more likely to move during the study period than those with no such diagnosis. Changes in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living functioning, cognitive impairment, and falls were also related to a greater likelihood of moving during the study period. Cancer and diabetes were not related to overall moves, although diabetes was associated with an increased likelihood of local moves. For the most part, it was longstanding not recent diagnoses that were significantly related to the likelihood of moving. Discussion: Although some health conditions precipitate moves among middle-aged and older adults, others do not. This work has important implications for understanding the role of different aspects of health and functioning in the likelihood of migration among older adults.",0
2009,"Aging is upon us, globally, nationally, in our communities, in our families and in us. In many countries, the unprece- dented demographic shift is momentous, touching virtu- ally every aspect of society. In countries ravaged by poverty, disease and war, older people are facing extreme occupational challenges and injustices. Just as we share our love of chil- dren regardless of nation or circumstance, our call to serve and cherish our elders brings us together as a human race and as a profession. As occupational therapy prac- titioners, our commitment to society encompasses the lifespan. The call to strengthen our contribution to the lives of expanding numbers of older adults and their families is compelling (Horowitz and Coppola 2007).

2011,"Objectives: This study described the association between dental care service utilization and two domains of social relationships (social integration and social support) among older adults. Methods: The study employed data from the 2008 Health and Retirement Study, examining regression models for whether a person visited a dentist in the past 2 years, including adjustments for demographic, socioeconomic, and health characteristics. Results: Social interaction, social participation, neighborhood cohesion, and marital status were related to an increased likelihood of having visited a dentist. Older persons exhibiting loneliness and having received financial aid from network members demonstrated a decreased likelihood of visiting a dentist. The increased likelihood of visiting a dentist when a child lives nearby only occurred after introducing health covariates. Discussion: The article discusses the implications of the study findings as they relate to social relationships and oral health and recommends some additional research directions to explore the etiology of dental care use.",0
2012,"A high sense of belonging to the community and physical activity are associated with improved mental health in older people. The present study tested a model incorporating physical activities performed alone and with others as predictors of sense of belonging, depression and suicide ideation. One hundred and ninety four retired adults (87 males, 107 females, mean age 68 years) completed the Yale Physical Activity Survey, the Sense of Belonging Instrument, the Suicide Subscale of the General Health Questionnaire and the Zung Depression Inventory. Within the context of the model, neither participating in physical activities alone, nor with at least one other person, predicted sense of belonging, depression or suicide ideation. Having the abilities and motivation to belong was a predictor of participating in physical activities with others and actual feelings of belonging and contributed to predicting mental health in retirees. It was concluded that simply performing activities with others was not associated with a sense of belonging or mental health. Rather, sense of belonging may need to be facilitated in order for mental health to be enhanced.",0
2013,"Using socioemotional selectivity theory as a framework, the study described in this article examined the extent to which social support from friends both within and outside of a retirement community was associated with depression. Although levels of social support from friends within the retirement community were quantitatively high, they failed to have a significant effect on depression. In contrast, social support from friends living elsewhere consistently predicted low levels of depression. Practice implications include the importance of maintaining friendship ties with people living elsewhere and of strengthening friendship ties within the retirement community.",0
2014,"Studies indicate that living alone, or living in anonymous housing complexes-such as Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs)-can produce feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can negatively affect psychological well-being and physical health. Little is known about how NORCs, occupied by relatively poor older minorities may provide a context for low-cost interventions directed at enhancing well-being and therefore health. Given that traditional health education interventions have been ineffective among minority seniors, the goal of this study is to introduce a low-cost, on-site psycho-educational health intervention program to older NORC residents, that includes: (1) a formal health education component to encourage good health (health behavior), and (2) an informal recreational component focusing on peoples' psychological well-being (social facilitation). The research question is: ""Would social facilitation improve psychological well-being and health?"" Forty-five aging Black residents of two NORCs were assigned to either an intervention condition for 8-weeks (group 1, n = 26) or a control condition (group 2, n = 19). Group 1 was expected to show improvement in psychological well-being and health, and such improvements were expected to be retained well after the sessions. Data were gathered from both groups, at baseline, post intervention, and 2 months following the intervention. Results indicate that there was a significant time by treatment effect for well-being. There was no significant time by treatment effect, but there was a significant treatment effect for health behaviors. This shows that short-term psycho-educational intervention can positively affect the quality of life of older minority residents of NORCs.",0

Loneliness is of significant concern in older adults, as it can negatively affect their quality of life. An interpretive phenomenological study was conducted to explore the meaning of loneliness in 12 older adults living in the community. Selected excerpts from the participants reveal several themes, as well as the importance of maintaining meaningful connections and relationships with others to alleviate feelings of loneliness. Nurses can become more attuned to the problem of loneliness in older adults and the importance of helping their older clients maintain meaningful connections with others to reduce loneliness.",0
2018,"The purpose of this interpretive phenomenological study was to explore the meaning of loneliness in community-dwelling older adults and to understand their daily practices in coping with loneliness. The sample consisted of eight women and four men between the ages of 74 and 98 years. Participants had to be cognitively intact, scoring less than 12 on the Short Blessed Test. Participants who scored greater than 10 on the Geriatric Depression Scale, Short Form, were excluded to avoid conflating loneliness with severe depression. Data collection tools included the UCLA Loneliness Scale and a demographic survey. Interview guides included the History Interview, the Loneliness Coping Interview, and the Daily Life Interview. Interviews were conducted sequentially every 3-4 weeks for a total of three visits and 4 interviews per participant.A critical finding was that many participants experienced loneliness as a result of disrupted meaningful engagements, due to age-related changes, as well as other losses, including death of spouse, retirement, and giving up the car. Two paradigm cases, as well as themes representing the loneliness and coping experience emerged. Participant coping practices with loneliness included: reaching out to others,helping those in need, and seeking companionship with pets. Loneliness as an embodied experience showed up in participants' accounts as fatigue, tension, withdrawal, and emptiness. Some participants described sleeping as a form of withdrawal which helped them to temporarily forget their loneliness.Many older adults are at risk for loneliness because of declining health and other age-related losses that prevent them from remaining engaged in meaningful relationships. Nurses can screen for loneliness to identify those at risk and can intervene to help older adults maintain connections. Recommendations for nurses caring for lonely older adults included: active listening, vision and hearing screenings, transportation needs, home visits, support groups, telephone/lifeline services, computer-assisted social support, pet therapy, volunteering, and engagement in social activities. These interventions will support social integration in older adults by helping older adults remain engaged and active.",0
2019,"Using an ethological framework of attachment developed by Bowlby and the social provisions of relationships delineated by Weiss, this article explores the ways in which family pets, in particular dogs and cats, provide certain components of attachment that contribute to emotional and social well-being throughout the life cycle. Pets may supply ongoing comfort and reduce feelings of loneliness during adversity or stressful transitions such as divorce or bereavement. They can also provide an opportunity to nurture others. In clinical practice it helps to be aware of how significant a pet may be to a client.

We find that the likelihood of living alone is higher in generous welfare states, with social support and spending both positively associated with living alone. The relationship between personal resources and living alone has a smaller positive gradient in countries with robust welfare systems. The lack of adequate public support in less generous welfare states may constrain the ability of many low-income older adults with out a partner to continue living independently.",0

In an attempt to lessen these situations as much as possible, a project has been born. It aims to create a service that offers the elderly the possibility of relating with other persons and of developing their creative, physical, etc. potential both at home and outside of it by programs that include activities which interest them.

2023,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of self-care on the prevalence of loneliness among elderly people living in retirement homes and older people living in their homes/communities.Design/methodology/approach The research was conducted through standardized SELSA-L assessment loneliness questionnaires and the Self Care Assessment Worksheet for self-care assessment. The results were processed using the Kruskal–Wallis test.Findings The obtained results have shown that impaired self-care ability affects the prevalence of loneliness among the elderly almost the same in both groups of participants. However, regarding the relationship between the state of health and self-care, only a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of loneliness is found in the case of the participants living in their homes, with the worst health condition affecting the poorer psychological care.Research limitations/implications It is necessary to point out the limitations of the research, primarily sample limitations and the selected design of the study. The sample consisted of two different and relatively small groups of participants which could adversely affect the representativeness of the sample and reduce the possibility of generalising the results. The next limiting factor is the age distribution the authors used in the research, where the age of the participants as a very important variable was collected by age range and not precisely which consequently resulted in inequality in subgroup sizes. Thus, the middle age (75–85) covers up to ten years, which is a huge range at an older age and can mean major differences in functional ability, and can impact the self-care assessment.Practical implications Nurses are indispensable in care for the elderly and they need to promote and encourage self-care of the elderly through health care. Elderly people living in retirement homes should be allowed to participate equally in health care in order to preserve their own autonomy and dignity. However, to benefit those who live in their homes, nurses should be connected to the local community and thus stimulate various forms of preventative (testing blood sugar levels, blood pressure and educating on the importance of preventive examinations) or recreational activities in the environment of elderly people with the goal of preserving their functional abilities.Originality/value The impact of self-care on loneliness was not sufficiently researched, and this paper contributed to understanding the complexity of loneliness phenomena among the elderly with the aim of developing a model of prevention.",0

Interviews were thematically analysed.Findings Analysis revealed three key themes: connecting and disconnecting, points of vulnerability and older identity. Social connections were important to participants and many felt disconnected at times. Findings underline the importance of understanding the social perceptions of older people and how individuals themselves conceptualise older age.Research limitations/implications Further research is needed to explore the value of social media in reducing feelings of loneliness generally. With regards to social implication the author suggests that older people need to be more visible and loneliness needs to be normalised and discussed without stigmatisation. In practical terms as people get older, and particularly as they retire, people need opportunities to re/engage with their geographically local community. The author suggests that preventing loneliness may mean finding supportive structures to enable this such as local community-based retirement classes. It is important to note that this research concentrated on one particular community in Bristol and needs to be replicated in order to further explore findings.Originality/value This research adopted a co-produced approach and involved community professionals, academics and local older people working together to explore the issue of loneliness.

Journal of Advanced Nursing 69(2), 394-403. Abstract Aim. The aim of this study is to explore older people's approaches to living a life characterized by losses and 'aloneness' and how this relates to loneliness. Background. Loneliness is closely related to social status and health condition. Older people are vulnerable to experiences of loneliness due to losses, which follow the ageing process. Method. A qualitative interpretative design was used. Older people, aged 65 and above, living at home, in retirement villages, or in long-term care settings in Australia, Norway, and UK participated. Seventy-eight persons were included. Data were collected through open-ended interviews during autumn of 2006 and spring of 2007. The interviews were audio taped, transcribed, and analysed applying a hermeneutic, interpretative process. Findings. Analyses revealed great differences in the way participants handled their life situation. Interviewees describing themselves as 'not lonely' viewed losses as normal, and they participated in meaningful activities, connected to other people and thrived in their own company. Those describing themselves as 'lonely' on the other hand, strove to create meaning in their lives, were overwhelmed by losses, had problems finding meaningful activities and difficulty keeping up social relations. Conclusion. Loneliness was associated with overwhelming losses, inactivity, meaninglessness, and social isolation. The contrasting findings between 'not lonely' and 'lonely' older people have implications for nursing in that nurses must seek to identify those who need help in managing their loneliness and give guidance and support. More research is needed to develop interventions that are effective in reducing loneliness.",0
2027,"Loneliness is a significant health risk for older people, linked with bereavement, living alone and declining health. Previous research suggests loneliness is common amongst residents of English retirement housing, who show a relatively high incidence of these factors. This invites the question, what can providers of retirement housing do to help their residents avoid loneliness, thus remaining healthier and less likely to need care services? Through a survey of 326 retirement-estate managers, we investigate the role of staff and residents' groups in developing organised social activities for residents in retirement housing, and the potential of these activities for generating social contacts which may provide a pathway to avoid loneliness. The survey was informed by a literature review with two objectives: firstly, to consider the nature and causes of loneliness amongst older people and how these apply to retirement housing residents; secondly, to identify good practice models of previous interventions designed to widen social interactions for older people or provide emotional support. The sample was drawn from the all-England property portfolio of a major provider of retirement housing for people over 55. The sampled estates, mostly social rented but including some with a mixture of leasehold and rented dwellings, represent a sector also described as sheltered or supported housing, which has over 550,000 dwellings in the United Kingdom. It is characterised by having some form of staff support for people who are frail, immobile or isolated, such that they may occasionally need help available on call. In the literature review, we consider how different kinds of social contact can help develop friendships and meet social support needs, in retirement housing and elsewhere – in particular, organised group activities (clubs, classes, etc.) and specific interventions designed to address loneliness. The fieldwork suggests that organised activities in retirement housing have considerable potential to meet residents' social support needs, but that this potential is often not fully realised. A wider range of activities is needed, which may require the support of housing management staff, volunteers and community organisations.",0
2028,"This study examines the impact of social engagement on elderly health in China. A two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) regression approach was used to examine the causal relationship. Our dataset comprises 9253 people aged 60 or above from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS) conducted in 2011 and 2013. Social engagement significantly improved the self-rated health of the elderly and reduced mental distress, but had no effect on chronic disease status. Compared with the rural areas, social engagement played a more important role in promoting the elderly health status in urban areas. Social engagement could affect the health status of the elderly through health behavior change and access to health resources. To improve the health of the elderly in China and promote healthy aging, the government should not only improve access to effective medical care but also encourage greater social engagement of the elderly.",0
2029,"BACKGROUND: Retirees face numerous challenges, including disassociation from persons in their social networks in Nigeria. Perceived social isolation or loneliness could impair the quality of life in old age, and lead to mental disorders. However, it is uncertain whether perceived loneliness has an independent association with depressive and anxiety symptoms and comorbid conditions in Nigerian retirees. Therefore, we aimed at examining the association between perceived loneliness, depressive and anxiety symptoms, including comorbid conditions among retirees in Northcentral Nigeria. METHODS: This community-based cross-sectional study enrolled retirees aged 60 years and above in different pension zones from February 2019 to August 2019. A two-stage sampling procedure was used to select the study participants. Data on perceived loneliness, depressive, and anxiety symptoms were collected using the 8-item University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (ULS-8), and the DASS 21-depression and anxiety subscales, respectively. We collected information on the demographic characteristics using a well-validated structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, binary and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine the independent associations between loneliness, depression, anxiety, and anxious depression. P-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 71.3 (± 6.01) years, and 54.4% were men. The prevalence of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and anxious depression was 21.8, 52.0, 27.7, and 20.5%, respectively. Retirees with depression or anxiety symptoms perceived that they were lonelier than those without depression or anxiety. The multivariable logistic regression model showed that female gender (AOR 1.49; 95% CI (1.09, 2.00), having secondary education (AOR 2.24, 95% CI (1.40, 3.57) and having higher education (AOR 3.82, 95%CI (2.37, 6.16) were significantly associated with depression. Also, lonely retirees are 1.19 times (AOR 1.19; 95% CI (0.84, 1.69) more likely to be depressed compared to retirees that are not lonely, and the anxious depressed retirees are 314.58 times (AOR 314.58; 95% CI (508.05, 1941.70) more likely to be depressed than those without anxious depression. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and anxious depression were relatively high among the older retirees.

2030,"Loneliness and social isolation are significant public health problems. However, the community and neighborhood factors that contribute to this pandemic are less examined. Adopting a neighborhood resource-based social capital theory, we examined whether neighborhood trust was associated with older Americans' loneliness, number of friends, and perceived support from friends. We analyzed two waves of longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, with a sample of 5,817 Americans aged 50 years and older. We used first difference models to analyze the data and controlled for potential confounders including perceived support from family and health status. Increases in the perception that neighbors are trustworthy and helpful were associated with statistically significant decreases in loneliness and increases in perceived social support from friends over a 4-year period. Findings have implications for conceptualizing social capital and for potential interventions targeting interpersonal trust and reducing loneliness and social isolation.",0
2031,"CONTEXT: An outbreak of gastrointestinal (GI) illness among retirement community residents was reported to the Maricopa County Department of Public Health. Online surveys can be useful for rapid investigation of disease outbreaks, especially when local health departments lack time and resources to perform telephone interviews. Online survey utility among older populations, which may lack computer access or literacy, has not been defined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate and implement prevention measures for a GI outbreak and assess the utility of an online survey among retirement community residents. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort investigation was conducted using an online survey distributed through the retirement community e-mail listserv; a follow-up telephone survey was conducted to assess computer literacy and Internet access. A case was defined as any GI illness occurring among residents during March 1-14, 2012. SETTING: A barbecue in a retirement community of 3000 residents. PARTICIPANTS: Retirement community residents. INTERVENTION: Residents were directed to discard leftover food and seek health care for symptoms. A telephone survey was conducted to assess the utility of online surveys in this population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Computer literacy and Internet access of retirement community residents. RESULTS: Of 1000 residents on the listserv, 370 (37%) completed the online survey (mean age, 69.7 years; 60.6% women); 66 residents (17.8%) reported a GI illness after the barbecue, 63 (95.5%) reported diarrhea, and 5 (7.6%) reported vomiting. Leftover beef from an attendee's refrigerator grew Clostridium perfringens. Of 552 residents contacted by telephone, 113 completed the telephone survey (mean age, 71.3 years; 63.3% women), 101 (89.4%) reported the ability to send e-mail, 82 (81.2%) checked e-mail daily, and 28 (27.7%) checked e-mail on a handheld device. The attack rate was 17.8% for online versus 2.7% for telephone respondents (P < .001).

2032,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: older adults have increased risk of social isolation, loneliness and cognitive functioning impairment, but the relationships among these factors are not conclusive. We investigated the potential mediation mechanism of loneliness on the association between social isolation and cognitive functioning among Chinese older adults within their cultural context. DESIGN: secondary analysis of the baseline wave (2011-12) of the harmonised China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: community-dwelling older adults in China (N = 7,410 participants aged 60-101 years). METHODS: we applied a multiple indicator multiple cause approach to determine whether the construct of social isolation is well defined by four indicators (social activity engagement, weekly adult children contact, caregiving for grandchildren and living alone) and used structural equation modelling to examine the direct and indirect effects among variables of interest. RESULTS: the results demonstrated that social activity engagement, weekly adult children contact and caregiving for grandchildren were significantly related to social isolation (β = -0.26 to -0.28) (Living alone was fixed to 1 for model identification.) The indirect effect of social isolation on cognitive functioning through loneliness was significant (β = -0.15), indicating loneliness was an important mediator. However, the direct effect of social isolation on cognitive functioning also remained significant (β = -0.83), suggesting a partial mediation effect. CONCLUSIONS: our study highlights the mediation role of loneliness in the relationship between social isolation and cognitive functioning among Chinese older adults. The findings support the beneficial effects of maintaining social relations and coping with feelings of loneliness on older adults' cognitive functioning.",0
2033,"Given that there is limited research examining the specific role social isolation plays in stroke risk, we aimed to estimate the controlled direct effect of social isolation on stroke risk in China. A nationally representative sample (n = 12,662) of persons aged 45 years or more at baseline (2011), with corresponding follow-ups in 2013 and 2015, was taken from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Stroke was assessed through a self- or proxy-reported physician's diagnosis. Social isolation was measured by incorporating marital status, frequency of contact with friends, family, and children, and participation in social activities. A marginal structural model with stabilized inverse probability weights was applied to examine the controlled direct effect of social isolation on stroke risk. Overall, 245 persons had a stroke within the 4-year timeline under study. The total effect model indicated that persons experiencing social isolation had a 64% increased risk of stroke (odds ratio (OR) = 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.26, 2.13). Results from the marginal structural model also indicated that socially isolated persons had an increased risk of stroke (OR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.49, 3.82) after adjustment for depression. Interventions to reduce social isolation may be particularly beneficial in preventing the occurrence of stroke among middle-aged and older adults in China.",0
2035,"Interventions to reduce caregiver burden are of great interest as the number of informal family caregivers continues to grow. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of an online mindfulness meditation intervention for community-dwelling older adult caregivers and to evaluate its impact on quality of life, caregiver burden, and psychological well-being. A total of 40 caregivers were recruited from 2 community center support groups to participate in an 8-week online mindfulness intervention. Pre and post surveys were administered. Retention rates were high with 55% completing the post surveys and attending at least 5 out of 8 sessions. Matched pairs t test indicated that the intervention reduced caregiver burden, perceived stress, anxiety, and loneliness and improved mental well-being. Online interventions offer flexibility for caregivers regardless of their responsibilities. Future research should expand this opportunity and explore the scalability of online mindfulness interventions.",0
2036,"The 'epidemic' of heart failure seems to be changing, but precise prevalence estimates of heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) in older adults, based on adequate echocardiographic assessment, are scarce. Systematic reviews including recent studies on the prevalence of heart failure and LVD are lacking. We aimed to assess the trends in the prevalence of LVD, and heart failure with reduced (HFrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the older population at large. A systematic electronic search of the databases Medline and Embase was performed. Studies that reported prevalence estimates in community-dwelling people ≥60 years old were included if echocardiography was used to establish the diagnosis. In total, 28 articles from 25 different study populations were included. The median prevalence of systolic and 'isolated' diastolic LVD was 5.5% (range 3.3-9.2%) and 36.0% (range 15.8-52.8%), respectively. A peak in systolic dysfunction prevalence seems to have occurred between 1995 and 2000. 'All type' heart failure had a median prevalence rate of 11.8% (range 4.7-13.3%), with fairly stable rates in the last decade and with HFpEF being more common than HFrEF [median prevalence 4.9% (range 3.8-7.4%) and 3.3% (range 2.4-5.8%), respectively]. Both LVD and heart failure remain common in the older population at large. The prevalence of diastolic dysfunction is on the rise and currently higher than that of systolic dysfunction. The prevalence of the latter seems to have decreased in the 21st century.",0
2037,"OBJECTIVES: We explored the moderated-mediation effects of perceived accessibility to the environment on quality of life in later life via two socio-spatial mediators (loneliness and connection to place) and two moderators (functional disability and marital status). METHODS: We utilized the data of the fifth wave of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) to analyze the quality of life of 13,828 Europeans aged 65 or older. Bootstrapping with resampling strategies was used to test the moderated-mediation hypotheses. RESULTS: Higher scores for perceived accessibility to services and sites was associated with greater quality of life. This relationship was partially mediated by lower loneliness and higher connection to place, and moderated by functional disability and marital status. DISCUSSION: Policymakers and planners should plan suitable, accessible and age-friendly social and spatial environments for dependent and independent older adults. They should also suggest interventions to mitigate social loneliness and modify spatial obstacles.",0
2038,"BACKGROUND: Rural and remote communities in Australia fare worse than their urban counterparts across major health indicators, with geographic isolation, restricted accessibility to health services, socioeconomic disadvantage, lifestyle and behavioural factors all implicated in poorer health outcomes. Health disparities, which are especially stark in Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, underscore the urgent need to build a culturally responsive and respectful rural health workforce. Allied health student placements in settings with high Aboriginal populations provide opportunities for the development of cultural capabilities and observation of the causes and impact of health disparities. A service learning pedagogy underpinned by strong campus-community partnerships can contribute to effective situated learning. Positive placement experiences can also encourage future rural practice alleviating workforce shortages. This article reports on the first stage of a proposed longitudinal investigation into the impact of remote placements on clinical practice and employment choices. METHODS: In-depth interviews were undertaken with health science students and recent graduates from Australian universities who spent up to 4 weeks at the remote community of Mt. Magnet (Badimaya country) in Western Australia. Interviews, which occurred between two and 12 months following the placement were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed for patterns of meaning. RESULTS: Factors which contributed to positive professional, personal and socially responsive learning experiences were identified. These included pre-placement cultural training to build understanding of the local Aboriginal community, peer support, community engagement, cultural exchanges and interprofessional collaboration. Highlights were associated with relationship-building in the community and opportunities to apply insights into Aboriginal cultural ways to clinical and community practice. The role of the Aboriginal mentor was integral to students' understanding of the social and cultural dynamics in the practice setting. Challenges related to the logistics of supervision in remote locations and workloads. CONCLUSIONS: The interprofessional placement offered students a unique opportunity to experience how isolation, socioeconomic disadvantage and cultural factors conspire to produce health inequities in remote Australian settings and to observe how communities respond to their circumstances. Despite difficulties encountered, learnings derived from the application of clinical, social and interprofessional skills, and rural employment opportunities that arose following graduation, were all highly valued.",0
2039,"Background:                      As the first large numbers of female physicians complete their careers, information is needed to enable institutions and individuals to optimize the final career phase and transition to retirement of these women, as well as to help younger women physicians prepare for later phases of their careers.                          Materials and Methods:                      To identify the leading issues for older female physicians, a 34-item electronic questionnaire covering heath, finances, preparation for and attitudes about retirement, caretaking responsibilities, life-work integration, various aspects of discrimination and harassment, professional isolation, and work-related stress and burnout-incorporating standardized measures of career satisfaction was distributed through the Kansas Medical Society and nationally through the American Medical Association Senior Physicians Section newsletter to female physicians older than 60 years in 2018. A total of 155 physicians self-identified as eligible and completed at least half of the survey.                          Results:                      Respondents were 60-87 years of age, mean 70.4 (±6.4) years. The majority reported good health and being financially well prepared for retirement. Twenty percent were caretakers for grandchildren, parents, or spouses. Measures of career and job satisfaction were reasonably high, despite negative work environment and burnout scores. Problems with family/career balance, age- and gender-based discrimination and harassment, salary inequity, and professional isolation persisted throughout their careers, but diminished in frequency for senior women.                          Conclusions:                      Issues faced by younger women physicians do not disappear with age or seniority. To recruit and support female physicians, issues such as balancing family/work responsibilities, combating harassment and bias, and promoting healthy work environments must be addressed throughout their entire careers.",0
2040,"The purpose of this interpretive phenomenological study was to explore the meaning of loneliness in community-dwelling older adults and to understand their daily practices in coping with loneliness. The sample consisted of 8 women and 4 men. Interviews were conducted with the 12 participants utilizing several tools, including 3 separate interview guides and the UCLA Loneliness Scale, Version 3 (Russell, 1996). A critical finding was that many participants experienced loneliness as a result of disrupted meaningful engagement, due to age-related changes, as well as other losses, including death of spouse, retirement, and giving up the car. Two paradigm cases and themes representing the loneliness and coping experience emerged. Participant coping practices with loneliness included reaching out to others, helping those in need, and seeking companionship with pets. Many older adults are at risk for loneliness because of declining health and other age-related losses that prevent them from remaining engaged in meaningful relationships. Health care professionals can screen for loneliness to identify those at risk and can intervene to help older adults maintain connections. Recommendations for those caring for lonely older adults include active listening, vision and hearing screenings, transportation needs, pet therapy, volunteering, and engagement in social activities.",0
2041,"Despite increasing interest in the bacterium, the methodology for Clostridium difficile recovery has not yet been standardized. Cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose taurocholate (CCFT) has historically been the most used medium for C. difficile isolation from human, animal, environmental, and food samples, and presumptive identification is usually based on colony morphologies. However, CCFT is not totally selective. This study describes the recovery of 24 bacteria species belonging to 10 different genera other than C. difficile, present in the environment and foods of a retirement establishment that were not inhibited in the C. difficile selective medium. These findings provide insight for further environmental and food studies as well as for the isolation of C. difficile on supplemented CCFT.",0
2042,"Olfactory dysfunction is a common complaint among physician visits. Olfactory loss affects quality of life and impairs function and activities of daily living. The purpose of our study was to assess the degree of odor identification associated with mental health. Olfactory function was measured using the brief smell identification test. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Loneliness was assessed by the de Jong-Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Cognition was measured by a battery of 19 cognitive tests. The frequency of olfactory dysfunction in our study was ~40%. Older subjects had worse olfactory performance, as previously found. More loneliness was associated with worse odor identification. Similarly, symptoms of depression were associated with worse olfaction (among men). Although better global cognitive function was strongly associated with better odor identification, after controlling for multiple factors, the associations with depression and loneliness were unchanged. Clinicians should assess these mental health conditions when treating older patients who present with olfactory deficits.",0
2043,"CONTEXT: Many assume that having poor physical health in old age lowers life satisfaction, but in fact there are large differences in life satisfaction among older people who experience disability. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether psychosocial factors modify the negative association between disability and life satisfaction in older people and whether these differ across the life course. DESIGN: Cross sectional study. SETTING: 66,561 community-dwelling Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) participants aged 50-106 with a mean age of 67.8 ± 9.9 (SD) years from 17 European countries and Israel. METHODS: Psychosocial factors included depression (EURO-D scale), perceived loneliness, having a spouse, having children, contact with children, and participation in social activities. Disability was assessed by limitations in (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) and life satisfaction by Cantril's ladder. We also ran the analyses with the Control Autonomy Self-realization Pleasure (CASP-12) Index, a normative measure of quality of life. We used multiple linear regressions to estimate associations and proportion of variance explained. RESULTS: The variance in life satisfaction that could be attributed uniquely to ADL and IADL disability was 0.17% and 0.33% respectively (both p < 0.001). The impact of (I)ADL disabilities on life satisfaction was strongest at age 50 and gradually decreased with increasing age (p trend < 0.001). Mental health explained more variance; 5.75% for depressive symptoms and 2.50% for loneliness and for social resources this ranged from 0.09% to 0.47% (all p < 0.001). While disability has a negative effect on life satisfaction, the effect was not stronger in older persons who were depressed, neither in those who felt lonely nor in those without social resources. Similar outcomes were found when using CASP-12 as the explained variable. CONCLUSION: The impact of (I)ADL disabilities on life satisfaction in community-dwelling older people decreases with age. These associations are not affected by psychosocial factors and these patterns cannot be explained by people changing their norms and values.",0
2045,"Les clients qui reçoivent des soins de longue durée à domicile résident principalement en foyers privés ou en résidences pour personnes âgées, et le type d'établissement peut influencer les facteurs de risque associés au placement en centres de soins de longue durée. La présente étude analytique multi-états se base sur les données de RAI-Home Care et les données administratives du Hamilton Niagara Haldimand Brant Local Health Integration Network pour modéliser les états de risque conceptualisés dans les conditions initiales et au cours d'une période de suivi de 13 mois. Les facteurs de risque modifiables dans ces états étaient la solitude et les symptômes dépressifs du client, ainsi que la détresse du soignant. Dans les cas où le risque était considéré plus faible, la probabilité rajustée d'une sortie due au décès était plus élevée dans les résidences pour personnes âgées. Suivant les ajustements associés aux caractéristiques des clients, des services et des soignants, il est apparu que le fait de résider dans une résidence pour personnes âgées était associé à une probabilité plus élevée de : 1) placement dans un centre de soins de longue durée, 2) réduction de la détresse des aidants et 3) augmentation de la solitude ou de la dépression des clients. Les résidences pour personnes âgées représentent une solution de rechange aux foyers privés pour les clients nécessitant des soins à domicile de longue durée. Toutefois, les résidences pour personnes âgées impliquent des concessions pour le client et l'aidant naturel. Long-stay home care clients mostly reside in private homes or retirement homes, and the type of residence may influence risk factors for long-term care placement. This multi-state analytic study uses RAI-Home Care and administrative data from the Hamilton Niagara Haldimand Brant Local Health Integration Network to model conceptualized states of risk at baseline through a 13-month follow-up period. Modifiable risk factors in these states were client loneliness or depressive symptoms, and caregiver distress. A higher adjusted likelihood of being discharged deceased was found for the lowest-risk clients in retirement homes. Adjusting for client, service, and caregiver characteristics, retirement home residency was associated with higher likelihood of placement in a long-term care home; reduced caregiver distress; and increased client loneliness/depression. As an alternative to private home settings as the location for aging in place among these long-stay home care clients, retirement home residency represents some trade-offs between client and informal caregiver.",0
2046,"OBJECTIVES: We examined differences in depressive symptoms among people 65 and older who live alone, exploring whether these differences are associated with both health and environmental contexts. METHOD: Data are from the 2006 wave of Health Retirement Study (N = 2,956, age range: 65-104). We used a two-step cluster analytical approach to identify subgroups of health-limitation profiles and environmental profiles. Logistic regression models determined associations between subgroups and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Cluster analysis identified four health-profile subgroups (sensory-cognitively impaired, physically impaired, multiply impaired, and healthy) and three different physical-social environmental-profile subgroups (physically average/socially unsupported, physically unsupported/socially supported, and physically supported/socially above average). Compared to members of healthier groups, members of the multiply impaired group were the oldest and were more likely both to live in senior housing and to have depressive symptoms if they lived in a physically average/socially unsupported environment. Members of the sensory-cognitively impaired group were more likely to have depressive symptoms when they lived in a physically unsupported/socially supported environment. DISCUSSION: Findings regarding the range of both health and social-physical environmental profiles as well as the associations between person-environment profiles combinations (fit) and depressive symptomatology have important policy and intervention implications.",0
2047,"The present study examined whether endorsing a felt-age that is extremely divergent from one's actual age (whether older or younger) is related to worse functioning four years later. Data were drawn from 4938 participants, who completed the 2008 and 2012 questionnaires of the Health-and-Retirement-Study (HRS). Participants were divided into four groups according to their reported proportional-felt-age: the normative-young (N = 2229), reported a normative felt-age at the median or younger; normative-old (N = 2226), reported normative felt-age at the median and older; and the extremely young and extremely old proportional-felt-age (upper and lower 5% of felt-age; N's = 242 and 241, respectively). These groups were compared on chronic medical conditions, depressive symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), functional limitations, and loneliness. While extremely younger proportional-felt-age participants did not reveal worse (or better) outcomes compared with the normative-young group, extremely old proportional-felt-age participants reported worse physical health, mental health, and functioning in cross-sectional, as well as longitudinal comparisons. Extreme values of older proportional-felt-age are usually not reported randomly and reflect less adaptive adjustment. The findings underscore the importance of studying participants at the extreme values of felt-age, especially extreme old proportional-felt-age, and the need for further inspection of the mechanisms underlying these evaluations.",0
2048,"INTRODUCTION: For many rural Canadians nursing care is the primary and often the sole access point to health care. As such, rural nurses are an invaluable resource to the health and wellbeing of rural populations. However, due to a nursing workforce that is aging and retiring, limited resources and support, healthcare reform issues, and other factors, these rural professionals are in short supply. Because of limited opportunities to learn about rural practice settings, nursing students may be reluctant to select rural practice locations. Relevant and effective educational initiatives are needed to attract nursing students to underserved rural and remote communities so that rural people receive the health care they require. The purpose of this study was to explore the use of the innovative research approach called photovoice as an educational strategy to foster learning about and interest in rural locations and rural nursing as future practice settings. Fostering of interest in rural may help to address nursing workforce shortages in rural settings. METHODS: Thirty-eight third and fourth year nursing and health sciences students enrolled in an elective 'Rural Nursing' course used the qualitative research method photovoice to take photographs that represented challenges and facilitators of rural nursing practice. They then engaged in written reflection about their photos. Photos were to be taken in rural settings of their choice, thus fostering both urban and rural student exposure to diverse rural communities. RESULTS: One hundred forty-four photos and reflections were submitted, representing students' appreciation of diverse facilitators and challenges to rural nursing practice. Facilitators included technology, a generalist role, strong sense of community, and slower pace of life. Challenges included inadequate rural education in undergraduate nursing programs, professional isolation, safety issues, few opportunities for professional development, lack of anonymity, and insider/outsider status. Exemplar photos and reflections are provided. CONCLUSIONS: The photovoice research approach used in this rural education endeavour proved to be very useful in fostering students' exposure to, interest in, and understanding of rural settings and their influence on rural nursing practice. Photovoice is also recommended for use in rural courses other than nursing. Suggested strategies include group photovoice experience and the expansion of reflection to enhance rural health research.",0
2049,"Importance: The prevalence of depressive symptoms among older adults has become an increasingly important public health priority. Elevated depressive symptoms are well documented among elderly people with cardiovascular disease (CVD), but studies conducted among Chinese adults are scarce. Objective: To estimate the association between depressive symptoms and incident CVD among middle-aged and older Chinese adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study is an ongoing nationally representative prospective cohort study that was initiated in 2011. This cohort study included 12 417 middle-aged and older Chinese adults without heart disease and stroke at baseline. Statistical analysis was conducted from April 25, 2018, to December 13, 2018. Exposure: Depressive symptoms were assessed using the validated 10-item of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident CVD (ie, self-reported physician-diagnosed heart disease and stroke combined) was followed-up from June 1, 2011, to June 31, 2015. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale total score ranges from 0 to 30, with a score of 12 or more indicating elevated depressive symptoms. Results: Of the 12 417 participants (mean [SD] age at baseline, 58.40 [9.51] years), 6113 (49.2%) were men. During the 4 years of follow-up, 1088 incident CVD cases were identified. Elevated depressive symptoms were independently associated with an increased CVD risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.22-1.58) after adjusting for age, sex, residence, marital status, educational level, smoking status, drinking status, systolic blood pressure, and body mass index; history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic kidney disease; and use of hypertension medications, diabetes medications, and lipid-lowering therapy. Of the 10 individual depressive symptoms measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, only 2 symptoms, restless sleep (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06-1.39) and loneliness (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.44), were significantly associated with incident CVD. Conclusions and Relevance: Elevated depressive symptoms overall and 2 individual symptoms (restless sleep and loneliness) were significantly associated with incident CVD among middle-aged and older Chinese adults.",0
2050,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to (i) investigate age and loneliness, (ii) investigate the association between religiosity and loneliness, and (iii) and explore the relationship between social capital and loneliness. BACKGROUND: Loneliness is the subjective experience of social isolation and is a risk factor for a wide range of health problems including heart disease and depression. Poor self-rated health, domestic violence and poor economic conditions are associated with greater loneliness. DESIGN: The study was a cross-sectional survey of a random sample of adults aged 18 years and over. METHODS: A random sample of 1289 subjects was interviewed by computer-assisted telephone interviewing. This interview included the Loneliness Scale and items from the Social Capital Module of the General Household Survey. FINDINGS: Loneliness is more common in men and people without strong religious beliefs. An income-loneliness gradient is evident. Little support was found for the association between social capital and loneliness. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of loneliness is relatively stable in this population. Loneliness is linked to income and unemployment and as such pathways between socio-economic factors, loneliness and health need to guide interventions and future research. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Loneliness is linked to a range of social and economic factors. Current Health Visiting practice recognizes the importance of tackling the effects of poverty and social deprivation and places community building at the core of much Health Visiting practice. This broad community level approach can usefully transfer into all community nursing and health promotion activity.",0
2051,"Guided by the Person-Environment Fit perspective, we investigated the extent to which personal and environmental factors influence depression among community-dwelling adults. The data came from the special section about community-based service utilization in the 2012 Health and Retirement Study (N=1,710). Although community-based service was not significantly associated with depression after controlling for covariates, respondents with functional limitations and living alone were less likely to be depressed when using community-based services. This study demonstrates the different associations between community-based services and depression depending on personal needs. It discusses the importance of community-based services for aging-in-place policy, particularly among vulnerable populations.",0
2052,"The social participation and integration of older adults are important aspects of healthy aging. However, in general, older adults have smaller social networks than their younger counterparts due to changes in their life cycle stage, such as retirement or age-related losses, along with a declining health and increasing mobility limitations. Consequently, with increasing age, an increasing proportion of older people experience feelings of loneliness and social isolation. Previous studies that have analyzed the relationships between loneliness, social networks, and the living environment have often been based on bivariate relationships or included only a limited number of variables. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze multiple relationships in a more comprehensive framework. Data were collected using a survey among 182 adults aged 65 years and over in the Netherlands. A Bayesian belief network (BBN) modeling approach was used that derives all direct and indirect relationships between the variables. The results showed that feelings of loneliness are directly related to satisfaction with one's social network and neighborhood attachment and are indirectly related to perceived safety and satisfaction with local amenities and services. This knowledge is relevant to urban planners and policy makers who focus on creating livable and healthy social neighborhoods for the aging population.",0
2053,"OBJECTIVES: This paper looks into the socioeconomic determinants of risk of harmful alcohol drinking and of the transitions between risk categories over time among the population aged 50 or over in England. SETTING: Community-dwellers across England. PARTICIPANTS: Respondents to the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing, waves 4 and 5. RESULTS: (Confidence level at 95% or higher, except when stated): ▸ Higher risk drinking falls with age and there is a non-linear association between age and risk for men, peaking in their mid-60s. ▸ Retirement and income are positively associated with a higher risk for women but not for men. ▸ Education and smoking are positively associated for both sexes. ▸ Loneliness and depression are not associated. ▸ Caring responsibilities reduce risk among women. ▸ Single, separated or divorced men show a greater risk of harmful drinking (at 10% confidence level). ▸ For women, being younger and having a higher income at baseline increase the probability of becoming a higher risk alcohol drinker over time. ▸ For men, not eating healthily, being younger and having a higher income increase the probability of becoming a higher risk alcohol drinker. Furthermore, the presence of children living in the household, being lonely, being older and having a lower income are associated with ceasing to be a higher risk alcohol drinker over time. CONCLUSIONS: Several socioeconomic factors found to be associated with high-risk alcohol consumption behaviour among older people would align with those promoted by the 'successful ageing' policy framework.",0
2054,"Health care leaders and providers have introduced the assumption the typical elder, even in the presence of complex, chronic disease and prevailing illness, is capable of assuming greater personal responsibility for their health care, with a shift from provider-centered to a person-centered model of care. For older adults who often and repeatedly face challenges managing and maintaining their health status, guidance and support is needed. In this study, COLLAGE 360, a comprehensive assessment system and wellness coaching program that focuses on prevention and wellness, care coordination and self-management of health care was implemented in one continuing care retirement community. Following completion of two assessment tools via directed conversation with a wellness coach, older adults developed an individualized vitality plan that outlined life goals, supporting goals and action plans for goal achievement. Results from this program suggest engagement in the assessment and wellness coaching process via the COLLAGE 360 program translated into sample older adults sensing that they live in a more supportive environment when compared with elders not receiving any wellness coaching. In addition, the older adults had positive effects in the areas of mood, loneliness, social interaction, health status, and life satisfaction. Strategies to improve health and well being need an extended focus beyond the older adult's medical conditions and consider psychological, spiritual and social needs with personal preferences being paramount. These issues are foundational to a person-centered, health promotion approach needed among this population.",0
2055,"Population-based studies on Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization are scarce. We examined the prevalence, resistance, and molecular diversity of S. aureus in the general population in Northeast Germany. Nasal swabs were obtained from 3,891 adults in the large-scale population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-TREND). Isolates were characterized using spa genotyping, as well as antibiotic resistance and virulence gene profiling. We observed an S. aureus prevalence of 27.2%. Nasal S. aureus carriage was associated with male sex and inversely correlated with age. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 0.95% of the colonizing S. aureus strains. MRSA carriage was associated with frequent visits to hospitals, nursing homes, or retirement homes within the previous 24 months. All MRSA strains were resistant to multiple antibiotics. Most MRSA isolates belonged to the pandemic European hospital-acquired MRSA sequence type 22 (HA-MRSA-ST22) lineage. We also detected one livestock-associated MRSA ST398 (LA-MRSA-ST398) isolate, as well as six livestock-associated methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (LA-MSSA) isolates (clonal complex 1 [CC1], CC97, and CC398). spa typing revealed a diverse but also highly clonal S. aureus population structure. We identified a total of 357 spa types, which were grouped into 30 CCs or sequence types. The major seven CCs (CC30, CC45, CC15, CC8, CC7, CC22, and CC25) included 75% of all isolates. Virulence gene patterns were strongly linked to the clonal background. In conclusion, MSSA and MRSA prevalences and the molecular diversity of S. aureus in Northeast Germany are consistent with those of other European countries. The detection of HA-MRSA and LA-MRSA within the general population indicates possible transmission from hospitals and livestock, respectively, and should be closely monitored.",0
2056,"There is a lack of studies investigating whether loneliness predicts subsequent use of flu vaccination. Therefore, we aimed to clarify this relationship. Data were drawn from two waves (second wave took place in 2002, third wave took place in 2008) of a nationally representative cohort of community-dwelling individuals in Germany. The sample was restricted to individuals ≥60 years for whom flu vaccination is recommended. Loneliness was quantified using the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (second wave). Flu vaccination in the past 12 months was assessed (third wave). Consequently, older individuals that participated in the second wave and reported flu vaccination in the third wave were included (n = 970). The other waves (e.g., first wave) were excluded for reasons of data availability. Increased loneliness was associated with subsequent decreased use of the flu vaccine. Moreover, the probability of flu vaccination in the third wave was positively associated with being retired (ref.: employed), having a lower income, and the number of physical illnesses in the second wave. Findings stressed the importance of loneliness in the decreased use of the flu vaccine. Preventing loneliness may also help to increase flu vaccination rates.",0

Demographic trends imply a substantial increase in both the need and demand for dental care by the senior age groups. A proposal to integrate oral health and dental care with primary care is provided.",0
2058,"The concentrations of bacterial and fungal bioaerosols were measured in a retirement home and a school dormitory from May 2012 to May 2013. In the present work, two active and passive methods were used for bioaerosol sampling. The results from the present work indicated that Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. were the dominant bacterial genera, while the major fungal genera were Penicillium spp., Cladosporium spp., and Aspergillus spp. The results also indicated that the indoor-to-outdoor (I/O) ratios for total bacteria were 1.77 and 1.44 in the retirement home and the school dormitory, respectively; the corresponding values for total fungal spores were 1.23 and 1.08. The results suggested that in addition to outdoor sources, indoor sources also played a significant role in emitting bacterial and fungal bioaerosols in the retirement home and the school dormitory indoor.",0
2059,"Social isolation and loneliness are known to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, reducing social isolation and loneliness may improve such outcomes. In relation to men's health, ""Men's Sheds"" have been shown as one mechanism to achieve this. Studies in Australia and England have shown social, health and personal benefits; however, this remains an area that has not yet been researched in Scotland. This study, therefore, aimed to assess the characteristics of attendees, self-reported motivations for and the values and benefits of attending the Shed from the views of the attendees themselves. The participants of the study were the members of a Men's Shed in the North of Scotland, which was initially set-up by a small number of core Shedders. A convenience sample was recruited by opportunistic interviewing of participants when they attended the Shed using a mixed methods approach from 1 to 15 November 2016. In the absence of a validated questionnaire, a bespoke questionnaire was developed in several iterative stages. The answers to the questionnaire were transferred to an electronic database and analysed by frequency and thematic analysis. The participants (n = 31) had a mean age (SD) of 69.7 ± 9.5 with 96.8% being retired, thus the majority of the Shed users were older and retired. The results suggest that there were several benefits from attending the Shed, with an overwhelming majority of the sample reporting personal, social and health benefits-however, more research is needed to determine the magnitude of these. This study has also shown that the men attending the Shed frequently discussed health, which could potentially have a beneficial effect. The Shed therefore, as a community project, has the potential to have a positive impact on health welfare by focusing on the social aspects of life.",0
2060,"BACKGROUND: Although historically the focus has been placed above all on hospital infections and travel-associated outbreaks, most of the cases of Legionella infection are sporadic and occur in community-dwellers. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the presence and load of Legionella in hot water systems of non-healthcare facilities that host closed communities. Furthermore, we tried to verify the association between Heterotrophic Plate Counts (HPCs) and presence of Legionella. METHODS: We collected hot water and biofilm samples from the showerheads of retirement homes and group homes. Samples were tested by culture method for the presence of Legionella. Confirmation and identification were carried out through Latex test and PCR. We determined the HPCs at 22 and 37 °C by the pour plate method. Statistics performed through STATA. RESULTS: We collected 140 hot water and biofilm samples, 95 from 26 retirement homes and 35 from 9 group homes. Legionella was found in 36.8% samples collected from retirement homes and only in 10.3% group homes' samples (p = 0.01). Legionella was identified more frequently in water than in biofilm (29.8% vs 16.9%); just in one case the pathogen was found in the biofilm only. L. pneumophila sg 1 was the pathogen more frequently isolated (65.8%), with an average load of 2720 CFU/L (SD = 8393 CFU/L). We have often noticed a high microbial contamination (67% of HPCs >200 CFU/mL) and identified a higher prevalence of Legionella for intermediate values of HPC 22 °C (p = 0.011). 32% of people hosted in retirement homes were exposed to Legionella. CONCLUSIONS: Colonization of water-systems of retirement homes and group homes is anything but occasional, and in our survey it mainly affects the former, moreover often due to L. pneumophila sg 1. The search for the pathogen in the biofilm has proved to be of little use. The relationship between HPC and Legionella deserves further studies.",0
2061,"BACKGROUND: Chronic social adversity activates a conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) marked by increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes and decreased expression of antiviral- and antibody-related genes. Recent findings suggest that some psychological resilience factors may help buffer CTRA activation, but the relative impact of resilience and adversity factors remains poorly understood. Here we examined the relative strength of CTRA association for the two best-established psychological correlates of CTRA gene expression-the risk factor of perceived social isolation (loneliness) and the resilience factor of eudaimonic well-being (purpose and meaning in life). METHODS: Peripheral blood samples and validated measures of loneliness and eudaimonic well-being were analyzed in 108 community-dwelling older adults participating in the longitudinal US Health and Retirement Study (56% female, mean age 73). Mixed effect linear model analyses quantified the strength of association between CTRA gene expression and measures of loneliness and eudaimonic well-being in separate and joint analyses. RESULTS: As in previous studies, separate analyses found CTRA gene expression to be up-regulated in association with loneliness and down-regulated in association with eudaimonic well-being. In joint analyses, effects of loneliness were completely abrogated whereas eudaimonic well-being continued to associate with CTRA down-regulation. Similar eudaimonia-dominant effects were observed for positive and negative affect, optimism and pessimism, and anxiety symptoms. All results were independent of demographic and behavioral health risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Eudaimonic well-being may have the potential to compensate for the adverse impact of loneliness on CTRA gene expression. Findings suggest a novel approach to targeting the health risks associated with social isolation by promoting purpose and meaning in life.",0
2062,"PURPOSE: We examine the relationship between the perceived needs and assessed needs of community-dwelling seniors. DESIGN AND METHODS: Trained research assistants administered the Naturally Occurring Retirement Community Baseline Survey to 268 community-dwelling older adults in suburban Maryland. Perceived and assessed needs were measured in the domains of health and function (memory, health, functional needs, mobility, and financial management), mental health (depression and loneliness), sensory functioning (vision), and health behaviors (nutrition and exercise). RESULTS: In the areas of functional needs, mobility, financial management, loneliness, and vision, persons who scored as more needy were already utilizing significantly more services. Of persons not receiving services, participants in need of memory, physical health, functional, loneliness, and nutrition services were more likely to indicate they would use those services. Although there were significant relationships between assessed needs and perceived needs, there was also a high level of discrepancy, such that a substantial proportion of those participants screened as not needing services requested those services, and a sizable proportion of those who screened as needing services did not request them. The results also show a high prevalence of needs among older adults and yet low service use by those with needs for these services. IMPLICATIONS: Both assessed and perceived needs should be examined in future need assessment surveys. Further investigations into the nature of discrepancies will likely result in improvement in the methodologies of screening assessed and perceived needs. Services targeted to older adults must be made more available to those dwelling in the community.",0
2063,"BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis in elderly adults are reported infrequently but are often caused by G2P[4] strains. In 2011, outbreaks were reported in 2 Illinois retirement facilities. OBJECTIVE: To implement control measures, determine the extent and severity of illness, and assess risk factors for disease among residents and employees. DESIGN: Cohort studies using surveys and medical chart abstraction. SETTING: Two large retirement facilities in Cook County, Illinois. PATIENTS: Residents and employees at both facilities and community residents with rotavirus disease. MEASUREMENTS: Attack rates, hospitalization rates, and rotavirus genotype. RESULTS: At facility A, 84 of 324 residents (26%) were identified with clinical or laboratory-confirmed rotavirus gastroenteritis (median age, 84 years) and 11 (13%) were hospitalized. The outbreak lasted 7 weeks. At facility B, 90 case patients among 855 residents (11%) were identified (median age, 88 years) and 19 (21%) were hospitalized. The facility B outbreak lasted 9.3 weeks. Ill employees were identified at both locations. In each facility, attack rates seemed to differ by residential setting, with the lowest rates among those in more separated settings or with high baseline level of infection control measures. The causative genotype for both outbreaks was G2P[4]. Some individuals shed virus detected by enzyme immunoassay or genotyping reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for at least 35 days. G2P[4] was also identified in 17 of 19 (89%) samples from the older adult community but only 15 of 40 (38%) pediatric samples. LIMITATION: Medical or cognitive impairment among residents limited the success of some interviews. CONCLUSION: Rotavirus outbreaks can occur among elderly adults in residential facilities and can result in considerable morbidity. Among older adults, G2P[4] may be of unique importance. Health professionals should consider rotavirus as a cause of acute gastroenteritis in adults. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.",0
2064,"Palm Springs, CA, is a retirement community with the highest prevalence of gay men living with HIV older than 50 years in the United States. Through a community-academic partnership, we explored the major health issues, resiliencies, and priority research topics related to HIV and aging. We conducted five community facilitated focus groups with different stakeholders, including two focus groups with older adults living with HIV, one with their caregivers, one with HIV-focused community-based organizations, and a joint focus group with researchers and HIV care providers. Using the rigorous and accelerated data reduction technique, five major themes emerged, which included long-term side effects of medication, social determinants of health, mental health, resiliencies, and involving community in research. These data are important for developing effective interventions, conducting useful and impactful research, and providing health care providers with the tools and knowledge to provide optimal care.",0
2065,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate pneumococcal immunization in older adults living in retirement communities and to measure nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae to better assess the potential for herd protection from the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) in these settings. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study of adults aged 65 and older living in retirement communities to determine coverage with 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV-23), coverage with PCV-13 in immuncompromised individuals according to 2012 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines, and nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae. SETTING: Two retirement communities in North Carolina. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults recruited between December 2013 and April 2014 (N = 21, 64.8% female, mean age 81.4). MEASUREMENTS: A survey was used to assess chronic illnesses, immunization history, and potential risk factors for pneumococcal carriage; a chart review was used to confirm immunization history and abstract chronic conditions; and a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and cultured for S. pneumoniae. RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of participants reported receiving PPSV-23 since age 65. Of the 16.2% of participants with an immunocompromising condition, only one had received PCV-13. Nasopharyngeal carriage with S. pneumoniae was detected in 1.9% (95% confidence interval = 0.0-3.8%) of participants. CONCLUSION: In this select sample, PPSV-23 coverage was high, but adherence to the ACIP recommendation for PCV-13 in immunocompromised groups was low. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae was present, although infrequent, suggesting that immunization with PCV-13 could provide an individual benefit and a small degree of herd protection.",0
2066,"BACKGROUND: Household help is a community intervention in the Netherlands. Its primary goal is to provide professional help in doing domestic work. A secondary goal of the intervention is to alleviate loneliness. In 2007, a major health care reform and budget cut changed household help. After the reform alleviating loneliness is no longer an aim of the intervention. In this study we evaluate the effects of the policy change in household help on loneliness among older adults in the Netherlands. METHODS: We use SHARE data collected during the period 2004-2013 to compare levels of loneliness among older adults in the Netherlands and those in 9 other European countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Italy, France, Sweden, Spain and Switzerland). We use a synthetic control method (SCM) based on aggregate data. To check the robustness of our results we also apply a difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator that allows us to estimate the effects of policy changes using individual level data. RESULTS: In 2004, the prevalence of loneliness ranged between 6.5% in the Netherlands and 15.4% in Italy. Loneliness increased with time for all observed countries. The increase between 2004 and 2013 was highest in France - 30.2%, Italy - 33. 4% and Belgium - 25.0%. The level of loneliness among older adults in the Netherlands increased after 2011. However, it is still lower than in other countries. There was no statistical significant difference in age between waves (67.36 ± 13.7 before 2011 to 68.55 ± 9.24 after 2011, p = 0.01). Based on the DiD estimator, there is no statistically significant difference in the incidence of loneliness between older adults in the Netherlands and those in the control countries. CONCLUSION: Our results do not suggest that the policy change and budget cut in 2007 on household help has had an effect on loneliness. In absolute numbers, the prevalence of loneliness has increased since 2011, however we find no evidence that this can be attributed to the policy change.",0
2067,"BACKGROUND: The demographic, health and contextual factors associated with quality of life impairment are investigated in older persons from New South Wales, Australia. We examine the impact of cardiovascular and affective conditions on impairment and the potential moderating influence of comorbidity and remoteness. METHODS: Data from persons aged 55 and over were drawn from two community cohorts sampling from across urban to very remote areas. Hierarchical linear regressions were used to assess: 1) the impact of cardiovascular and affective conditions on physical and psychological quality of life impairment; and 2) any influence of remoteness on these effects (N = 4364). Remoteness was geocoded to participants at the postal code level. Secondary data sources were used to examine the social capital and health service accessibility correlates of remoteness. RESULTS: Physical impairment was consistently associated with increased age, male gender, lower education, being unmarried, retirement, stroke, heart attack/angina, depression/anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, current obesity and low social support. Psychological impairment was consistently associated with lower age, being unmarried, stroke, heart attack/angina, depression/anxiety and low social support. Remoteness tended to be associated with lower psychological impairment, largely reflecting overall urban versus rural differences. The impacts of cardiovascular and affective conditions on quality of life were not influenced by remoteness. Social capital increased and health service accessibility decreased with remoteness, though no differences between outer-regional and remote/very remote areas were observed. Trends suggested that social capital was associated with lower psychological impairment and that the influence of cardiovascular conditions and social capital on psychological impairment was greater for persons with a history of affective conditions. The beneficial impact of social capital in reducing psychological impairment was more marked for those experiencing financial difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular and affective conditions are key determinants of physical and psychological impairment. Persons affected by physical-psychological comorbidity experience greater psychological impairment. Social capital is associated with community remoteness and may ameliorate the psychological impairment associated with affective disorders and financial difficulties. The use of classifications of remoteness that are sensitive to social and health service accessibility determinants of health may better inform future investigations into the impact of context on quality of life outcomes.",0
2068,"Accounts of drinking water-borne disease outbreaks have always captured the interest of the public, elected and health officials, and the media. During the twentieth century, the drinking water community and public health organizations have endeavored to craft regulations and guidelines on treatment and management practices that reduce risks from drinking water, specifically human pathogens. During this period there also evolved misunderstandings as to potential health risk associated with microorganisms that may be present in drinking waters. These misunderstanding or ""myths"" have led to confusion among the many stakeholders. The purpose of this article is to provide a scientific- and clinically-based discussion of these ""myths"" and recommendations for better ensuring the microbial safety of drinking water and valid public health decisions.",0
2069,"The epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community in Portugal is not completely understood. To evaluate S. aureus and MRSA carriage among the elderly, we conducted a large cross-sectional study between April 2010 and December 2012. A total of 3,361 adults over 60 years of age were screened for S. aureus nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal carriage. MRSA were characterized by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, spa typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and tested for the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). Risk factors for MRSA carriage were identified by multiple logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of S. aureus and MRSA carriage among the elderly was 20.1 % and 1.8 %, respectively. The risk of being an MRSA carrier was higher among the elderly living in retirement homes [odds ratio (OR) = 2.90, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.48-5.48] and those that had been hospitalized in the previous year (OR = 2.64, 95 % CI: 1.47-4.58). Among the 62 MRSA isolates, 64.5 % were multidrug-resistant and none carried PVL. Most MRSA (82.3 %) were related to three hospital-associated (HA-MRSA) clones disseminated in Portugal: ST105-II (New York/Japan clone; 43.5 %), ST5-IVc (Pediatric clone; 19.4 %), and ST22-IVh (EMRSA-15 clone; 19.4 %). The New York/Japan and Pediatric clones were significantly associated with carriers living in retirement homes, while the EMRSA-15 clone was associated with carriers that had been hospitalized. We conclude that the elderly population in Portugal is essentially free of MRSA. Given the current European societal challenges for a healthy active aging, these results are of importance to healthcare professionals and public authorities to decide on strategies to promote health in this age group.",0
2070,"Most older adults prefer to age in place and it is therefore vital to support them in maintaining a high quality of life in their place of residence. Many Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) have implemented services to fulfill a range of needs of their residents. Community Partners (CP) provided 58 NORC residents in six apartment buildings within two suburban neighborhoods in Maryland with health and social work services, activities and transportation services. Participants were compared with 70 residents who did not receive these services. Residents were assessed prior to initiation of services (e.g. transportation, social work and recreation) and after service usage through a membership program. Members had significantly increased satisfaction with recreational activities and social life in the community as well as significant decreases in depressed affect. Members' self-reports showed that they were more likely to get out of the house, felt less isolated, and were happier since joining CP activities. This study is unique in examining the impact of utilization of a variety of services for older persons, while comparing these individuals to a local group of community-dwelling older persons who are without NORC services.",0
2071,"OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of sociodemographic and clinical factors with cognitive, physical, and mental health among independent living older adults in a continuing care senior housing community (CCSHC). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study at the independent living sector of a CCSHC in San Diego County, California. Participants included English-speaking adults aged 65-95 years, of which two-thirds were women. Of the 112 subjects recruited, 104 completed basic study assessments. The authors computed composite measures of cognitive, physical, and mental health. The authors also assessed relevant clinical correlates including psychosocial factors such as resilience, loneliness, wisdom, and social support. RESULTS: The CCSHC residents were similar to a randomly selected community-based sample of older adults on most standardized clinical measures. In the CCSHC, physical health correlated with both cognitive function and mental health, but there was no significant correlation between cognitive and mental health. Cognitive function was significantly associated with physical mobility, satisfaction with life, and wisdom, whereas physical health was associated with age, self-rated physical functioning, mental well-being, and resilience. Mental health was significantly associated with income, optimism, self-compassion, loneliness, and sleep disturbances. CONCLUSION: Different psychosocial factors are significantly associated with cognitive, physical, and mental health. Longitudinal studies of diverse samples of older adults are necessary to determine risk factors and protective factors for specific domains of health. With rapidly growing numbers of older adults who require healthcare as well as supportive housing, CCSHCs will become increasingly important sites for studying and promoting the health of older adults.",0
2072,"OBJECTIVES: The number of older people choosing to relocate to retirement villages (RVs) is increasing rapidly. This choice is often a way to decrease social isolation while still living independently. Loneliness is a significant health issue and contributes to overall frailty, yet RV resident loneliness is poorly understood. Our aim is to describe the prevalence of loneliness and associated factors in a New Zealand RV population. DESIGN: A resident survey was used to collect demographics, social engagement, loneliness, and function, as well as a comprehensive geriatric assessment (international Resident Assessment Instrument [interRAI]) as part of the ""Older People in Retirement Villages Study."" SETTING: RVs, Auckland, New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included RV residents living in 33 RVs (n = 578). MEASUREMENTS: Two types of recruitment: randomly sampled cohort (n = 217) and volunteer sample (n = 361). Independently associated factors for loneliness were determined through multiple logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Of the participants, 420 (72.7%) were female, 353 (61.1%) lived alone, with the mean age of 81.3 years. InterRAI assessment loneliness (yes/no question) was 25.8% (n = 149), and the resident survey found that 37.4% (n = 216) feel lonely sometimes/often/always. Factors independently associated with interRAI loneliness included being widowed (adjusted OR 8.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.15-16.48), being divorced/separated/never married (OR 4.76; 95% CI 2.15-10.54), poor/fair quality of life (OR 3.37; 95% CI 1.43-7.94), moving to an RV to gain more social connections (OR 1.55; 95% CI 0.99-2.43), and depression risk (medium risk: OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.53-4.35; high risk: OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.47-11.95). CONCLUSION: A considerable proportion of older people living in RVs reported feelings of loneliness, particularly those who were without partners, at risk of depression and decreased quality of life and those who had moved into RVs to increase social connections. Early identification of factors for loneliness in RV residents could support interventions to improve quality of life and positively impact RV resident health and well-being.",0
2073,"BACKGROUND: Friends provide acceptance, companionship, emotional support, and are important to mental health. One reason that older adults give for seeking alternative accommodations is to reduce their loneliness and isolation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether older adults living in a retirement village have varying amounts of contact with friends who live within the retirement village or in the wider community. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-three independently living residents of 25 retirement village sites were interviewed. Participants were asked a range of open and closed questions about the amount and kind of contact they had with co-resident friends and community-based friends. RESULTS: Residents engaged in several weekly visits with village friends and maintained regular contact with community friends through telephone calls. Few residents engaged in community outings or participated in village activities with either village or community friends. CONCLUSION: The nature of living in close proximity with other people, influences the amount of informal contact they have with friends. For those older individuals who seek alternative accommodation due to isolation or loneliness, re-location to congregate-style accommodation may increase their social contacts and have a positive impact on their well-being.",0
2074,"Objective: Older adults are at a high risk for loneliness, which impacts their health, well-being, and longevity. While related to social isolation, loneliness is a distinct, internally experienced, distressing feeling. The present qualitative study sought to identify characteristics of loneliness in older adults living independently within a senior housing community, which is typically designed to reduce social isolation.Method: Semi-structured qualitative interviews regarding the experience of loneliness, risk factors, and ways to combat it were conducted with 30 older adults, ages 65-92 years. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded using a grounded theory analytic approach based on coding, consensus, co-occurrence, and comparison.Results: Three main themes with multiple subthemes are described: (A) Risk and Protective factors for loneliness: age-associated losses, lack of social skills or abilities, and protective personality traits; (B) Experience of loneliness: Sadness and lack of meaning as well as Lack of motivation; and (C) Coping strategies to prevent or overcome loneliness: acceptance of aging, compassion, seeking companionship, and environment enables socialization.Discussion: Despite living within a communal setting designed to reduce social isolation, many older adults described feeling lonely in stark negative terms, attributing it to aging-associated losses or lack of social skills and abilities. However, interviewees also reported positive personal qualities and actions to prevent or cope with loneliness, several of which mirrored specific components of wisdom. The results support the reported inverse relationship between loneliness and wisdom and suggest a potential role for wisdom-enhancing interventions to reduce and prevent loneliness in older populations.",0
2075,"Background and Objectives: The present study compares how 2 settings: adult day care centers (ADCCs) and continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) fare with regard to loneliness and anxiety about aging. Loneliness is a highly prevalent and distressing subjective experience of inadequate social relations, which has negative effects on health and well-being. Anxiety about aging is defined as worries brought up by imagining the negative consequences and losses associated with old age. The study also examines whether anxiety about aging accounts for differences in loneliness between the 2 settings. This study took place in Israel, where ADCCs are funded by the National Insurance Institute of Israel and CCRCs tend to be funded by private income and wealth. Despite notable differences between the settings, a common goal of both is to reduce loneliness among older adults. Research Design and Methods: A cross-sectional design of 4 ADCCs and 4 CCRCs (N = 456). Results: Compared with CCRC residents, older adults in ADCCs reported higher levels of loneliness (Mean [SD] = 1.46 [0.60], Mean [SD] = 1.78 [0.80], respectively, t [df]= -5.10 [448], p < .001) and higher levels of anxiety about aging (Mean [SD] = 2.96 [0.88], Mean [SD] = 3.27 [0.99], respectively, t [df] = -3.42 [440], p < .001). Anxiety about aging partially accounted for the differences between the 2 settings in levels of loneliness (B = 0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0037-0.0651). Discussion and Implications: Although it is not possible to determine causality from this cross-sectional design, it is possible that CCRCs provide a better social outlet for older adults than ADCCs.",0
2076,"Many Indian COVID-19 suicide cases are turning the press-media attention and flooding in the social media platforms although, no particular studies assessed the COVID-19 suicide causative factors to a large extent. Therefore, the present study presents 69 COVID-19 suicide cases (aged 19 to 65 years; 63 cases were males). The suicide causalities are included as follows - fear of COVID-19 infection (n=21), followed by financial crisis (n=19), loneliness, social boycott and pressure to be quarantine, COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 work-related stress, unable to come back home due to lockdown, unavailability of alcohol etc. Considering the extreme psychological impacts related to COVID-19, there emerges a need for countrywide extensive tele-mental health care services.",0
2077,"OBJECTIVE: The study examined whether subjective age moderated the relationship between loneliness due to the COVID-19 pandemic and psychiatric symptoms. METHODS: A convenience sample of older adult Israelis (N = 277, mean age = 69.58 ± 6.72) completed web-based questionnaires comprising loneliness, anxiety, depressive, and peritraumatic distress symptoms. They also reported how old they felt. RESULTS: The positive relationship between loneliness due to the COVID-19 pandemic and psychiatric symptoms was weak among those who felt younger than their age while this very same relationship was robust among those feeling older. CONCLUSIONS: Young subjective age may weaken the loneliness-symptom association among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults holding an older age identity are more susceptible to the adverse effects of loneliness. Although preliminary, the findings may inform screening and interventions. Subjective age may help identify those at high risk in suffering from loneliness, and suggest interventions aimed at ameliorating both loneliness and older subjective ages.",0
2078,"This study sought to identify factors associated with depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology in U.S. young adults (18-30 years) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional online study assessed 898 participants from April 13, 2020 to May 19, 2020, approximately one month after the U.S. declared a state of emergency due to COVID-19 and prior to the initial lifting of restrictions across 50 U.S. states. Respondents reported high levels of depression (43.3%, PHQ-8 scores ≥ 10), high anxiety scores (45.4%, GAD-7 scores ≥ 10), and high levels of PTSD symptoms (31.8%, PCL-C scores ≥ 45). High levels of loneliness, high levels of COVID-19-specific worry, and low distress tolerance were significantly associated with clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Resilience was associated with low levels of depression and anxiety symptoms but not PTSD. Most respondents had high levels of social support; social support from family, but not from partner or peers, was associated with low levels of depression and PTSD. Compared to Whites, Asian Americans were less likely to report high levels across mental health symptoms, and Hispanic/Latinos were less likely to report high levels of anxiety. These factors provide initial guidance regarding the clinical management for COVID-19-related mental health problems.",0
2079,"In response to Voitsidis et al. (2020) published in Psychiatry Research addressing the paucity of research on insomnia during a pandemic, we obtained data from an online cross-sectional survey by documenting the prevalence of clinical insomnia and its contributing factors in a French general public sample. Participants (N = 556) completed the Insomnia Severity Index, UCLA Loneliness scale, and provided information on sociodemographics, antecedents of mental and physical health conditions, and COVID-19-related stressful life events. In our sample, 19.1% met the diagnostic criteria of clinical insomnia, which was twice lower than that reported in the study by Voitsidis et al., but close to those found among Chinese and Italian populations. We confirmed COVID-19-related worries and loneliness to be the major contributing factors to clinical insomnia, in addition to education status, being infected by the virus and pre-existing mental health illness. These findings underscore that sleep-related problems should be an important component of mental health interventions during pandemics.",0
2081,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most communities in the United States imposed stay-at-home orders to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus, potentially leading to chronic social isolation. During the third week of shelter-in-place guidelines, 1,013 U.S. adults completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale-3 and Public Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Loneliness was elevated, with 43% of respondents scoring above published cutoffs, and was strongly associated with greater depression and suicidal ideation. Loneliness is a critical public health concern that must be considered during the social isolation efforts to combat the pandemic.",0
2082,"The pandemic caused by Covid-19 has been an unprecedented social and health emergency worldwide. This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident. In addition, it is possible to identify the need of greater psychological support in general and in certain particularly vulnerable groups.",0
2083,"This multi-wave study examined the extent that both preference and motivation for time alone shapes ill-being during self-isolation. Individuals in the USA and the UK are self-isolating in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Different motivations may drive their self-isolation: some might see value in it (understood as the identified form of autonomous motivation), while others might feel forced into it by authorities or close others (family, friends, neighbourhoods, doctors; the external form of controlled motivation). People who typically prefer company will find themselves spending more time alone, and may experience ill-being uniformly, or as a function of their identified or external motivations for self-isolation. Self-isolation, therefore, offers a unique opportunity to distinguish two constructs coming from disparate literatures. This project examined preference and motivation (identified and external) for solitude, and tested their independent and interacting contributions to ill-being (loneliness, depression and anxiety during the time spent alone) across two weeks. Confirmatory hypotheses regarding preference and motivation were not supported by the data. A statistically significant effect of controlled motivation on change in ill-being was observed one week later, and preference predicted ill-being across two weeks. However, effect sizes for both were below our minimum threshold of interest.",0
2085,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the widespread implementation of extraordinary physical distancing interventions (e.g., stay-at-home orders) to slow the spread of the virus. Although vital, these interventions may be socially and economically disruptive, contributing to adverse psychological outcomes. This study examined relations of both stay-at-home orders and the perceived impact of COVID-19 on daily life to psychological outcomes (depression, health anxiety, financial worry, social support, and loneliness) in a nationwide U.S. community adult sample (N = 500; 47% women, mean age = 40). Participants completed questionnaires assessing psychological outcomes, stay-at-home order status, and COVID-19's impact on their daily life. Being under a stay-at-home order was associated with greater health anxiety, financial worry, and loneliness. Moreover, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on daily life was positively associated with health anxiety, financial worry, and social support, but negatively associated with loneliness. Findings highlight the importance of social connection to mitigate negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
2087,"Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has profound psychological and social effects. The psychological sequelae of the pandemic will probably persist for months and years to come. Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression, and insomnia in the general population and among health care professionals. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress, and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and people who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas. Stress-related psychiatric conditions including mood and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior. COVID-19 survivors may also be at elevated suicide risk. The COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic. Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic. To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population. There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress. Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors, and older adults. Research studies are needed of how mental health consequences can be mitigated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
2088,"Social distancing and ""stay-at-home"" orders are essential to contain the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), but there is concern that these measures will increase feelings of loneliness, particularly in vulnerable groups. The present study examined change in loneliness in response to the social restriction measures taken to control the coronavirus spread. A nationwide sample of American adults (N = 1,545; 45% women; ages 18 to 98, M = 53.68, SD = 15.63) was assessed on three occasions: in late January/early February 2020 (before the outbreak), in late March (during the President's initial ""15 Days to Slow the Spread"" campaign), and in late April (during the ""stay-at-home"" policies of most states). Contrary to expectations, there were no significant mean-level changes in loneliness across the three assessments (d = .04, p > .05). In fact, respondents perceived increased support from others over the follow-up period (d = .19, p < .01). Older adults reported less loneliness overall compared to younger age groups but had an increase in loneliness during the acute phase of the outbreak (d = .14, p < .05). Their loneliness, however, leveled off after the issuance of stay-at-home orders. Individuals living alone and those with at least one chronic condition reported feeling lonelier at baseline but did not increase in loneliness during the implementation of social distancing measures. Despite some detrimental impact on vulnerable individuals, in the present sample, there was no large increase in loneliness but remarkable resilience in response to COVID-19.

2090,"OBJECTIVES: Families are going through a very stressful time because of the COVID-19 outbreak, with age being a risk factor for this illness. Negative self-perceptions of aging, among other personal and relational variables may be associated with loneliness and distress caused by the pandemic crisis. METHOD: Participants are 1310 Spanish people (age range: 18-88 years) during a lock-down period at home. In addition to specific questions about risk for COVID-19, self-perceptions of aging, family and personal resources, loneliness and psychological distress were measured. Hierarchical regression analyses were done for assessing the correlates of loneliness and psychological distress. RESULTS: The measured variables allow for an explanation of 48% and 33% of the variance of distress and loneliness, respectively. Being female, younger, having negative self-perceptions about aging, more time exposed to news about COVID-19, more contact with relatives different to those that co-reside, fewer positive emotions, less perceived self-efficacy, lower quality of sleep, higher expressed emotion and higher loneliness were associated with higher distress. Being female, younger, having negative self-perceptions about aging, more time exposed to news about COVID-19, lower contact with relatives, higher self-perception as a burden, fewer positive emotions, lower resources for entertaining oneself, lower quality of sleep and higher expressed emotion were associated with higher loneliness.",0
2091,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2-causing Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), emerged as a public health threat in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Delirium, a dangerous untoward prognostic development, serves as a barometer of systemic injury in critical illness. The early reports of 25% encephalopathy from China are likely a gross underestimation, which we know occurs whenever delirium is not monitored with a valid tool. Indeed, patients with COVID-19 are at accelerated risk for delirium due to at least seven factors including (1) direct central nervous system (CNS) invasion, (2) induction of CNS inflammatory mediators, (3) secondary effect of other organ system failure, (4) effect of sedative strategies, (5) prolonged mechanical ventilation time, (6) immobilization, and (7) other needed but unfortunate environmental factors including social isolation and quarantine without family. Given early insights into the pathobiology of the virus, as well as the emerging interventions utilized to treat the critically ill patients, delirium prevention and management will prove exceedingly challenging, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). The main focus during the COVID-19 pandemic lies within organizational issues, i.e., lack of ventilators, shortage of personal protection equipment, resource allocation, prioritization of limited mechanical ventilation options, and end-of-life care. However, the standard of care for ICU patients, including delirium management, must remain the highest quality possible with an eye towards long-term survival and minimization of issues related to post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). This article discusses how ICU professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacologists) can use our knowledge and resources to limit the burden of delirium on patients by reducing modifiable risk factors despite the imposed heavy workload and difficult clinical challenges posed by the pandemic.",0
2092,"The zoonotic virus now named SARS-CoV-2 first infected humans in China, and COVID-19 has rapidly become pandemic. To mitigate its impact on societies, health systems and economies, countries have adopted non-pharmacological preventive practices such as 'spatial' or 'social' distancing, the use of protective masks, and handwashing; these have been widely implemented. However, measures aimed at protecting physical health and healthcare systems have side-effects that might have a big impact on individuals' wellbeing. As the pandemic reaches low- and middle-income countries, weaker health systems, limited resources and the lower socioeconomic status of their populations make halting the pandemic more challenging. In this article, we explore the impact of COVID-19 and its prevention measures on the wellbeing of vulnerable populations. Special attention must be given to homeless, indigenous, migrant and imprisoned populations, as well as people living with disabilities and the elderly. More than just resolute governmental action will be required to overcome the pandemic. Links between science and political actions have to be strengthened. Fighting COVID-19 is a collective endeavour and community action, on a global scale, is of paramount importance.",0
2094,"COVID-19 has now been declared a pandemic. To date, COVID-19 has affected over 2.5 million people worldwide, resulting in over 170,000 reported deaths. Numerous preventative strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions have been employed to mitigate the spread of disease including careful infection control, the isolation of patients, and social distancing. Management is predominantly focused on the provision of supportive care, with oxygen therapy representing the major treatment intervention. Medical therapy involving corticosteroids and antivirals have also been encouraged as part of critical management schemes. However, there is at present no specific antiviral recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. Despite the strategic implementation of these measures, the number of new reported cases continues to rise at a profoundly alarming rate. As new findings emerge, there is an urgent need for up-to-date management guidelines. In response to this call, we review what is currently known regarding the management of COVID-19, and offer an evidence-based review of current practice.",0

2097,"Advances in high-resolution ultrasound have provided clinicians with unique opportunities to study diseases of the peripheral nervous system. Ultrasound complements the clinical and electrophysiology exam by showing the degree of abnormalities in myopathies, as well as spontaneous muscle activities in motor neuron diseases and other disorders. In experienced hands, ultrasound is more sensitive than MRI in detecting peripheral nerve pathologies. It can also guide needle placement for electromyography exam, therapeutic injections, and muscle biopsy. Ultrasound enhances the ability to detect carpal tunnel syndrome and other focal nerve entrapment, as well as pathological nerve enlargements in genetic and acquired neuropathies. Furthermore, ultrasound can potentially be used as a biomarker for muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. The combination of electromyography and ultrasound can increase the diagnostic certainty of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, aid in the localization of brachial plexus or peripheral nerve trauma and allow for surveillance of nerve tumor progression in neurofibromatosis. Potential limitations of ultrasound include an inability to image deeper structures, with lower sensitivities in detecting neuromuscular diseases in young children and those with mitochondrial myopathies, due to subtle changes or early phase of the disease. As well, its utility in detecting critical illness neuromyopathy remains unclear. This review will focus on the clinical applications of neuromuscular ultrasound. The diagnostic values of ultrasound for screening of myopathies, neuropathies, and motor neuron diseases will be presented.",0

The multifactorial hormonal, inflammatory, genetic, mental and behavior pathogenesis can result in chronic pelvic pain, blooding disorders and infertility causing disruption of quality of life. Correct diagnosis of the extension and topography is substantial in defining the adequate therapeutic strategy. In an increasing proportion of the cases, endometriosis is being managed medically and para-medically; diagnostic or therapeutic surgery can often be avoided or delayed. Transvaginal sonography is considered being the first-line imaging method in the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis. The paradigm shift from the belief that endometriosis only affects women of reproductive age has drawn attention to endometriosis in both premenarchal and postmenopausal patients. This review resumes the actually recommended ultrasound signs in the case of patients in menstrual age. Specific diagnostic approaches in adolescent and menopausal patients are highlighted.",0
2101,"Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) provides the unique opportunity to visualize, interrogate and intervene gastrointestinal (GI) luminal, mural or peri-luminal structures and pathology with negligible adverse effects. Diagnostic, upper GI and rectal EUS is feasible, extremely safe, and efficacious. Most EUS guided interventions are safe, effective and minimally invasive, compared to peers in the percutaneous radiological or surgical procedures. As with any endoscopic procedure, EUS and its guided interventions may be accompanied by adverse events. EUS related complications are generally infrequent in expert hands, and mainly include bleeding and perforation. However, the nature and severity of adverse events associated with each EUS guided procedure are unique. Hence, it is paramount for endosonographer to have sufficient knowledge of the indications, techniques, and potential risks involved before contemplating any given procedure. Most common intervention with EUS is transmural fine needle aspiration (FNA), which is an extremely safe procedure. EUS guided drainage procedures are rapidly evolving with newer devices and methods being employed. Among them, EUS guided drainage of pancreatic fluid collection-pseudocyst or walled off necrosis (WON), has largely replaced other methods (surgical, percutaneous or non-EUS endoscopic) with acceptable complications. Currently, dedicated metal stents are more widely used compared to plastic stents for drainage of PFC, especially WON. EUS has made a definite impact in biliary access and drainage of obstructed biliary system, in patients where ERCP has failed or is technically not possible, closely competing with percutaneous biliary drainage. In spite of some complications, recent improvement in devices for bilio-enteric fistula creation and stent designs, has added to its safety and efficacy. EUS guided pancreatic duct drainage remains the most challenging of EUS guided interventions where in-roads are being made.",0

Diagnostic chest ultrasound provides accurate diagnosis of conditions that commonly cause ARF, and may improve overall diagnostic accuracy in critical care settings as compared to standard diagnostic approaches. Respiratory physicians are becoming increasingly familiar with ultrasound as a part of routine clinical practice, although the majority of data to date has focused on the emergency and intensive care settings. This review will examine the evidence for the use of diagnostic chest ultrasound, focusing on different levels of imaging efficacy; specifically ultrasound test attributes, impacts on clinician behaviour and impact on health outcomes. The evidence behind use of multi-modality ultrasound examinations in ARF will be reviewed. It is hoped that readers will become familiar with the advantages and potential issues with chest ultrasound, as well as evidence gaps in the field.",0
2103,"Among several ultrasound patterns, thyroid nodule hypoechogenicity, spot microcalcifications, and an absent halo sign are used for predicting increased risk of thyroid malignancy. The predictive value of ultrasound, however, increases at the expense of its sensitivity, and malignancy is predicted with high specificity only when multiple ultrasound features are simultaneously present. Ultrasound features are important in determining the strength of the indication for carrying out fine needle aspiration. To this end, a system for standardization of ultrasound features (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System) aids in establishing risk of malignancy. Ultrasound elastosonography is a technique that assesses hardness as an indicator of malignancy risk. It has been carried out in selected studies of patients with thyroid nodules, and has been shown to have a high predictive value for malignancy, which is also maintained in cytologically indeterminate and non-diagnostic nodules. Although conventional ultrasound maintains its pivotal role in defining which nodules are candidates for ultrasound elastosonography characterization, the latter seems to have considerable potential in the diagnosis, or exclusion, of thyroid cancer. This especially concerns thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology at fine-needle aspiration.",0

2107,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to critically discuss the use of ultrasound in the evaluation of muscle disorders with a particular focus on the emerging use in inflammatory myopathies. RECENT FINDINGS: In myopathies, pathologic muscle shows an increase in echogenicity. Muscle echogenicity can be assessed visually, semi-quantitatively, or quantitatively using grayscale analysis. The involvement of specific muscle groups and the pattern of increase in echogenicity can further point to specific diseases. In pediatric neuromuscular disorders, the value of muscle ultrasound for screening and diagnosis is well-established. It has also been found to be a responsive measure of disease change in muscular dystrophies. In chronic forms of myositis like inclusion body myositis, ultrasound is very suitable for detecting markedly increased echogenicity and atrophy in affected muscles. Acute cases of muscle edema show only a mild increase in echogenicity, which can also reverse with successful treatment. Muscle ultrasound is an important imaging modality that is highly adaptable to study various muscle conditions. Although its diagnostic value for neuromuscular disorders is high, the evidence in myositis has only begun to accrue in earnest. Further systematic studies are needed, especially in its role for detecting muscle edema.",0
2108,"Potential ultrasound exposure safety issues are reviewed, with guidance for prudent use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Safety assurance begins with the training of POCUS practitioners in the generation and interpretation of diagnostically valid and clinically relevant images. Sonographers themselves should minimize patient exposure in accordance with the as-low-as-reasonably-achievable principle, particularly for the safety of the eye, lung, and fetus. This practice entails the reduction of output indices or the exposure duration, consistent with the acquisition of diagnostically definitive images. Informed adoption of POCUS worldwide promises a reduction of ionizing radiation risks, enhanced cost-effectiveness, and prompt diagnoses for optimal patient care.",0
2109,"PURPOSE: Posterior plagiocephaly (PP) is a common clinical condition in pediatric age. There are two main causes of PP: postural plagiocephaly and craniosynostosis. Early diagnosis is important, as it prevents neurological complications and emergencies. Diagnosis in the past was often made late and with imaging tests that subjected the infant to a high radiation load. Suture ultrasound does not use ionizing radiation; it is easy to perform, allows an early diagnosis, and directs toward the execution of the cranial 3D-CT scan, neurosurgical consultation, and possible intervention. The aim of the study is to describe the high sensitivity and specificity of suture ultrasound for the differential diagnosis between plagiocephaly and craniosynostosis. METHODS: We reported our prospective experience and compared it with the data in the literature through a systematic review. The systematic review was conducted on electronic medical databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science) evaluating the published literature up to November 2020. According to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-ANALYSES (PRISMA statement), we identified 2 eligible studies. Additionally, according to AMSTAR 2, all included reviews have been critically rated as high quality. A total of 120 infants with abnormal skull shape were examined in NICU. All underwent clinical and ultrasound examination. RESULTS: Of the total, 105 (87.5%) had plagiocephaly and 15 dolichocephaly/scaphocephaly (12.5%). None of these had associated other types of malformations and/or neurological disorders. The synostotic suture was identified ultrasonographically in 1 infant and subsequently confirmed by 3D CT scan (100%). CONCLUSION: Cranial sutures ultrasonography can be considered in infants a selective, excellent screening method for the evaluation of skull shape deformities as first technique before the 3D CT scan exam and subsequent neurosurgical evaluation. Cranial suture ultrasonography should be considered part of clinical practice especially for pediatricians.",0

2111,"INTRODUCTION: Neurovascular ultrasound is a non-invasive, portable and fast imaging method that, when performed by an experienced neurosonologist, offers reliable and reproducible information on the morphological and hemodynamic status of cervical and intracranial vessels. AIM: To review the available evidence regarding the use of this tool in the approach to acute stroke. DEVELOPMENT: Neurovascular ultrasound can be used in one of two ways: diagnostic and therapeutic. Considering the low recanalization rates of internal carotid artery and proximal medial cerebral artery occlusions with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA), neurovascular ultrasound used shortly in Emergency Department may help to select patients that could benefit from endovascular therapy. Moreover, ultrasound monitorization during intravenous r-tPA treatment allows the analysis of the pattern of arterial recanalization. Cervical ultrasound allows the assessment of the stenosis degree and the composition/surface of an arterial plaque that could, for instance, reveal earlier a candidate for carotid intervention. Finally, the therapeutic potential of ultrasound is also being investigated. Sonothrombolysis and sonolysis, that combine ultrasound technology with r-tPA and use exclusively the ultrasound to lyse the clot, respectively, showed promising results. CONCLUSION: Neurovascular ultrasound has greatly expanded to assume an important role in the study of cerebrovascular disorders.",0
2112,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review focuses on developments in muscle ultrasound as a noninvasive and accurate tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of neuromuscular disease. It discusses current muscle ultrasound applications with already proven clinical value, and highlights recent technical developments that may further advance muscle ultrasounds' diagnostic qualities. RECENT FINDINGS: The sensitivity and specificity of muscle ultrasound for detecting a neuromuscular disorder are high (90-95%), and quantitative ultrasound is well suited to monitor disease progression in several disorders. Adding ultrasound to electromyography significantly improves diagnostic certainty in patients with suspected motor neuron disease, and ultrasound increases the detection of fasciculations with 30-50%. New developments include speckle tracking of tissue motion to quantify diaphragm excursions and diminished muscle contractility in dystrophy, and strain elastography to detect changes in muscle stiffness and anisotropy during contraction and in disease states. Deep learning algorithms are being developed to predict the presence of a muscle disease and differentiate between disorders. SUMMARY: Muscle ultrasound is excellent for screening, diagnosing, and follow-up of neuromuscular disease. New developments are underway to automate and objectify the diagnostic process, and to quantify tissue motion that can provide new insights in pathophysiology and serve as a biomarker.",0
2114,"BACKGROUND: Increasing interest in identifying cerebral hemodynamics alterations as a cause of possible onset or worsening of cognitive impairment in elderly patients with vascular risk factors. INTRODUCTION: Intracranial ultrasound is a non-invasive, repeatable inexpensive method for recording variation of the cerebral vascular tree in physiological and pathological conditions and the diagnosis of vascular dementia (VaD). METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library and reference lists have been searched for articles published until March 30, 2020. RESULTS: Clinical studies reported different Transcranial Doppler (TCD) parameters and subsequently transcranial duplex with color code (TCCD) in patients affected by vascular dementia. The number of studies using TCCD remains limited and most of the available data are still based on TCD. However, the use of transcranial Doppler could better stratify elderly patients with initial signs of cognitive impairment.

2115,"PURPOSE: To review the literature regarding the use of penile ultrasound in the evaluation and management of Peyronie's disease. METHODS: A literature review was performed using PubMed from 1980 to 2018 using the keywords: Peyronie's disease, ultrasound, sonography, calcification, penile fracture, and penile hematoma. Articles were reviewed for study size, image protocols, and findings. In addition, we reviewed images from 227 penile ultrasounds performed on Peyronie's disease patients at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center between 2014 and 2018. RESULTS: Through extensive urological and radiographic literature review over the last four decades, common patterns and characteristic of Peyronie's plaques were identified. These characteristics are not always delineated by physical examination alone. The ultrasound images often added objective information including etiology of erectile dysfunction and location or plaques, and presence of calcifications which aid in patient counseling and treatment protocols. CONCLUSIONS: The use of B-mode ultrasound with color Doppler in the evaluation and management of Peyronie's disease is a quick, cost-effective process that provides objective information that can assist the urologist in the treatment of patients with Peyronie's disease.",0
2117,Angular pregnancy is a rare entity which is commonly confused with interstitial or cornual pregnancies. A lack of consensus about the specific ultrasound features of these 3 entities leads to inappropriate interchange between them among the literature. An angular pregnancy should be considered as a potentially viable intra-uterine eccentric pregnancy as it might be carried to term and result in a live-born baby whereas interstitial or cornual pregnancies should be considered as ectopic pregnancies which should be interrupted. We report here two cases of women at 8 weeks of pregnancy with an angular pregnancy diagnosed by vaginal 2D and 3D ultrasound and discuss about specific ultrasound features and alternative imaging modalities to distinguish it from interstitial and cornual pregnancies.,0
2118,"Aim: Groove pancreatitis (GP) is a rare type of chronic pancreatitis characterized by varying degrees of thickening and scarring of the duodenal wall, duodenal lumen stenosis, mucosal hypertrophy with plicae and cyst formation. GP is primarily observed in middle-aged male patients with a history of alcohol consumption. Clinical symptoms are usually non-specific, and there is currently no unified diagnostic standard. However, imaging methods, particularly endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), are useful for diagnosis. EUS-guided biopsy can provide a strong basis for the final diagnosis. This review summarizes the value of EUS and its derivative technologies in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment of GP.Methods: After searching in PubMed and Web of Science databases using 'groove pancreatitis (GP)' and 'endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)' as keywords, studies related were compiled and examined.Results: EUS and its derivative technologies are of great significance in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of GP, but there are still limitations that need to be comprehensively applied with other diagnostic methods to obtain the most accurate results.Conclusion: EUS has unique value in both the diagnosis and treatment of GP. Clinicians need to be well-versed in the advantages and limitations of EUS for GP diagnosis to select the most suitable imaging diagnostic method for different cases and to reduce the unnecessary waste of medical resources.",0
2119,"BACKGROUND: Endometrial lesions include endometrial cancer and inferior fibroids. Among them, endometrial cancer as a malignant tumor seriously endangers the life and health of patients. Ultrasonography is an important means of diagnosing female reproductive system diseases, and it is of critical value for the early diagnosis of endometrial cancer. However, different ultrasound inspection programs have achieved different results. It is of great significance to choose a suitable inspection program. AIM: To explore the diagnostic efficacy of different ultrasonic examination methods in clinical endometrial lesions. METHODS: The 140 patients with endometrial lesions who were treated in our hospital from April 2018 to October 2019 were used as the research subjects. All patients underwent transvaginal color ultrasound and transabdominal color ultrasound. We compared the diagnostic coincidence and image display effects of the two different examination methods, and the endometrial thickness, blood flow, uterine effusion and resistance index of different diseases were observed by transvaginal color ultrasound. RESULTS: The diagnostic coincidence rate of all types of diseases of transvaginal color ultrasound was significantly higher than that of transabdominal color ultrasound (P = 0.001, 0.005, 0.001 and 0.001). In addition, the excellent and good rate of image display of transvaginal color ultrasound was higher than that of transabdominal color ultrasound (P = 0.001). There were significant differences in endometrial thickness in patients with different types of endometrial lesions through the transvaginal color examination (P = 0.001). The incidence rate of uterine effusion in patients with endometrial carcinoma was significantly higher than that in patients with other types of endometrial lesions (P = 0.001), and the rate of the blood flow was the highest (P = 0.001). The comparison of blood flow resistance index indicated that the blood flow resistance index in endometrial cancer patients was the lowest, which shows that the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The overall diagnostic efficacy of transvaginal color ultrasound in the clinical diagnosis of endometrial lesions is better than that of transabdominal color ultrasound, which held higher diagnostic coincidence rate and image display effect. There were significant differences in the thickness of the endometrium and the blood flow in different types of lesions.",0

2123,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the differences of ultrasound findings between subhepatic appendicitis and appendicitis at a normal position, then discuss the diagnostic strategies and improve the accuracy of diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in our hospital. One thousand five hundred ninety-one patients with appendicitis were diagnosed from January 2014 to January 2018. Eighteen patients with subhepatic appendicitis and 25 patients with appendicitis with regular positions were selected randomly as the control group. The difference in ultrasound features between the two groups was studied. Comparisons between the two groups showed statistically significant differences in the frequencies of the fishbone sign, enlarged appendix, appendicoliths, and hyperechoic omental cap (P<0.05). RESULTS: Statistical significance was not observed with the difference in the frequency of whether there was lymphadenectasis (P>0.05) in the abdominal cavity between the two groups. The Pareto chart was drawn to look for the main factors associated. The results of interpretation on the critical points of diagnosis for subhepatic appendicitis: (I) the fishbone sign of a dilated ileum in the right lower abdomen; and (II) the fishbone sign of a dilated ileum in the right lower abdomen + presence of an enlarged appendix in the right upper abdomen. CONCLUSIONS: An abnormally dilated ileum in the right lower abdomen - the fishbone sign, is a vital sign leading to the diagnosis of subhepatic appendicitis. The fishbone sign of a dilated ileum in the right lower abdomen + whether there is a vermiform structure is an important diagnostic indicator for subhepatic appendicitis.",0
2124,"The present study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of clinical tests and ultrasonography in detecting ankle ligament injuries. In this cross-sectional study, 105 patients with a history of ankle sprain were included. Ankle ligaments, including syndesmosis of ankle, as well as deltoid, calcaneofibular, anterior talofibular, and posterior talofibular ligaments were evaluated by clinical tests, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound and clinical tests were assessed in normal, sprain, partial tear, and complete tear groups. The inter-observer reliability (Cohen's Kappa score) of the evaluated techniques with magnetic resonance imaging was assessed. Anterior drawer test showed a sensitivity and specificity of 81 and 80% in the detection of anterior talofibular ligament injuries, respectively. Ultrasonography showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing normal anterior talofibular ligament from the torn or sprained ligament with a kappa value of 1. The sensitivity of ultrasonography in detecting normal calcaneofibular ligament and deltoid ligament was 93% and 90%, respectively. Ultrasonography was highly specific in detecting calcaneofibular ligament tear but it was not sensitive in this regard. Ultrasonography was proved reliable in determining the normal anterior talofibular ligament and calcaneofibular ligament from the torn or sprained ligament. Ultrasonography is an effective complementary tool for primary evaluation of ankle injuries, which leads to early diagnosis and efficient quality of care. Clinical tests are not reliable to rule out the ankle ligaments injury and the results should be interpreted with caution.",0
2125,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy of ultrasound, sialography, and sialendoscopy for examining benign salivary gland obstructions. METHODS: In this prospective study, patients with symptoms of obstruction of the major salivary gland duct system presenting at the ENT Clinic University Hospital, Ostrava, from June 2010 to December 2013 were included. All patients (n=76) underwent ultrasound, sialography, and sialoendoscopy. The signs of sialolithiasis, ductal stenosis, or normal findings were recorded after the examinations. Statistical analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of all the methods was performed, as well as a comparison of the accuracy of each method for different kinds of pathology (sialolithiasis or stenosis). RESULTS: The sensitivity of ultrasound, sialography, and sialoendoscopy for sialolithiasis findings were 71.9%, 86.7 %, and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of sialography and sialoendoscopy for stenosis of the duct was 69.0%, and 100%, respectively. The study showed impossibility of ultrasonic diagnostics of ductal stenosis. The sensitivity of sialoendoscopy for both pathologies was significantly higher than that from ultrasound or sialography (p<0.05). The specificity of sialoendoscopy was significantly higher than that from by ultrasound or sialography (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Sialoendoscopy was the most accurate method for examination ductal pathology, with significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than by ultrasound or sialography.",0
2127,"Diagnostic ultrasound is a valuable imaging tool that is slowly gaining in popularity among sports medicine clinicians. Commonly referred to as ""musculoskeletal ultrasound,"" its valuable role in assisting with sports medicine diagnoses has been to date underused for a variety of reasons. Effective clinical usage for sports medicine diagnoses includes commonly seen conditions such as rotator cuff disease, ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow injury, and internal derangement of the knee, among many others. Limitation of clinical usage has been deterred by the cost of the unit, perception of time associated with assessment procedures, and the lack of formal training associated with diagnostic implementation. However, when properly used, musculoskeletal ultrasound can increase the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment, improve time to treatment intervention, and improve patient satisfaction. The purpose of this paper is to review the fundamentals of musculoskeletal ultrasound and present its specific diagnostic uses.",0
2128,"Clinical questions often arise suddenly and at odd hours during the intrapartum period. Many questions can be answered immediately by making use of readily available diagnostic ultrasonography. The verification of fetal life, fetal number and fetal presentation, amniotic fluid assessment and determination of placental location are important in maternal-fetal care. Sonographic skills facilitate the performance of certain procedures, including external version of the breech fetus, intrapartum twin management and amniocentesis for lung-maturity testing or culture in cases of suspected chorioamnionitis. Sonography can be helpful in the evaluation of possible placental abruption, but management of this condition remains clinical and should not be affected by a negative sonographic scan.",0
2130,"Clinical assessment and workup of patients referred to cardiologists may need an extension to chest disease. This requires more in-depth examination of respiratory co-morbidities due to uncertainty or severity of the clinical presentation. The filter and integration of ecg and echocardiographic information, addressing to the clues of right ventricular impairment, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary hypertension, and other less frequent conditions, such as congenital, inherited and systemic disease, usually allow more timely diagnosis and therapeutic choice. The concurrent use of thoracic ultrasound (TUS) is important, because, despite the evidence of the strict links between cardiac and respiratory medicine, heart and chest US imaging approaches are still separated. Actually, available expertise, knowledge, skills and training and equipment's suitability are not equally fitting for heart or lung examination and not always already accessible in the same room or facility. Echocardiography is useful for study and monitoring of several respiratory conditions and even detection, so that this is nowadays an established functional complementary tool in pulmonary fibrosis and diffuse interstitial disease diagnosis and monitoring. Extending the approach of the cardiologist to lung and pleura will allow the achievement of information on pleural effusion, even minimal, lung consolidation and pneumothorax. Electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and US equipment are the friendly extension of the physical examination, if their use relies on adequate knowledge and training and on appropriate setting of efficient and working machines. Lacking these premises, overshadowing or misleading artefacts may impair the usefulness of TUS as an imaging procedure.",0
2131,"Medical implants are routinely tracked and monitored using different techniques, such as MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound. Due to the need for ionizing radiation, the two former methods pose a significant risk to tissue. Ultrasound imaging, however, is non-invasive and presents no known risk to human tissue. Aerogels are an emerging material with great potential in biomedical implants. While qualitative observation of ultrasound images by experts can already provide a lot of information about the implants and the surrounding structures, this paper describes the development and study of two simple B-Mode image analysis techniques based on attenuation measurements and echogenicity comparisons, which can further enhance the study of the biological tissues and implants, especially of different types of biocompatible aerogels.",0
2132,"The article reviews the major challenges related to the principles of the correct technique of musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK US). All the crucial aspects of correct MSK soft tissue diagnosis have been discussed, including equipment settings, use of recent image software innovations and ultrasound standoff pads, and correct transducer positioning. The importance of the fundamental principles of MSK US, facilitating good quality image and limiting the occurrence of artifacts, has been highlighted. The most common artifacts of the musculoskeletal system have been described, including those that diagnostically helpful, such as the presence of echo enhancement deep to a fluid-filled structure, or an acoustic shadow behind a calcification. The presence of acoustic shadow in the context of lesions of a different type has also been discussed. The common anisotropy-related artifacts, frequently leading to diagnosis of a pathological condition where none is present, have been elaborated on. The frequently encountered mirror reflection artifact has been described. Special attention has been paid to the means of either eliminating, or taking advantage of artifacts for the correct diagnosis of musculoskeletal lesions. The possibilities and technique of correct differentiation of hypoechoic or anechoic foci, commonly found in the pathological conditions of the musculoskeletal system, have been analysed. Non-typical ultrasound findings leading to misdiagnosis of given pathological conditions have been discussed.",0
2134,"For a long time the lung has been regarded as inaccessible to ultrasound. However, recent clinical studies have shown that this organ can be examined by this technique, which appears, in some situations, to be superior to thoracic radiography. The examination does not require special equipment and is possible using a combination of simple qualitative signs: lung sliding, the presence of B lines and the demonstration of the lung point. The lung sliding corresponds to the artefact produced by the movement of the two pleural layers, one against the other. The B lines indicate the presence of an interstitial syndrome. The presence of lung sliding and/or B lines has a negative predictive value of 100% and formally excludes a pneumothorax in the area where the probe has been applied. The presence of the lung point is pathognomonic of pneumothorax but the sensitivity is no more than 60%. Ultrasound is therefore a rapid and simple means of excluding a pneumothorax (lung sliding or B lines) and of confirming a pneumothorax when the lung point is visible. The question that remains is whether ultrasound can totally replace radiography in the management of this disorder.",0
2135,"The safety of exposure to diagnostic ultrasound is evaluated using a structured approach to risk assessment, based on the acoustic output of present ultrasound scanners. Thermal hazard is described, the magnitude and probability of temperature rise is reviewed, and the severity of harm from any outcome is reviewed. Similar assessments are made separately for acoustic cavitation and gas-body effects, which have previously been considered together. Finally, radiation pressure is considered in a similar manner. In each case, means to minimize the risk are suggested where appropriate. The highest risks are associated with the use of gas-bubble contrast agents. It is concluded that there is a medium risk associated with trans-cranial Doppler use, and that this use of ultrasound deserves more detailed safety review. The risks associated with the current practice of obstetric ultrasound are low. Whilst the severity of radiation pressure as a hazard is low, it is always present. Little is known about any associated cell responses and so the associated risk cannot be evaluated.",0
2136,"A growing number of repaired and refurbished diagnostic ultrasound probes are supplied by a small number of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and many third-party vendors. OEMs ensure that their devices meet regulatory requirements; any repairs using non-OEM materials carry the risk of non-compliance. The aim of this study was to test examples of probe repairs using methods selected to illustrate their possible impact on function. Of 3212 used probes assessed, 21 were found to have undergone repair involving functional parts: 9 incorrectly wired, 11 non-OEM arrays and 1 relensed probe. For repairs not involving functional parts, before and after electronic probe testing may be sufficient to determine that no damage has occurred. For repairs involving functional parts, a more comprehensive suite of tests is necessary to determine that the materials, parts and final product match the performance of the OEM probe and meet regulatory requirements.",0
2137,"PURPOSE: As an adjunct to mammography, ultrasound can improve the detection of breast cancer in women with dense breasts. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of automated breast ultrasound system (ABUS) and handheld ultrasound (HHUS) in Chinese women with dense breasts, both in combination with mammography and separately. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional multicenter clinical research study. Nine hundred and thirty-seven women with dense breasts underwent ABUS, HHUS, and mammography at one of five tertiary-care hospitals. The diagnostic performance of ABUS and HHUS was evaluated in combination with mammography, or separately in women with mammography-negative dense breasts. The agreement between ABUS and HHUS in breast cancer detection was also assessed. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combination of ABUS or HHUS with mammography was 99.1% (219/221), and the specificities were 86.9% (622/716) and 84.9% (608/716), respectively. The area under the curve was 0.93 for ABUS combined with mammography and 0.92 for that of HHUS combined with mammography. Statistically significant agreement between ABUS and HHUS in breast cancer detection was observed (percent agreement = 0.94, κ = 0.85). The incremental cancer detection rate in mammography-negative dense breasts was 42.8 per 1000 ultrasound examinations. CONCLUSIONS: Both ABUS and HHUS as adjuncts to mammography can significantly improve the breast cancer detection rate in women with dense breasts, and there is a strong correlation between them. Given the high prevalence of dense breasts and the multiple advantages of ABUS over HHUS, such as less operator dependence and reproducibility, ABUS showed great potential for use in breast cancer early detection, especially in resource-limited areas.",0
2138,"OBJECTIVE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical disease commonly found in many clinical cases, with a mortality rate of approximately 50%. Early diagnosis and intervention are important for improving ARDS prognosis. In this study, the applications of lung ultrasound in ARDS diagnosis and assessment are reviewed to clarify its key clinical values and application prospects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to the standard diagnosis of ARDS based on the Berlin definition, CXR or CT examination should be conducted. However, both the blurred images of the former, as well as the inconvenience and high risks of the latter, impose restrictions on their application in critically ill patients. RESULTS: Lung ultrasound was shown to improve safety, effectiveness, lacked radiation, can be performed bedside, and offers dynamic functionality. CONCLUSIONS: It may be a suitable approach to replace or complement traditional imaging examinations with lung ultrasound.",0
2139,"The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) relies essentially on a probabilistic approach that requires careful clinical assessments, targeted laboratory tests, and the use of appropriate imaging tools. Nowadays, the diagnostic gold standard is computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. Lung ultrasound (LUS) can play a role in the diagnosis of PE mainly by allowing the visualization of peripheral lung infarctions. Hypoechoic, pleural-based parenchymal consolidation is the most typical and common finding of pulmonary infarction. More than 85% of infarct lesions are wedge-shaped, extending to the pleural surface and are localized to where the patient complains of pleuritic chest pain. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be performed in addition to basic ultrasound examination to ascertain nonvascularization of the consolidation, thus confirming that the lesion is an infarct. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the latest evidence on the application of LUS to the diagnosis of PE, focusing purely on thoracic/lung signs.",0
2141,"Conventional medical imaging technologies, including ultrasound, have continued to improve over the years. For example, in oncology, medical imaging is characterized by high sensitivity, i.e., the ability to detect anomalous tissue features, but the ability to classify these tissue features from images often lacks specificity. As a result, a large number of biopsies of tissues with suspicious image findings are performed each year with a vast majority of these biopsies resulting in a negative finding. To improve specificity of cancer imaging, quantitative imaging techniques can play an important role. Conventional ultrasound B-mode imaging is mainly qualitative in nature. However, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) imaging can provide specific numbers related to tissue features that can increase the specificity of image findings leading to improvements in diagnostic ultrasound. QUS imaging can encompass a wide variety of techniques including spectral-based parameterization, elastography, shear wave imaging, flow estimation, and envelope statistics. Currently, spectral-based parameterization and envelope statistics are not available on most conventional clinical ultrasound machines. However, in recent years, QUS techniques involving spectral-based parameterization and envelope statistics have demonstrated success in many applications, providing additional diagnostic capabilities. Spectral-based techniques include the estimation of the backscatter coefficient (BSC), estimation of attenuation, and estimation of scatterer properties such as the correlation length associated with an effective scatterer diameter (ESD) and the effective acoustic concentration (EAC) of scatterers. Envelope statistics include the estimation of the number density of scatterers and quantification of coherent to incoherent signals produced from the tissue. Challenges for clinical application include correctly accounting for attenuation effects and transmission losses and implementation of QUS on clinical devices. Successful clinical and preclinical applications demonstrating the ability of QUS to improve medical diagnostics include characterization of the myocardium during the cardiac cycle, cancer detection, classification of solid tumors and lymph nodes, detection and quantification of fatty liver disease, and monitoring and assessment of therapy.",0
2143,"Hepatic steatosis is a commonly seen phenomenon in clinical practice and is the result of the accumulation of lipids in the hepatocytes. In most cases steatosis refers to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but it also occurs in other diseases of the liver parenchyma of a different etiology and is the result of the dysregulation of metabolic processes. Consequently, inflammatory processes can induce progressive fibrosis. Due to the high prevalence of fatty liver disease, a further increase in metabolic liver cirrhosis with corresponding complications can be expected in the near future. Due to its broad availability, ultrasound is particularly important, especially for the management of NAFLD. In addition to diagnosis and risk stratification, the monitoring of high-risk patients in NAFLD is becoming increasingly clinically important. Multimodality ultrasound includes B-mode and duplex methods, analysis of tissue stiffness (elastography), contrast-enhanced imaging (CEUS), and steatosis quantification. When using ultrasound in fatty liver disease, a standardized approach that takes into account the limitations of the method is essential.",0
2144,"BACKGROUND: Ultrasound (US) diagnostic techniques have the advantages of low cost, convenient operation, and high availability. PURPOSE: To explore the diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric US in evaluating signs of peripheral schwannoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective case-control study included patients with soft-tissue masses on the limbs (divided into the schwannoma and non-schwannoma groups) between January 2017 and November 2020. US features were compared between the two groups, and receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of these features. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients were included in this study; of them, 63 (38.2%) were diagnosed with schwannoma. Regular morphology (95.2% vs. 39.2%), cystic degeneration (71.4% vs. 27.5%), target sign on elastography (82.5% vs. 0), and polar blood supply sign (87.3% vs. 14.7%) were more common in schwannomas than in non-schwannoma lesions (all P < 0.001). Combining the four signs for diagnosis of schwannomas, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 95.24%, 96.08%, and 95.76%, respectively, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.987 (95% confidence interval = 0.955-0.998). Entering and exiting nerve sign was observed in 87.3% of schwannomas and in 3.0% of non-schwannoma lesions (P < 0.001), while split-fat sign was similar between the two groups (9.5% vs. 2.0%; P = 0.068). CONCLUSION: Polar blood supply sign and target sign on elastography are specific US signs in peripheral schwannomas. The combination of two-dimensional imaging, color flow imaging, and elastography can achieve an excellent diagnostic accuracy in schwannomas.",0
2145,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) comprises several techniques of performing high-frequency ultrasound via an endoscope placed in the gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus, stomach, duodenum and pancreaticobiliary tree and rectum). It has rapidly become an important tool in the investigation of a variety of lumenal disorders as well as locoregional staging of gastrointestinal malignancies. Needle biopsy of peri-intestinal structures, such as lymph nodes and pancreatic masses, can also be performed under real-time ultrasound control. To date, the utilization of this technology in Australia has been limited by cost constraints and a paucity of training opportunities. EUS continues to be a rapidly growing area in clinical gastroenterology. Recent studies continue to define its role, particularly in the loco-regional staging of a variety of malignancies. In addition, new instruments permit tissue sampling and a variety of therapeutic manoeuvres under direct ultrasound guidance.33; 26-32)",0
2146,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess the diagnostic yield of ultrasonography in the identification of the etiology of hydramnios, and the added value of MRI or amniocentesis. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study including pregnancies with confirmed hydramnios (defined as deepest pocket ≥8 cm) between January 2013 and May 2017. Twin pregnancies, secondary hydramnios discovered after the diagnosis of a causal pathology, and pregnancies of unknown outcome were excluded. All pregnancies underwent a targeted scan, and selected cases underwent MRI or amniocentesis. RESULTS: A total of 158 patients with confirmed hydramnios were included. Hydramnios was associated with a fetal pathology in 37 cases (23.4%), with diabetes in 39 (24.6%), isolated macrosomia in 16 (10.1%), and considered idiopathic in 66 (41.7%). Ultrasonography established a diagnosis of the underlying pathology in 73% of cases. Amniocentesis was done in 31 cases (20%) and it allowed diagnosis of chromosome anomalies, esophageal atresia, myotonic dystrophy congenital type, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Bartter syndrome. MRI was done in 15 cases (10%) and it allowed one additional diagnosis of esophageal atresia. The diagnostic yields of MRI and amniocentesis were 91.7% and 95.2%, respectively. There were five false positive diagnoses at ultrasonography, and one false positive diagnosis at MRI. CONCLUSION: Hydramnios can be associated with a wide variety of underlying pathologies. Diagnostic ultrasound can attain a diagnosis in the majority of cases. Amniocentesis offers a valuable complementary assessment.",0
2147,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of our article is to give an overview of the current and future possibilities of real-time image fusion involving ultrasound. We present a review of the existing English-language peer-reviewed literature assessing this technique, which covers technical solutions (for ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound), image fusion in several anatomic regions, and electromagnetic needle tracking.

2149,"Pulmonary capillary hemorrhage (PCH) has been found in mammalian lungs exposed to diagnostic ultrasound (DUS), although the mechanism is poorly understood. This work investigates acoustic atomization and fountains at liquid-air interfaces subjected to DUS, which has been suggested as a possible PCH damage mechanism. Primarily using a SuperSonic Imagine Aixplorer DUS machine (SuperSonic Imagine, Aix-en-Provence, France), blood and water surfaces were excited in vitro by DUS and recorded with a high-speed camera. The surface was driven by B-mode, color Doppler, pulsed Doppler, and shear wave elastography imaging modes with center frequencies from 5.0-7.2 MHz and mechanical indexes (MI) up to 1.7. Fountains and atomization were only observed for SWE, for MI as low as 1.0. A comparison of the SWE waveforms with the surface dynamics suggests that fountains and atomization were driven by push-pulses and depended on pulse duration and intensity. However, we conclude that atomization and fountaining are unlikely primary mechanisms behind all DUS-induced PCH because neither phenomenon occurred for traditional diagnostic imaging modes.",0
2150,"BACKGROUND: The difficulty in determining synovitis, tenosynovitis, or enthesitis by physical examination (PE) has limited the diagnostic capability of CASPAR for psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of CASPAR with the integration of ultrasound (US). METHODS: Patients with a hint of PsA were enrolled. Besides routine PE for tender or swollen joints, enthesitis, and dactylitis, US was performed to evaluate peripheral joints, entheses, and tendons. The additional value of the US to the CASPAR criteria was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 326 consecutive patients with 164 PsA and 162 non-PsA were enrolled. A total of 162 non-PsA patients consisted of 58 cases of psoriasis (PsO), 27 osteoarthritis with PsO/family history of PsO, five fibromyalgia with PsO, 69 sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis, and three undifferentiated arthritis. Significantly higher frequencies of tenosynovitis and enthesitis on US and new bone formation on X-rays were found in PsA vs. non-PsA patients (59.1% vs. 13.0%; 63.4% vs. 14.2%; 62.2% vs. 8.0%, p <0.01 for all). Logistic regression analysis showed that dactylitis (OR = 12.0, p <0.01), family history of PsO/PsA (OR = 3.1, p <0.05), nail involvement (OR = 3.5, p = 0.01), new bone formation on X-ray (OR = 14.8, p <0.01), tenosynovitis on US (OR = 21.3, p <0.01), and enthesitis on US (OR = 21.7, p <0.01) were independent risk factors for PsA. By combining US tenosynovitis and/or enthesitis, the diagnostic utility of CASPAR criteria was improved, with superior specificity (91.4% vs. 84.0%) and similar sensitivity (95.7% vs. 94.5%). Replacing X-ray by US or adding US, the CASPAR criteria showed comparable sensitivity and specificity for PsA diagnosis. The diagnostic accuracy was 89.3% for CASPAR criteria based on PE, 93.6% for CASPAR added with US, and 93.3% for CASPAR with US replacing X-ray. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic utility of the CASPAR was improved by integrating tenosynovitis and/or enthesitis when using US. US provides additional value for PsA recognition.",0
2151,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficiency and the place of grey scale ultrasound and color Doppler sonography of the larynx in the diagnosis of laryngeal pathology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective blind cohort examination in B-mode laryngeal ultrasound (LUS) and color Doppler imaging (CDI) with linear scanning transducer 7-15 MHz was performed in 120 patients aged from 6 months to 52 years (average age 7.6±5.8 years, Me 6 year) and in 40 patients without laryngeal pathology (average age 7.0±5.0 years). The patients presented with complaints of voice and/or stridor. The diagnosis was verified by followed laryngoscopy. RESULTS: Laryngeal papillomas, hemangiomas, scarring and vocal fold's nodules were identified as hyperechoic formations. Color Doppler sonography made it possible to visualize them better: small formations were highlighted in color and the space around the large ones was colored. There were paradoxical movements of the hyperechoic arytenoid cartilages during inspiration to the anterior commissure in patients with laryngomalacia. Color Doppler ultrasonography revealed changes during phonation in patients with functional dysphonia. The sensitivity and specificity of LUS were 58% (95% CI 48-66) and 98% (95% CI 87-99) compared with laryngoscopy in the detection of laryngeal pathology, but laryngeal CDI - 81% (95% CI 72-87) and 98% (95% CI 87-99) respectively. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound of the larynx in B-mode has a diagnostic efficiency of 67.5%, and in CDI mode - 85% for ruling in laryngeal pathologies compared to laryngoscopy. So, this method is a modern affordable, non-invasive and informative diagnostic tool for the detection of laryngeal diseases, especially in those cases, when it is impossible to carry out a laryngoscopy.",0
2152,"With increase in population, modes of transportation and a fast pace of life, an individual's chances of accident and thereby chances of getting fractured have increased significantly. Fracture has thus become a significant factor contributing to morbidity and mortality. To resume a normal life, after one suffers from a fracture is also an ordeal. The transition appears smooth if the fracture healing goes on in a smooth manner as is expected through its routine stages of reactive phase, reparative phase and remodeling phase. But if in this chain something goes wrong or some factors are not optimum upto the mark, then the process becomes unsuccessful and the repair is either partial or directionless. It is therefore very vital to confirm whether or not the callus which bridges the fractured fragments is healthy or not. Here in lies the role of imaging as it can show the status of callus without disturbing it. What complicates the picture is that a callus might not be well demonstratable unless it mineralizes or calcifies. An imaging modality like ultrasound therefore stands out as it can show the state of callus in its different stages. This article aims at demonstrating how ultrasound- a non invasive diagnostic imaging modality can give precise information about the progress of fracture healing and thereby aid in management of fractures, so that an individual can return back to normal productive lifestyle. This preliminary study highlights the spectrum of fracture healing as seen on ultrasound.",0
2153,"The soleal sling may be a site of tibial nerve entrapment. Objective diagnosis of this syndrome is difficult with current nerve conduction study techniques, magnetic resonance imaging, and neurosensory testing. Diagnostic ultrasound is ideally suited to visualize the tibial nerve statically and dynamically as it enters the soleal sling, thus making an objective diagnosis of soleal sling impingement much easier.",0
2157,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is an emerging technique that can be used to visualize lesions in or adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract. We performed a review of current indications and capabilities of endoscopic ultrasound. EUS provides diagnostic information on submucosal lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. It is the most accurate method for local staging of esophageal and rectal cancer. It appears to be more sensitive in detecting common bile duct stones than endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Furthermore, its use avoids the risk of pancreatitis. Lesions deep to the gastrointestinal tract, such as mediastinal nodes or pancreatic lesions, can be biopsied through the EUS endoscope. New therapeutic uses of EUS include aid in endoscopic drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts and celiac axis neurolysis for the treatment of pain from pancreatic cancer. EUS offers many new diagnostic capabilities to visualize and biopsy lesions in or adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract. Therapeutic uses are also emerging for this new technique.",0
2158,"Ultrasound has become essential in the diagnosis and management of the infertile male. Scrotal ultrasonography provides a detailed examination of the testes and assesses the presence or absence of varicoceles and can identify other abnormalities of the scrotal contents and the spermatic cord. Transrectal ultrasonography can ""visualize"" the excurrent ejaculatory ductal system, including the ejaculatory ducts, seminal vesicles, and vas deferens. The expansion of these ultrasonographic techniques has provided the urologist with non- or minimally invasive techniques with which to evaluate the infertile male. These advancements consequently have led to innovative surgical and radiologic treatments.",0
2160,"The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of gray-scale ultrasound (US), elastography and a combination of gray-scale ultrasound and elastography (US-E) in differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules with respect to the level of physician experience. Three hundred fifty-eight patients with 367 thyroid nodules who underwent both gray-scale US and elastography, from November 2011 to January 2012, were included in this study. The diagnostic performance of US performed by experienced and less experienced physicians was compared. Comparisons of the diagnostic performance of US, elastography and US-E were evaluated for each group separately. Of 367 nodules, 121 were malignant and 246 were benign. When we compared the diagnostic performance of the experienced and less experienced physician groups, specificity was statistically higher in the experienced physician group for both US alone (p = 0.001) and US-E (p = 0.048). However, the experienced and less experienced physician groups did not differ significantly on other measures of diagnostic performance, regardless of modality. For the experienced physicians, the specificity and positive predictive value US were 88.0% and 76.8%, respectively; both of them were significantly higher than the corresponding values for US-E. For the less experienced physicians, specificity was significantly higher on elastography (93.8%) than on US (71.4%) (p < 0.001). However, diagnostic performance did not differ significantly between US and US-E for the less experienced physicians. Experienced physicians had superior specificity compared with less experienced physicians. The diagnostic performance of elastography and US-E was inferior compared with that of US alone, irrespective of the level of experience of the physician.",0
2162,"In recent years, various types of diagnostic imaging methods, such as CT, MRI, PET and Ultrasound, have been developed rapidly and become indispensable as clinical diagnostic tools. Among these imaging modalities, CT, MRI and PET all apply electromagnetic waves like radiation rays. In contrast, an ultrasound imaging method uses a completely different mechanical pressure wave: ""sound"". Ultrasound has various features, including inaudible sound at very high frequencies, which allows its use in medical diagnoses. That is, ultrasound techniques can be applied in transmission, reflection and Doppler methods. Moreover, the sharp directivity of an ultrasound beam can also improve image resolution. Another big advantage of diagnostic ultrasound is that it does not harm the human body or cause any pain to patients. Given these various advantages, diagnostic ultrasound has recently been widely used in diagnosing cancer and cardiovascular disease and scanning fetuses (Fig. 1) as well as routine clinical examinations in hospitals. In this paper, I outline my almost 50-year history of diagnostic ultrasound research, particularly that performed at the early stage from 1950-56.",0
2163,"BACKGROUND: Noninvasively predicting kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis is important because it's closely correlated with the development and prognosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Most studies of shear wave elastography (SWE) in CKD were limited to non-linear statistical dependencies and didn't fully consider variables' interactions. Therefore, support vector machine (SVM) of machine learning was used to assess the prediction value of SWE and traditional ultrasound techniques in kidney fibrosis. METHODS: We consecutively recruited 117 CKD patients with kidney biopsy. SWE, B-mode, color Doppler flow imaging ultrasound and hematological exams were performed on the day of kidney biopsy. Kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis was graded by semi-quantification of Masson staining. The diagnostic performances were accessed by ROC analysis. RESULTS: Tubulointerstitial fibrosis area was significantly correlated with eGFR among CKD patients (R = 0.450, P < 0.001). AUC of SWE, combined with B-mode and blood flow ultrasound by SVM, was 0.8303 (sensitivity, 77.19%; specificity, 71.67%) for diagnosing tubulointerstitial fibrosis (>10%), higher than either traditional ultrasound, or SWE (AUC, 0.6735 [sensitivity, 67.74%; specificity, 65.45%]; 0.5391 [sensitivity, 55.56%; specificity, 53.33%] respectively. Delong test, p < 0.05); For diagnosing different grades of tubulointerstitial fibrosis, SWE combined with traditional ultrasound by SVM, had AUCs of 0.6429 for mild tubulointerstitial fibrosis (11%-25%), and 0.9431 for moderate to severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis (>50%), higher than other methods (Delong test, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: SWE with SVM modeling could improve the diagnostic performance of traditional kidney ultrasound in predicting different kidney tubulointerstitial fibrosis grades among CKD patients.",0
2164,"BACKGROUND: Doppler ultrasound can diagnose testicular torsion with high sensitivity and specificity but may delay surgical treatment. This study aims to assess whether the use of doppler ultrasound, in cases with intermediate clinical suspicion of testicular torsion, can improve diagnostic accuracy compared to clinical assessment alone. METHODS: We implemented a new clinical algorithm where patients with intermediate suspicion of testicular torsion undergo doppler ultrasound within 60 min. This study compared the patients that presented within one year prior to the implementation (group 1) to the patients who presented within one year after the implementation (group 2). The primary outcome measure was failure to confirm testicular torsion upon surgical exploration (negative surgical exploration). Missed testicular torsion was one of the secondary endpoints. RESULTS: 590 consecutive patients were included. 322 (55%) in group 1 and 268 (45%) in group 2. There were 9 (2.8%) testicular torsions in group 1 vs 9 (3.4%) in group 2 (p = 0.69) and 2 (0.6%) missed testicular torsions in group 1 vs 0 in group 2 (p = 0.50). Doppler ultrasound was performed in 65 patients (24.2%) in group 2 vs 0 in group 1 (p < 0.01). Negative surgical exploration was performed in 27 (8.4%) patients in group 1 vs 8 (3.0%) in group 2 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Doppler ultrasound assessment of patients at intermediate clinical risk of testicular torsion significantly reduced the frequency of negative surgical explorations without increased rate of missed testicular torsions.",0
2165,"The actual prevalence of superficial endometriosis is not known. However, it is considered the most common subtype of endometriosis. The diagnosis of superficial endometriosis remains difficult. In fact, little is known about the ultrasound features of superficial endometriotic lesions. In this study, we aimed to describe the appearance of superficial endometriosis lesions at ultrasound examination, with laparoscopic and/or histologic correlation. This is a prospective study on a series of 52 women with clinical suspicion of pelvic endometriosis who underwent preoperative transvaginal ultrasound and received a confirmed diagnosis of superficial endometriosis via laparoscopy. Women with ultrasound or laparoscopic findings of deep endometriosis were not included. We observed that superficial endometriotic lesions may appear as a solitary lesions, multiple separate lesions, and cluster lesions. The lesions may exhibit the presence of hypoechogenic associated tissue, hyperechoic foci, and/or velamentous (filmy) adhesions. The lesion may be convex, protruding from the peritoneal surface, or it may appear as a concave defect in the peritoneum. Most lesions exhibited several features. We conclude that transvaginal ultrasound may be useful for diagnosing superficial endometriosis, as these lesions may exhibit different ultrasound features.",0
2166,"Diagnostic ultrasound contrast agents have been developed for enhancing the echogenicity of blood and for delineating other structures of the body. Approved agents are suspensions of gas bodies (stabilized microbubbles), which have been designed for persistence in the circulation and strong echo return for imaging. The interaction of ultrasound pulses with these gas bodies is a form of acoustic cavitation, and they also may act as inertial cavitation nuclei. This interaction produces mechanical perturbation and a potential for bioeffects on nearby cells or tissues. In vitro, sonoporation and cell death occur at mechanical index (MI) values less than the inertial cavitation threshold. In vivo, bioeffects reported for MI values greater than 0.4 include microvascular leakage, petechiae, cardiomyocyte death, inflammatory cell infiltration, and premature ventricular contractions and are accompanied by gas body destruction within the capillary bed. Bioeffects for MIs of 1.9 or less have been reported in skeletal muscle, fat, myocardium, kidney, liver, and intestine. Therapeutic applications that rely on these bioeffects include targeted drug delivery to the interstitium and DNA transfer into cells for gene therapy. Bioeffects of contrast-aided diagnostic ultrasound happen on a microscopic scale, and their importance in the clinical setting remains uncertain.",0
2167,"Objective To assess the value of ultrasound, if indicated, supplemented by sialendoscopy, in the diagnosis of sialolithiasis. Study Design Retrospective study. Setting Referring center for salivary gland diseases. Subjects and Methods All patients who presented with a suspected diagnosis of obstructive sialopathy between January 2011 and April 2017 and had not undergone any treatment were retrospectively evaluated. A total of 2052 patients and 2277 glands were included in the study. Ultrasound examinations were carried out initially and followed by sialendoscopy in all cases. Direct demonstration of sialothiasis by sialendoscopy, transoral ductal surgery, and discharge of concrements/observation of fragments during sialendoscopy after extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy were regarded as definitive evidence of sialolithiasis. Results Ultrasound had an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 94.77%, 94.91%, 94.57%, 96.14%, and 92.89%, respectively, for the diagnosis of sialolithiasis. All false-positive findings were correctly diagnosed, and in all false-negative findings, stones/fragments were visualized by sialendoscopy. Over 95% of the false-negative findings in major salivary glands (64/67) had visible ductal dilation in sonography, and in 73.1%, the stones not detected on ultrasound were located in the distal part of the duct, which is easily accessible with the sialendoscope. Conclusion This study shows that sialolithiasis can be diagnosed using ultrasonography with a high degree of certainty. If supplemented by sialendoscopy, the correct diagnosis could be established in virtually all cases of sialolithiasis. Ultrasound supplemented by sialendoscopy has the potential to serve as an alternative diagnostic standard in the future.",0
2169,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the validity of Doppler ultrasound in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA), using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and biopsy and using as gold standard the patient's definitive clinical diagnosis. METHODS: An observational, descriptive and analytical study of 451 consecutive patients with suspected GCA was conducted, and the clinical history and ultrasound findings of the patients were reviewed. The validity of ACR criteria, temporal arteritis biopsy (TAB) and Doppler ultrasound in the diagnosis of GCA was calculated using the final diagnosis of the doctor in charge as the gold standard. RESULTS: The validity and security of the diagnostic tests used were as follows: ACR criteria had 65.37% sensitivity and 62.89% specificity; positive predictive value [PPV] 70%; negative predictive value [NPV] 57.82%, likelihood ratio [LR] + 1.7619 and LR - 0.5506. Doppler ultrasonography had 91.60% sensitivity and 95.83% specificity; PPV 96.62%; NPV 89.76%, LR + 21.81 and LR - 0.0876; TA biopsy 42.86% sensitivity and 100% specificity; PPV 100%; NPV 35.71% and LR - 0.5714. CONCLUSIONS: The halo sign, especially if bilateral, is a strong predictor of GCA with a level of accuracy sufficient to recommend its introduction into clinical practice and, in our opinion, should be considered in future classification criteria sets.",0
2170,"It is an era of diagnostic and interventional ultrasound (US). Various new techniques such as three-dimensional US (3D US), interventional US, and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) have been introduced into clinical practice. Dr. Xu and his colleagues have taken advantage of these techniques and carried out a series of relevant studies. Their use of 3D US in the liver, gallbladder, liver tumor volumetry, guidance for ablation, and 3D CEUS has widened the application of 3D US in the clinic. They found that prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after thermal ablation with curative intent was determined by treatment response to ablation, pretreatment serum AFP, and liver function reserve. Tumor response to treatment was the most predictive factor for long-term survival. They compared the use of percutaneous microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of HCC and found that both are effective methods in treating HCCs. The local tumor control, complications related to treatment, and long-term survival were equivalent for the two modalities. They first compared the enhancement patterns of HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and proposed the diagnostic clues for ICC, liver angiomyolipoma (AML), gallbladder cancer, renal carcinoma, and renal AML, which have greatly enhanced the role of CEUS in the clinic. They also evaluated the diagnostic performance of CEUS in characterizing complex cystic focal liver lesions and the agreement between two investigators with different experience levels; and found that CEUS is especially useful for the young investigator. They assessed the effect of anti-angiogenic gene therapy for HCC treated by microbubble-enhanced US exposure and concluded that gene therapy mediated by US exposure enhanced by a microbubble contrast agent may become a new treatment option for HCC.",0
2171,"INTRODUCTION: the provision of basic diagnostic imaging services is pivotal to achieving universal health coverage. An estimated two-thirds of the world's population have no access to basic diagnostic imaging. Accurate data on current imaging equipment resources are required to inform health delivery strategy and policy at national level. This is an audit of Zimbabwean public sector diagnostic ultrasound resources and services. METHODS: utilising the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MHCC) database, sequential interviews were conducted with provincial health authorities and local facility managers. Ultrasound equipment, personnel and services in all hospitals and clinics, nationally were recorded, collated, and analysed for the whole country, and by province. RESULTS: of the 1798 Zimbabwean public sector healthcare facilities, sixty-six (n=66, 3.67%) have ultrasound equipment. Ninety-nine (n=99) ultrasound units are distributed across the sonar facilities, representing a national average of 8 units per million people. More than half the equipment units (n=53, 54%) are in secondary-level healthcare facilities (district and mission hospitals), and approximately one-fifth (n=22, 22%) in the central hospitals (quaternary level). The best-resourced province has twice the resources of the least resourced. One-hundred and forty-two (n=142) healthcare workers, from six different professional groups, provide the public sector ultrasound service. Most facilities with sonar equipment (n=64/66, 97%) provide obstetrics and gynaecology services, while general abdominal scanning is available at one third (n=22, 33%). Two facilities with ultrasound equipment have no capacity to offer a sonography service. CONCLUSION: in order to reach the WHO recommendation of 20 sonar units per million people, an estimated 140 additional sonar units are required nationally. The need is greatest in Masvingo, Midlands and Mashonaland East Provinces. Task-shifting plays a key role in the provision of Zimbabwean sonar services. Consideration should be given to formal training and accreditation of all healthcare workers involved in sonar service delivery.",0
2172,"Diagnostic value between ultrasound elastography and ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture biopsy in thyroid nodules was compared to provide reference for the selection of thyroid nodule (TN) diagnostic mode. A total of 194 patients with TN, admitted from June 2014 to June 2015, were selected to be treated with ultrasound elastography and ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture biopsy. The ultrasonic elasticity score and results of ultrasound-guided TN puncture were compared with diagnostic results of surgical or ultrasound follow-up for 12 months, and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of differentiating and diagnosing TN of the two methods were calculated to compare the clinical diagnostic values. A total of 194 patients were diagnosed with TN 217, including 129 benign and 88 malignant lesions. All the nodules were obtained by effective ultrasound elastography and ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture cytological pathological specimens, and it was diagnosed by ultrasound elastography that there were 75 benign nodules and 142 malignant nodules. It was diagnosed by ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture that there were 112 benign, 78 malignant and 27 uncertain nodules. The specificity and accuracy of ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture in the diagnosis of TN were higher than that of ultrasound elastography and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05), while there was no statistically significant difference between the sensitivity of ultrasound elastography and ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture biopsy in the diagnosis of TN (P>0.05). Ultrasound elastography in the diagnosis of TN has a low specificity and the diagnosis of ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture biopsy may have uncertain results. There are some defects in the two diagnostic schemes and their combined application can complement each other's advantages and improve the early diagnostic efficiency of TN.",0
2173,"BACKGROUND: Diaphragmatic myoclonus is a rare disorder of repetitive diaphragmatic contractions, acknowledged to be a spectrum that includes psychogenic features. Electromyography has been the diagnostic tool most commonly used in the literature. METHODS: To test if we could perform a noninvasive technique to delineate the diaphragm as the source of abnormal movements and demonstrate distractibility and entrainability, we used B-mode ultrasound in a patient with diaphragmatic myoclonus. RESULTS: Ultrasound imaging clearly delineated the diaphragm as the source of her abdominal movements. We were able to demonstrate entrainability of the diaphragm to hand tapping to a prescribed rhythm set by examiner. CONCLUSION: We recommend the use of ultrasound as a noninvasive, convenient diagnostic tool for further studies of diaphragmatic myoclonus. We agree with previous findings that diaphragmatic myoclonus may be a functional movement disorder, as evidenced by distractibility and entrainability demonstrated on real-time video with ultrasonography.",0
2175,"OBJECTIVE: Hürthle cell carcinomas (HCCs) of the thyroid have been recently reclassified as a separate entity due to their distinct clinical and molecular profiles. Few studies have assessed the ability of preoperative characteristics in differentiating HCCs from Hürthle cell adenomas (HCAs) due to the low prevalence of both lesions. This study aimed to compare the preoperative features of HCCs and HCAs and evaluate the diagnostic performance of ultrasound in distinguishing between both. SUBJETCS AND METHODS: Retrospective study including 101 patients (52 HCCs and 49 HCAs) who underwent thyroid surgery from 2000 to 2016. Clinical, ultrasonographic, and histological data were reviewed. Diagnostic performance of suspicious sonographic features was analyzed in 51 cases (24 HCCs and 27 HCAs). RESULTS: Hürthle cell neoplasms were predominant in females. Subjects ≥ 55 years represented 58% of the cases of HCCs and 53% of those of HCAs. Carcinomas were significantly larger (p < 0.001), and a tumor size ≥ 4 cm significantly increased the risk of malignancy (odds ratio 3.67). Other clinical, cytologic, and sonographic data were similar between HCCs and HCAs. Among the HCCs, the lesions were purely solid in 54.2%, hypoechoic in 37.5%, and had coarse calcifications in 12.5%, microcalcifications in 8.3%, irregular contours in 4.2%, and a taller-than-wide shape in 16.7%. Predominantly/exclusive intranodular vascularization was observed in 52.6%. Overall, 58% of the HCCs were classified as TI-RADS 4 or 5 compared with 48% of the HCAs. TI-RADS 4 or 5 had a specificity of only 51.8% and a positive likelihood ratio of 1.21. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from the lesion size, no other preoperative feature adequately distinguished HCCs from HCAs. Sonographic characteristics raising suspicion for malignancy, which are mostly present in papillary carcinomas, were infrequent in HCCs. New tools must be developed to improve preoperative diagnosis and deferral of surgery in cases of adenomas.",0
2177,"Recent advances in microelectronic and piezoelectric technology have permitted development of miniaturized ultrasound devices capable of real-time tomographic intravascular imaging. Initial studies have successfully employed intravascular ultrasound to augment angiography in both diagnostic and therapeutic catheterization. The cross-sectional perspective of intravascular ultrasound appears to be ideally suited for precision measurements of luminal diameter and cross-sectional area. In addition, ultrasound improves assessment of problem lesions such as ostial stenoses or disease at bifurcations. Intravascular imaging provides unique, detailed cross-sectional images of the arterial wall not previously obtainable in vivo by any other technique and is more sensitive than angiography in detecting atherosclerosis. Intravascular ultrasound images of atherosclerotic wall abnormalities have the potential to augment greatly the understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of coronary disease. For interventional applications, ultrasound analysis of lesion characteristics offers many potential advantages. Evaluation of the normal reference segment used for device sizing constitutes an important emerging application for intravascular imaging. After the procedure, intravascular ultrasound often yields smaller luminal size measurements than angiography and greater of stenosis. These differences probably reflect augmentation of the apparent angiographic diameter by extraluminal contrast within cracks, fissures or dissection planes. New ultrasound instruments under development combine an imaging transducer with an interventional device, permitting on-line guidance during the procedure. Although the clinical value of routine ultrasound imaging before or after mechanical revascularization has not been tested by randomized trials, it seems likely that this new imaging modality will provide valuable insights into diverse phenomena such as abrupt occlusion and restenosis. Accordingly, we anticipate a continuing role for this modality in cardiovascular interventional therapy.",0
2178,"Ultrasonography (US) is an inexpensive, convenient, and effective tool that can be used to evaluate the shoulder. It does not expose the patient to harmful radiation and can be used to evaluate the musculoskeletal system dynamically. Additionally, US is not subject to metal artifacts when evaluating patients with previously placed hardware. Over the years, US has been found to be reliable and accurate for diagnosing rotator cuff tears (RCTs), despite its operatordependence. The usage of US for diagnosing RCTs in orthopedic practice varies depending on practitioners' familiarity with the exam and the availability of experienced technicians. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnostic accuracy of US for identifying RCTs.",0
2179,"An operationally available diagnostic imaging capability augments spaceflight medical support by facilitating the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of medical or surgical conditions, by improving medical outcomes and, thereby, by lowering medical mission impacts and the probability of crew evacuation due to medical causes. Microgravity-related physiological changes occurring during spaceflight can affect the genitourinary system and potentially cause conditions such as urinary retention or nephrolithiasis for which ultrasonography (U/S) would be a useful diagnostic tool. This study describes the first genitourinary ultrasound examination conducted in space, and evaluates image quality, frame rate, resolution requirements, real-time remote guidance of nonphysician crew medical officers and evaluation of on-orbit tools that can augment image acquisition. A nonphysician crew medical officer (CMO) astronaut, with minimal training in U/S, performed a self-examination of the genitourinary system onboard the International Space Station, using a Philips/ATL Model HDI-5000 ultrasound imaging unit located in the International Space Station Human Research Facility. The CMO was remotely guided by voice commands from experienced, earth-based sonographers stationed in Mission Control Center in Houston. The crewmember, with guidance, was able to acquire all of the target images. Real-time and still U/S images received at Mission Control Center in Houston were of sufficient quality for the images to be diagnostic for multiple potential genitourinary applications. Microgravity-based ultrasound imaging can provide diagnostic quality images of the retroperitoneum and pelvis, offering improved diagnosis and treatment for onboard medical contingencies. Successful completion of complex sonographic examinations can be obtained even with minimally trained nonphysician ultrasound operators, with the assistance of ground-based real-time guidance.",0
2180,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ultrasound has developed significantly over the past decade, becoming a potent imaging modality for the assessment of inflammatory arthritis. Until recently, few published data were available with respect to the use of ultrasound imaging in patients with spondyloarthropathy. This review examines the current state of ultrasound imaging with respect to spondyloarthritis and describes some of the limitations that need to be addressed. RECENT FINDINGS: Ultrasound imaging has been shown to be more sensitive than clinical examination in detecting many features of spondyloarthritis, such as synovitis and enthesitis. The ability to detect subclinical disease and demonstrate a clear response to therapeutic intervention makes this imaging modality a potential tool for both diagnostic and monitoring purposes. Despite this, a number of issues including a lack of standardization of ultrasound assessment of musculoskeletal disorders continue to hamper its progress. New three-dimensional technology is a promising development, which may allow this problem to be addressed. SUMMARY: Improving the ability of the rheumatologist to predict prognosis and guide therapeutic intervention is a long-term goal to which ultrasound may be able to provide a significant contribution. The addition of a novel imaging modality to currently available assessment tools may provide rheumatologists with a more precise working framework, which may be exploited for the benefits of the patients.",0
2181,"The performance of transabdominal ultrasound (US) in chronic pancreatitis (CP) following the advances in US technology made during recent decades has not been explored. Our aim in this prospective study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of modern abdominal US compared with the Mayo score in CP. One hundred thirty-four patients referred for suspected CP were included in the study. Fifty-four patients were assigned the diagnosis CP. After inclusion, transabdominal US was performed. Ductal features (calculi, dilations and caliber variations, side-branch dilations and hyper-echoic duct wall margins) and parenchymal features (calcifications, cysts, hyper-echoic foci, stranding, lobulation and honeycombing) were recorded. Features were counted and scored according to a weighting system defined at the international consensus meeting in Rosemont, Illinois (Rosemont score). Diagnostic performance indices (95% confidence interval) of US were calculated: The unweighted count of features had a sensitivity of 0.69 (0.54-0.80) and specificity of 0.97 (0.90-1). The Rosemont score had a sensitivity of 0.81 (0.69-0.91) and specificity of 0.97 (0.90-1). Exocrine pancreatic failure was most pronounced in Rosemont groups I and II (p < 0.001). We conclude that using both unweighted and weighted scores, the diagnostic accuracy of modern transabdominal US is good. The extent of pancreatic changes detected by the method is correlated with exocrine pancreatic function.",0
2182,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Bronchoscopy is a minimally invasive method for diagnosing lung diseases, but the technique has some limitations. In case of parabronchial lesions, the view is limited to the inner surface. Therefore, endobronchial ultrasound systems were developed. For obtaining biopsies of peripheral lung lesions, a new real-time guidance system shows promising results. In this review the authors assess the most important and interesting articles in both fields. RECENT FINDINGS: In a trial it was shown that with the help of endobronchial ultrasound the diagnosing and staging of lung cancer and other pathologies could be improved. It is a safe technique and it has proved extremely useful during diagnostic and interventional procedures. With the navigation conclusive, biopsies were obtained in nearly 70% of the patients without any severe side effects. SUMMARY: Endobronchial ultrasound proved to be useful in high-resolution imaging of the multilayer structures of the bronchial wall and the adjacent mediastinal structures at a distance of as much as 4 cm. Lymph nodes could be easily localized for transbronchial needle aspiration. In many instances it was superior for staging lung cancer and other pathologies. Real-time electromagnetic-guided bronchoscopy, coupled with computed tomography is a feasible and safe method for obtaining biopsies from peripheral lung lesions.",0
2183,"OBJECTIVE: The first objective was to identify whether increased experience, gauged by number of procedures performed posttraining, is correlated with greater likelihood of obtaining joint fluid in diagnostic aspirations. The second objective was to identify whether trainee involvement at the time of procedure affected the success rate of the procedure (which in this case was obtaining fluid on aspiration). DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of fluoroscopic- and ultrasound-guided large joint aspirations. Logarithmic fit was performed to identify the presence of a learning curve to the successful attainment of fluid with experience. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify whether trainee presence for a procedure affected fluid attainment. RESULTS: Ultrasound did not demonstrate a significant fit to the logarithmic curve ( P = 0.447), whereas fluoroscopy did ( P < 0.001), indicative of a learning curve for fluoroscopy. After adjusting for covariates, joint fluid was successfully attained at a similar rate whether trainees were present or not. Significant independent factors related to successful joint fluid attainment were image guidance technique ( P = 0.001), body mass index ( P = 0.032), and joint aspirated (overall P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: There was a statistically significant learning curve for fluoroscopic-guided joint aspirations, but not with ultrasound guidance. Trainee involvement did not affect the success rate of joint aspirations.",0
2184,"Observations with diagnostic ultrasound in renal disease over a 10-year period are reviewed. The advantages of diagnostic methods involving the least possible discomfort to the patient are emphasized. Ultrasonography is regarded as a reliable non-invasive method for the diagnostic differentiation between renal tumours and cysts. It was used by the authors for this purpose in 740 cases. Renal tumours were found by this method in 622, and renal cysts in 118 cases. Of the 740 patients, 726 underwent surgery. The preoperative ultrasonic diagnosis of renal tumour proved to be correct in 91.8 per cent, that of renal cyst in 88.9 per cent of the respective surgical cases. Ultrasonography also lends itself to the follow-up of polycystic disease of the kidney, being suited for its early diagnosis, as well as to its identification in the stage of renal failure when the traditional diagnostic methods are no longer practicable.",0
2187,"The preparation and application of anatomic models and phantoms to facilitate learning diagnostic ultrasound is described. Imaging with diagnostic ultrasound requires mastery of many skills, along with knowledge of sound-tissue interactions which contribute to the formation of diagnostic images and artifacts. Understanding the genesis of artifacts encountered during ultrasound scanning can avoid misinterpretation and aid diagnosis. In addition, development of machine related knowledge and skills, including manipulation of the transducer and the selection of correct settings for variables such as gain, power, time-gain compensation, and transducer type, is dependent on an understanding of how these factors affect the image. The normal appearance of an organ relates to both its echogenicity and morphologic characteristics, and confirmation of the nature of an abnormality often requires ultrasound guided biopsy. The use of anatomic models and phantoms in ultrasound instruction allows principles to be demonstrated, knowledge acquired, and biopsy procedures practiced and mastered in a controlled setting. This can minimize live animal use, and enhance the knowledge base and skills of the clinician prior to applying this diagnostic technique to the clinical patient.",0
2188,"BACKGROUND: Ultrasound is frequently used to measure activity in the lumbar multifidus muscle (LMM). However previous reliability studies on diagnostic ultrasound and LMM have included a limited number of subjects and few have used Bland-Altman's Limits of Agreement (LOA). Further one does not know if activity affects the subjects' ability to contract the LMM. METHODS: From January 2012 to December 2012 an inter- and intra-examiner reliability study was carried out in a clinical setting. It consisted of a total of four experiments with 30 subjects in each study. Two experienced examiners performed all measurements. Ultrasound measurements were made of: 1. the LMM in the resting state, 2. during a contracted state, 3. on subsequent days, and, before and after walking. Reliability and agreement was tested for 1. resting LMM, 2. contracted LMM, and 3. thickness change in the LMM. Mean values of three measurements were used for statistical analysis for each spinal level. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) 3.1 and 3.2 was used to test for reliability, and Bland-Altman's LOA method to test for agreement. RESULTS: All of the studies indicate high levels of reliability, but as the LMM thickness increased (increasing contraction) the agreement between examiners was poorer than for low levels of contraction. CONCLUSIONS: The use of diagnostic ultrasound to measure the LMM seems to be reliable in subjects who have little or no change in thickness of the LMM with contraction.",0
2189,"Ultrasound has many industrial applications but it was first introduced as a medical diagnostic aid in the 1940s with its first veterinary application, the detection of ovine pregnancy, being reported in 1966. Since then, improvements in equipment quality combined with an increased awareness of the benefits of ultrasound as an imaging technique have led to its widespread use in the veterinary field. Recent advances in computer technology have significantly influenced equipment design and the miniaturization of transducers allows intra-operative and intra-vascular applications. Software advances have improved the ability to manipulate and process data, leading to an increased amount of information being obtained from each examination and the advent of 'remote diagnosis'. Ultrasound guided interventional techniques can now be used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Many of these developments have been introduced by equipment manufacturers but have found specific applications in the veterinary field. Ultrasound is currently employed in a very diverse range of situations, not just as a diagnostic tool in the routine clinical workup of a range of species, but also for disease screening, conservation projects, commercial services, herd management and clinical research.",0
2190,"Tissues of the central nervous system are sensitive to damage by physical agents, such as heat and ultrasound. Exposure to pulsed spectral Doppler ultrasound can significantly heat biologic tissue because of the relatively high intensities used and the need to hold the beam stationary during examinations. This has significant implications for sensitive neural tissue such as that exposed during spectral Doppler flow studies of fetal cerebral vessels. Recent changes in the FDA regulation allow delivery of almost eight times higher intensity into the fetal brain by ultrasound devices that incorporate an approved real-time output display in their design. In this situation, ultrasound users are expected to assess the risk/benefit ratio based on their interpretation of equipment output displays (including the thermal index, TI) and an understanding of the significance of biologic effects. To assist in the assessment of potential thermally mediated bioeffects, a number of conclusions can be drawn from the published scientific literature: the amount of ultrasound-induced intracranial heating increases with gestational age and the development of fetal bone; pulsed spectral Doppler ultrasound can produce biologically significant heating in the fetal brain; the rate of heating near bone is rapid, with approximately 75% of the maximum heating occurring within 30 s; blood flow has minimal cooling effect on ultrasound-induced heating of the brain when insonated with narrow focused clinical beams; the threshold for irreversible damage in the developing embryo and fetal brain is exceeded when a temperature increase of 4 degrees C is maintained for 5 min; an ultrasound exposure that produces a temperature increase of up to 1.5 degrees C in 120 s does not elicit measurable electrophysiologic responses in fetal brain; for some exposure conditions, the thermal index (TI), as used in the FDA-approved output display standard, underestimates the extent of ultrasound-induced intracranial temperature increase.",0
2191,"Placental mesenchymal dysplasia (PMD) is a rare, benign developmental anomaly with a reported prevalence of 0.02% (Arizawa and Nakayama, 2002). It is characterized by placentomegaly with multiple cystic lesions of the stem villi and vascular anomalies (Pawoo and Heller, 2014). Early detection of PMD has been described during routine prenatal ultrasound (Vaisbuch et al., 2009). The sonographic characteristics of PMD include increased placental thickness and multiple cystic areas within the placenta with either an absence of blood flow or with low venous Doppler signals (Vaisbuch et al., 2009). The differential diagnosis of multicystic placental lesions with the presence of a live fetus include partial molar pregnancy, multiple hematomas, chorioangioma Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and PMD. Chorioangiomas are well circumscribed masses within the placenta and they are characterized by the presence of a single feeding vessel with the same pulse rate as the umbilical cord (Zalel et al., 2002). Invasive prenatal testing is required for the exclusion of partial molar pregnancy and Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (Vaisbuch et al., 2009). Definitive diagnosis of PMD is based on the pathologic examination of the placenta. Histology reveals aneurysm or dilated blood vessels that may be thrombosed. The stem villi are edematous and enlarged with thick-walled vessels, without trophoblastic proliferation (Pawoo and Heller, 2014). This case report highlights the significance of the early detection of PMD, illustrates the pitfalls in differential diagnosis and provides valuable insights regarding PMD management in a clinical setting.",0
2192,"The use of pleural and lung ultrasound is being performed increasingly by respiratory and critical care clinicians around the world. This article describes how to create cheap and reliable lung and pleural phantoms for teaching. The phantoms described replicate the appearance of normal ventilating lung, pneumothorax (including the contact or lung point), pulmonary oedema, pleural effusion and empyema. The pleural effusion phantom can be used to teach procedural ultrasound (pleurocentesis).",0
2193,"Stridor is one of the most important signs of partial or complete upper airway obstruction. Subglottic hemangioma (SGH) is a well-recognized however infrequent cause of infantile stridor. It is a potentially life-threatening condition. Thus, early diagnosis and management are crucial. Diagnostic evaluation includes ultrasound, cross-sectional imaging such as contrast-enhanced CT/MRI, and tracheobronchoscopy. Ultrasound (US), although not a widely used modality for the diagnosis, provides good assessment of its presence, extent, and degree of subglottic airway narrowing. Moreover, color Doppler helps to establish the vascular nature of the lesion. There are many advantages of US over tracheobronchoscopy and CT in an emergency setting which include its easy availability, non-invasive nature, and can be done quickly as a bedside procedure, enabling early initiation of treatment. However, there are some disadvantages as well, which include limited field of view and operator dependency. Also, extension into the thoracic cavity and more deeply located soft tissue locations can be missed. We present a case of subglottic hemangioma in which US solved the diagnostic dilemma and provided a definite diagnosis when CT and tracheobronchoscopy failed to do so in a 6-month-old infant presenting with stridor to the ER.",0
2194,"Ultrasound and microbubbles are often used to enhance drug delivery and the suggested mechanisms are extravasation and sonoporation. Drug delivery schemes with ultrasound and microbubbles at both low and high acoustic amplitudes have been suggested. A diagnostic ultrasound scanner may play a double role as both an imaging and a therapy device. It was not possible to accurately measure microbubble response with an ultrasound scanner for a large range of acoustic pressures and microbubble concentrations until now, mainly because of signal saturation issues. A method for continuously adjusting the receive gain of a scanner and limiting signal saturation was developed to accurately measure backscattered echoes from microbubbles for mechanical indexes (MIs) up to 2.1. The intensity of backscattered echoes from microbubbles increased quarticly with MI without reaching any limit. The signal intensity from microbubbles was found to be linear with concentration at both low and high MIs. However, at very high concentrations, acoustic shadowing occurs which limits the delivered acoustic pressure in deeper areas. The contrastto- tissue ratio was also measured and found to stay constant with MI. These results can be used to better guide drug delivery approaches and to also develop imaging techniques for therapy procedures.",0
2195,"The physical and technical foundations of investigations with diagnostic ultrasound are discussed. Two questions need to be answered: what is ultrasound, and how does an ultrasonic device operate? The mechanical properties of the human body are described by physical laws, such as the propagation of ultrasound waves, the interaction of ultrasound with tissue, attenuation, reflection, refraction, etc. Today high-technology ultrasonic devices are driven by computers. Imaging of the same kidney with different devices shows the progress made in image quality over a period of about 15 years. Details of tissue and biometry are largely enhanced. Powerful tools allow different forms of precise analysis of online measurements. Advanced handling of information gives further opportunities to image processing. The final question is the extent to which the physician and surgeon want to work with such as sophisticated high-technology imaging system and learn to manage its hard- and software.",0
2196,"OBJECTIVE: To verify the diagnostic efficiency of venous duplex ultrasound and lymphangioscintigraphy (LAS) in establishing the cause of leg edema and to clarify the pathology of these leg edemas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2009, and March 2010, 62 patients with leg edema of unknown origin were referred to the Edema Clinic of the Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine. All patients underwent a venous duplex ultrasound scan and LAS. RESULTS: Of 62 patients, lymphatic insufficiency, venous insufficiency or both was diagnosed in 42 (68%), and lymphedema, in 29 (47%). Venous duplex ultrasound detected obvious venous disorders in only 13 (21%), and for 20 patients, the ultrasound and LAS did not reveal any abnormalities; however, for 15 of the 20 (24% of all patients), venous edema was attributed to functional causes. CONCLUSION: Venous duplex ultrasound and LAS assisted in the diagnosis of leg edema of unknown origin and also proved useful in establishing treatment strategies.",0
2197,"Processes that can produce a biological effect with some degree of heating (ie, about 1 degrees C above the physiologic temperature) act via a thermal mechanism. Investigations with laboratory animals have documented that pulsed ultrasound can produce elevations of temperature and damage in biological tissues in vivo, particularly in the presence of bone (intracranial temperature elevation). Acoustic outputs used to induce these adverse bioeffects are within the diagnostic range, although exposure times are usually considerably longer than in clinical practice. Conditions present in early pregnancy, such as lack of perfusion, may favor bioeffects. Thermally induced teratogenesis has been shown in many animal studies, as well as several controlled human studies; however, human studies have not shown a causal relationship between diagnostic ultrasound exposure during pregnancy and adverse biological effects to the fetus. All human epidemiologic studies, however, were conducted with commercially available devices predating 1992, that is, with acoustic outputs not exceeding a spatial-peak temporal-average intensity of 94 mW/cm2. Current limits in the United States allow a spatial-peak temporal-average intensity of 720 mW/cm2 for fetal applications. The synergistic effect of a raised body temperature (febrile status) and ultrasound insonation has not been examined in depth. Available evidence, experimental or epidemiologic, is insufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between obstetric diagnostic ultrasound exposure and obvious adverse thermal effects to the fetus. However, very subtle effects cannot be ruled out and indicate a need for further research, although research in humans may be extremely difficult to realize.",0
2199,"Background. Pneumothorax (PTX) still remains a common cause of morbidity in critically ill and ventilated neonates. At the present time, lung ultrasound (LUS) is not included in the diagnostic work-up of PTX in newborns despite of excellent evidence of reliability in adults. The aim of this study was to compare LUS, chest X-ray (CXR), and chest transillumination (CTR) for PTX diagnosis in a group of neonates in which the presence of air in the pleural space was confirmed. Methods. In a 36-month period, 49 neonates with respiratory distress were enrolled in the study. Twenty-three had PTX requiring aspiration or chest drainage (birth weight 2120 ± 1640 grams; gestational age = 36 ± 5 weeks), and 26 were suffering from respiratory distress without PTX (birth weight 2120 ± 1640 grams; gestational age = 34 ± 5 weeks). Both groups had done LUS, CTR, and CXR. Results. LUS was consistent with PTX in all 23 patients requiring chest aspiration. In this group, CXR did not detect PTX in one patient while CTR did not detect it in 3 patients. Sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing PTX were therefore 1 for LUS, 0.96 and 1 for CXR, and 0.87 and 0.96 for CTR. Conclusions. Our results confirm that also in newborns LUS is at least as accurate as CXR in the diagnosis of PTX while CTR has a lower accuracy.",0
2201,"Musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) can serve as an excellent imaging modality for the musculoskeletal clinician. Although MRI is more commonly ordered in the United States for musculoskeletal problems, both of these imaging modalities have advantages and disadvantages and can be viewed as complementary rather than adversarial. For diagnostic US, relative recent advances in technology have improved ultrasound's ability to diagnose a myriad of musculoskeletal problems with enhanced resolution. The structures most commonly imaged with diagnostic musculoskeletal US, include tendon, muscle, nerve, joint, and some osseous pathology. This brief review article will discuss the role of US in imaging various common musculoskeletal disorders and will highlight, where appropriate, how recent technological advances have improved this imaging modality in musculoskeletal medicine. Additionally, clinicians practicing musculoskeletal medicine should be aware of the ability as well as limitations of this unique imaging modality and become familiar with conditions where US may be more advantageous than MRI.",0
2202,"A massive body of screening studies attests to the safety of diagnostic ultrasound. It appears that further progress in analysis of the safety question, will require mechanistic guidance. In theory, transient cavitation can occur under diagnostically relevant conditions if appropriate nuclei exist in the exposed medium. Low-temporal-average-intensity, pulsed ultrasound equivalent to that used in diagnosis has been shown to cause deleterious effects in lower organisms. All available evidence supports the conclusion that these effects are mediated by acoustic cavitation. It is impossible to extrapolate from these observations to human beings. However, all of the information available to us at the present time suggests that if transient cavitation occurs under diagnostic conditions, the events are rare, highly localized and probably would be of minor importance in almost any part of the body with the possible exception of the developing embryo or fetus. Transient cavitation is characterized by sharply defined thresholds. If future studies demonstrate the occurrence of cavitation related effects, they can be eliminated simply by keeping the maximum pressure amplitudes below those thresholds.",0
2203,"OBJECTIVE: To improve the results of preoperative diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Under our supervision for 2006–2015 we had 23 patients with the Mirizzi syndrome. Verification of cholecystolithiasis, condition of gallbladder’s wall and biliary tract dilatation degree was evaluated sonographically. Biliary decompression was realised by percutaneous transhepatic cholangiostomy that was implemented under the combined ultrasonic and X-ray control by the Seldinger technique for self-locking pigtail drainages 8 F. As a method for direct visualization of the bile ducts was used antegrade cholangiography. RESULTS: Preoperative diagnosis was verified in 18 (78.3%) patients, based on the results of ultrasound and data of antegrade cholangiography. In I type of Mirizzi syndrome (prefistule form) was revealed a combination of non-standard ultrasonic symptoms: if there were signs of ""high"" extrahepatic block of bile ducts (area of liver gate and confluence of hepatic ducts) there was recorded actual intravesical bile hypertension. Lack of lymphadenopathy near the choledoch and focal lesions of liver parenchyma in the goal area confirmed the benign character of the ""high"" bile ducts block. II type of Mirizzi syndrome (fistula form) was characterized by the presence of megacholelitiasis combined with a lack of intravesical bile hypertension. Antegrade cholangiography in combination with intra-ductal diagnostic catheters and manipulation wires and in some cases with cholecystography allowed to differentiate types of Mirizzi syndrome. In 5 cases Mirizzi syndrome was an intraoperative finding. Antegrade minimal-invasive access to the biliary tree was used in patients with high risk of surgery for subsequent X-ray interventions (lithotripsy, balloon dilatation of major duodenal papilla, dislocation of stones to the duodenum). CONCLUSIONS: Effective preoperative diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome can be successful more than in half cases of the combined use of ultrasonography of the biliary tract and the results of antegrade dynamic cholangiography. That was carried out through percutaneous transhepatic cholangiostomy in conjunction with additional diagnostic intraluminal manipulations (wires and catheter inspection and palpation).",0
2204,"The propagation of ultrasonic waves is nonlinear. Phenomena associated with the propagation of diagnostic ultrasound pulses cannot be predicted using linear assumptions alone. These include a progressive distortion in waveform, the generation of frequency harmonics and acoustic shocks, excess deposition of energy and acoustic saturation. These effects occur most strongly when ultrasound propagates within liquids with comparatively low acoustic attenuation, such as water, amniotic fluid or urine. Within soft tissues, similar effects occur, although they are limited by absorption and scattering. Nonlinear effects are of considerable importance during acoustic measurements, especially when these are used to predict in situ exposure. Harmonic generation may be used to create images. These offer improvements over conventional B-mode images in spatial resolution and, more significantly, in the suppression of acoustic clutter and side-lobe artifacts. B/A has promise as a parameter for tissue characterisation, but methods for imaging B/A have shown limited success.",0
2205,"INTRODUCTION: The intersection syndrome is a well-known overuse syndrome of the distal forearm. It is characterized by noninfectious, inflammatory changes involving the area of intersection of the first (abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis) and second (extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi radialis brevis) extensor compartments in the dorsoradial aspect of the distal forearm. Imaging modalities used to diagnosis this syndrome include ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging. The purpose of this report is to describe typical US findings in the intersection syndrome and to demonstrate the diagnostic value of this approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed US findings in 4 patients (mean age 40 years) referred to our staff for symptoms suggestive of the intersection syndrome (pain, swelling, erythema, and edema of the wrist). RESULTS: In all 4 cases, the US examination revealed peritendinous edema and synovial fluid within the tendon sheaths at the intersection between the first and the second dorsal extensor tendon compartments. DISCUSSION: Our experience shows that the intersection syndrome is associated with typical signs on US. This imaging modality can be considered a reliable tool for diagnosing this syndrome and may eliminate the need for other more expensive tests.",0
2206,"In recent years, there has been considerable interest and controversy concerning the performance of ultrasound by emergency physicians (ED Sono), but patient satisfaction with ED Sono has not been well studied. The primary purpose of this investigation was to assess the level of patient satisfaction with ED Sono and to compare satisfaction with ED Sono with ultrasound by the Medical Imaging Department (MI Sono). A secondary objective was to assess the accuracy of ED Sono at our facility. During a 5-month period, which included the startup phase of a program for ED Sono, emergency physicians prospectively identified patients who were candidates for ultrasound as a part of their workup. Patients were contacted by telephone after their ED visit and asked to rate satisfaction on a 0 to 10 scale for various aspects of their care, including the ultrasound if one was done. The accuracy of ED Sono was determined by comparing ED ultrasound interpretations with surgical pathology, repeat imaging studies, or clinical follow-up. Two hundred forty patients were entered into the study, and 186 (78%) responded to the satisfaction survey. Satisfaction ratings were similarly high for ED Sono (mean, 8.9; 95% Cl, 8.6 to 9.2) and for MI Sono (mean, 8.8; 95% Cl, 8.2 to 9.4). Eighteen percent of ultrasounds performed by emergency physicians were indeterminate. Excluding indeterminate scans and scans for which confirmation was not possible, the accuracy of ED Sono was 99.1% (95% Cl, 95.1% to >99.9%). We conclude that during the startup phase of our ED Sono program, patient satisfaction was high, and the error rate was very low.",0
2207,"BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis may present a diagnostic dilemma. The aim of this study was to review the accuracy of ultrasound in the diagnosis of paediatric acute appendicitis. METHOD: Ultrasound studies performed for investigation of appendicitis during 2015-2021 were retrieved from a tertiary paediatric hospital database and reviewed. Medical records were reviewed to determine operative intervention, further imaging, and final diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, predictivity, and overall accuracy. All appendicectomy specimens underwent histopathological confirmation. This study was approved by the local Human Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: A total of 8555 consecutive ultrasound examinations were performed during the study period. Mean patient age was 10.8 years ( ± 3.7). Overall diagnostic accuracy was 96.1% (8221/8555) with a visualisation rate of 91.0%. Sensitivity and specificity were 96.2% (CI 95.3-97.0%) and 96.1% (CI 95.6-96.5%), respectively. When limited to positive/negative scans, sensitivity was 99.6% (CI 99.2-99.8%) and specificity 99.0% (CI 98.7-99.3%). Positive and negative predictive values were 96.9% and 99.9%, respectively. Repeat ultrasound following a non-diagnostic scan led to a definitive diagnosis in 76.1%. Negative appendicectomy rate was 5.5% overall in children who had undergone pre-operative ultrasound (107/1938), and 4.4% when other surgical pathologies were excluded. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound examination provides gold-standard accuracy in the diagnosis of paediatric appendicitis and reduces rates of negative appendicectomy. Given the disadvantages of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound should be considered the first-line investigation of choice in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.",0

2210,"METHODS:: All masses recalled from screening digital breast tomosynthesis between July 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017 that were sent either to diagnostic mammography or ultrasound were compared. Size, shape, margins, visibility on ultrasound, diagnostic assessment and pathology of all masses along with breast density were evaluated. RESULTS:: 102/212 digital breast tomosynthesis screen-detected masses were worked up with diagnostic mammography initially and 110/212 were worked up with ultrasound directly. There was no significant difference in ultrasound visibility of masses sent to diagnostic mammography first with those sent to ultrasound first (p = 0.42). 4 (4%) masses sent to mammogram first and 2 (2%) masses sent to ultrasound first were not visualized. There was a significant difference in size between masses that were visualized under ultrasound versus those that were not (p = 0.01), when masses in both groups were assessed cumulatively. CONCLUSIONS:: 98% of digital breast tomosynthesis screen-detected masses sent to ultrasound directly were adequately assessed without diagnostic mammography. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE:: There is potential for avoiding a diagnostic mammogram for evaluation of majority of digital breast tomosynthesis screen-detected masses.",0

Radiologists have a very important role as part of these centers for the establishment of new diagnostic ultrasound modalities like contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), image fusion between US and computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance tomography (MRI), resulting in new interventional procedures.

2212,"Trends in exposure for diagnostic ultrasonic equipment and a contemporary survey of exposure values are presented. It is demonstrated that both time-averaged intensities and peak pressures have increased steadily over the last two decades. Currently available diagnostic equipment generates pulses for which the average worst-case rarefaction pressure, p-, is about 2 MPa in water, irrespective of the mode of operation. Overall the highest values of p- are found in short-focus beams. Average spatial-peak time-averaged intensities, I(SPTA), are greatest for pulsed Doppler operation at a little over 1 W cm-2. M-mode and colour Doppler operation have average values of I(SPTA) of about 100 mW cm-2 and imaging operates at about an order of magnitude lower again. Vaginal transducers differ little in operational exposure from other transducers. Exposure measurement on colour Doppler systems demands a knowledge of the effect of scanner controls on the field, and some details are given.",0
2213,"200 women threatened with abortion during the first 16 weeks of pregnancy were examined with diagnostic ultrasound to determine whether there were signs of intrauterine life. Of the 90 who showed positive signs, 8 aborted spontaneously later, the other 82 continued their pregnancy. The ultrasound investigation revealed no signs of intrauterine life in 110 patients. Of these, spontaneous abortion or later evacuation because of missed abortion 101 (histopathological examination showed degenerated villi in 98), not pregnant 4, mola hydatidosa 3, extrauterine pregnancies 2. An ultrasound examination was performed to ascertain whether 136 women with suspected ectopic pregnancy had intrauterine pregnancies. 61 of them had an intrauterine gestational sac, confirmed at clinical follow-up. One of the 61 was operated on with laparoscopy because of pain; no abnormalities were found. In 36 of the other 75, laparoscopy was performed. Ectopic pregnancy 21, ovarian or parovarian cyst 11, adhesions 2, salpingitis 1, and normal 1. Diagnostic ultrasound is excellent for accurate prognosis in threatened abortion. Unnecessary operations avoided; hospitalization in suspected ectopic pregnancies reduced.",0
2214,"Diagnostic ultrasound activates the contact phase of human coagulation. This has been seen in human blood or plasma or with purified factor 12. The present work aimed to quantify a possibly triggering action of ultrasound on purified prekallikrein, the second of the two main triggers of the intrinsic hemostasis cascade. Either 2.7 μg/ml human prekallikrein or for control 1 μg/ml kallikrein in 26% glycerol - 0.54% NaCl-10.6 mmol/l Na3 citrate pH 7.4, in emptied polypropylene coagulation monovettes (Sarstedt) were exposed to diagnostic ultrasound (Siemens Acouson Antares, 5 MHz, 0.6 TIB, 0.6 TIS) for 0-5 min at room temperature (RT). Fifty microliter samples were withdrawn in duplicate and placed into an U-wells high quality microtiter plate (Brand 781600). Then 10 μl 2 mmol/l chromogenic substrate HD-CHG-Ala-Arg-pNA in 0.45% NaCl were added, and the increase in absorbance with time (ΔA405 nm /t at 37°C) was determined by a microtiterplate photometer with a 1 mA resolution (PHOmo; anthos). Exposure to diagnostic ultrasound biphasically increased the chromogenic activity of a prekallikrein solution in 26% glycerol. About 3-4 min ultrasound at 23 °C generated about 0.02 μg/ml kallikrein, that means that about 1% of pure prekallikrein in glycerol was converted into kallikrein. Thus, diagnostic ultrasound activates purified human prekallikrein to kallikrein. The ultrasound energy seems to fold the latent proenzyme prekallikrein into the active enzyme kallikrein. This contributes to explain the triggering action of ultrasound on the contact system of plasmatic human coagulation. Conversion of only 1% of prekallikrein into kallikrein is absolutely sufficient to start the intrinsic coagulation cascade. The clinical consequence of this action of ultrasound on intrinsic coagulation is that patients at risk for thrombosis, for example, patients with insufficiencies of hepatocytes, AT-3, C1-ina, or fibrinolysis should be protected by low-molecular-weight-heparin prior to the exposure of ultrasound, especially upon its prolonged exposure.",0
2215,"This study aimed to assess whether residual ultrasound transmission gel (USTG) caused artifacts in mammography using a model 156 mammographic accreditation phantom and step phantom. Moreover, pig tissues with structures similar to those of the breast were imaged to assess whether USTG on the tissue appeared as a shadow on the mammogram, and how these shadows may be interpreted in clinical practice. The results showed that the visualization scores obtained for phantom mammograms decreased significantly for the fiber and mass samples after the application of USTG. Moreover, USTG on the tissues affected the visual evaluation of mammograms, leading to misinterpretation of mammographic findings.",0
2216,"BACKGROUND: Ultrasound therapies are promising, non-invasive applications with potential to significantly improve, e.g. cancer therapies like viro- or immunotherapy or surgical applications. However, a crucial step towards their breakthrough is still missing: affordable and easy-to-handle quality assurance tools for therapy devices and ways to verify treatment planning algorithms. This deficiency limits the safety and comparability of treatments. METHODS: To overcome this deficiency accurate spatial and temporal temperature maps could be used. In this paper, the suitability of temperature calculation based on time-shifts of diagnostic ultrasound backscattered signals (echo-time-shift) is investigated and associated uncertainties are estimated. Different analysis variations were used to calculate the time-shifts: discrete and continuous methods as well as different frames as a reference for temperature calculation (4 s before, 16 s before the frame of interest, base frame). A sigmoid function was fitted and used to calculate temperatures. Two-dimensional temperature maps recorded during and after therapeutic ultrasound sonication were examined. All experiments were performed in agar-graphite phantoms mimicking non-fatty tissue, with high-intensity focused ultrasound being the source of heating. RESULTS: Continuous methods are more accurate than discrete ones, and uncertainties of calculated temperatures are in general lower, the earlier the reference frame was recorded. Depending on the purpose of the measurement, a compromise has to be made between the following: calculation accuracy (early reference frame), tolerance towards small movements (late reference frame), reproducing large temperature changes or cooling processes (reference frame at a certain point in time), speed of the algorithm (discrete (fast) vs. continuous (slower) shift calculation), and spatial accuracy (interval size for index-shift calculation). Within the range from 20 °C to 44 °C, uncertainties as low as 12.4 % are possible, being mainly due to medium properties. CONCLUSIONS: Temperature measurements using the echo-time-shift method might be useful for validation of treatment plan algorithms. This might also be a comparatively accurate, fast, and affordable method for laboratory and clinical quality assessment. Further research is necessary to improve filter algorithms and to extend this method to multiple foci and the usage of temperature-dependent tissue quantities. We used an analytical approach to investigate the uncertainties of temperature measurement. Different analysis variations are compared to determine temperature distribution and development over time.",0

2221,"State-of-the-art portable ultrasound imaging systems employ a small transducer array and a low carrier frequency to fit stringent constraints on power and form factor, and this tends to compromise the ultrasound imaging quality. In this paper, we present a low-complexity low-power asynchronous compressed beamformer (ACB) for portable diagnostic ultrasound. The proposed ACB integrates asynchronous sampling and compressive sensing (CS), and is capable of reducing data conversion power and handling a large data volume at the mixed-signal interface. A high-rate continuoustime ternary encoding (CT-TE) scheme eliminates the need for interpolation filters and coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) units typically used in a conventional architecture. A split-projection least squares (SPLS) signal reconstruction algorithm is applied that replaces high-cost nonlinear signal recovery with a series of low-complexity and independent linear problems. Experiments with measured ultrasound data demonstrate the proposed ACB architecture, and the SPLS reconstruction algorithm achieves 9-fold data compression compared with Nyquist sampling.",0
2222,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Noninvasive imaging techniques have shown limitations to identify insulinomas. In few studies reported so far, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has proven to be able to locate lesions. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of computed tomography versus EUS for the detection of insulinomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective manner prospectively collected data were analyzed. Patients with hypoglucemia and hyperinsulinemia were included. Diagnostic yield was measured in relationship to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy. Surgical specimens were considered the gold standard. RESULTS: Sensitivity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of EUS was 100%, 95.4% and 95.4%, respectively. In the case of CT the sensitivity was 60%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, negative predictive value 7%, and accuracy were 68%. CONCLUSIONS: EUS is useful in the preoperative assessment of patients with hypoglycemia and serum hyperinsulinemia.",0
2223,"PURPOSE: To compare the results by B-scan ultrasonography and findings in pars plana vitrectomy, and assess the diagnostic value of B-scan ultrasonography in endophthalmitis. METHODS: Thirty eyes of 30 subjects diagnosed as endophthalmitis were selected, who undergone preoperative B-scan ultrasonography. The result of pars plana vitrectomy was recorded. The above two results were compared. RESULTS: On the evaluation of vitreous and retinal states in the patients with endophthalmitis, the sensitivity of ultrasound was 90%-100%, and the specificity was 79%-100%. Poorer preoperative visual acuity was related with retinal detachment and retinal dissolution. The preoperative visual acuity in eyes with local vitreous opacity was better than with diffuse vitreous opacity. CONCLUSION: Comparison of the results of B-scan ultrasonography and the findings in pars plana vitrectomy showed B-scan ultrasonography is highly sensitive, specific, and is very helpful in the evaluation of endophthalmitis. B-scan ultrasonography can not only supply much information in the diagnosis of endophthalmitis but also inspect its trends and changes, which is helpful in the selection of treatment and planning the time of surgery.",0

2226,"The diagnostic value (efficiency) of Doppler ultrasound in obstetrics is assessed by studying the association or correlation between Doppler measurement parameters and pregnancy outcome parameters, without influencing the clinical management. The clinical value (efficacy) is however assessed by studying the ability to improve the outcome of pregnancy if Doppler ultrasound is used in obstetrical management for the purpose of possible intervention. The accepted method for assessment of the diagnostic value is the observational study, and the best method for the assessment of the clinical value is the randomised controlled management study (clinical trial). Observational studies concerning the diagnostic value have been widely reported in the literature. According to these studies significant relationships between abnormal Doppler findings and the following obstetrical problems were found: intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, acidosis determined by fetal blood sampling, abnormal intrapartum fetal heart rate, neonatal depression and acidosis, and admission to neonatal intensive care unit. However from these studies it cannot be concluded that pregnancy outcome will be improved by using this information clinically. This problem can only be properly addressed by appropriate clinical management studies. The majority of the published randomised controlled trials showed beneficial effect from Doppler ultrasound application in high-risk pregnancy management. These effects included a significant decrease in the duration of antenatal and neonatal hospital stay, the rate of labour induction, and the rate of emergency Caesarean section. At the same time there was no difference in the gestational age at delivery or in the total Caesarean section rate. None of these trials alone was large enough to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in perinatal mortality. However cumulative meta-analysis allows pooling to evaluate the results from separate but similar studies. The results from such an analysis showed that in high-risk pregnancies managed with Doppler there is a significant decrease of 50 per cent in perinatal mortality and in stillbirths of anatomically normal fetuses. It is important to note that there was no increase in neonatal or maternal morbidity associated with the use of Doppler ultrasound, and that the reduction in perinatal mortality was not the result of a delay in timing fetal death.",0
2228,Snapping pes anserinus syndrome is an often encountered cause of medial knee snapping. It results from impingement and translation of the gracilis tendon or semitendinosus tendon over the osseous structures of the knee during active flexion and extension. Ultrasonography is often the diagnostic imaging test of choice in cases of mechanical snapping. We report 2 cases of painful snapping pes anserinus and highlight the value of dynamic ultrasound in making an accurate diagnosis so as to direct care.,0
2229,"To assess the efficacy, role, and limitations of diagnostic ultrasound in the hand and wrist, the results of 98 examinations performed for a variety of surgical conditions were retrospectively analyzed. Ultrasound was shown to be reliable in evaluating radiolucent foreign body, tendon rupture versus tendon adhesion, tendinitis, peritendinitis, and ganglion cyst (specificity, 1; positive predictive value, 1). A correct suggestion of soft tissue mass histology was offered in six of eight operated cases. Tumor size and extent was accurately assessed in all but one case. The observed limitation of ultrasound was a small false negative rate in each category, which related to a variety of factors, including operator dependence, resolution threshold in the submillimeter range, image degradation due to postoperative edema, a narrow field of view, and one instance of indiscrete tumor margination. More work is needed to determine the role (if any) of ultrasound in the evaluation of peripheral nerve, triangular fibrocartilage, dorsal carpal ligament, and bone pathology.",0
2230,"BACKGROUND: Ultrasound in plastic surgery is quickly finding new applications. Ultrasound surveillance may replace ineffective individual risk stratification and chemoprophylaxis for deep venous thromboses. Abdominal penetration can be a catastrophic complication of liposuction. Preoperative screening for fascial defects may reduce risk. Limiting buttock fat injections to the subcutaneous plane is critical for patient safety, but it is difficult to know one's injection plane. METHODS: The author's use of diagnostic ultrasound was evaluated from May 2017 to May 2018. Ultrasound scans were used routinely to detect deep venous thromboses. Patients undergoing abdominal liposuction and/or abdominoplasty were scanned for possible hernias. Other common applications included the evaluation of breast implants, breast masses, and seroma management. The device was used in surgery in 3 patients to assess the plane of buttock fat injection. RESULTS: One thousand ultrasound scans were performed during the 1-year study period. A distal deep venous thrombosis was detected in 2 patients. In both cases, the thrombosis resolved within 1 month, confirmed by follow-up ultrasound scans. A lateral (tangential) fat injection method was shown to safely deposit fat above the gluteus maximus fascia. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound scans are highly accurate, noninvasive, and well-tolerated by patients. Some of these applications are likely to improve patient safety. Early detection of deep venous thromboses is possible. Unnecessary anticoagulation may be avoided. Subclinical abdominal defects may be detected. Ultrasound may be used in the office to evaluate breast implants, masses, and seromas. In surgery, this device confirms the level of buttock fat injection.",0
2232,"This paper provides information on the safety of ultrasonic diagnostic procedures as currently used in veterinary practice. The known mechanisms of action are described and selected literature on biological effects of ultrasound is reviewed. Current international consensus is presented on the safety of medical ultrasound with respect to thermal effects. To date, there is no independently verified clinical evidence that the level of exposure delivered to the tissues during scanned grey-scale ('B-mode') imaging has any adverse effects. Lung haemorrhage has been observed in animal experiments using diagnostic exposures, but the effects have not been reported in the foetus. Equipment that uses pulsed Doppler transmits higher acoustic outputs in a stationary beam, and can produce temperature increases that may have significant biological consequences. When considering sonographic and pulsed Doppler examinations of the prenatal animal, the safety margins are small and the operator should be aware of the acoustic output of the equipment, the exposure time, and the sensitivity of target tissues.",0
2233,"New digital ultrasound techniques simplify the documentation of ultrasound images and allow better comparison with respect to different image modalities. New vascular imaging modes including contrast enhanced power Doppler and 3D power Doppler allow for the detection of very small vessels and leakages. B-flow, a recently introduced digital substraction technique is advancing the detection of residual blood flow in high-grade stenosis without vibration artifacts. Modern contrast agents allow to perform ultrasound guided intervetion such as biopsies and ablation therapies with improved accuracy. This way, the risk for complications can be significantly reduced.",0
2234,"Diagnostic ultrasound has been used increasingly in obstetric practice over the past decade. To date, adverse effects of ultrasound on the fetus have not been reported, but studies have been done on small sample sizes. This study looks specifically at the association of ultrasound exposure during pregnancy and the risk of low birthweight in the offspring. A validation case-control study was also performed based on information from a sample of medical charts. With a database of more than 13,000 pregnancies, there was no indication of an adverse effect of ultrasound performed during the first two trimesters of pregnancy.",0
2235,"Success of stroke treatment with rt-PA depends on rapid vessel recanalization. Enzymatic thrombolysis may be enhanced by additional transcranial application of ultrasound (US). We investigated this novel technique using a 185-kHz probe and compared it to standard diagnostic US. In vitro studies were performed in a continuous pressure tubing system. Clots were placed in a postmortem skull and treated with rt-PA together with or without transtemporal 185-kHz US insonation (2W/cm(2)) and in comparison to 1-MHz diagnostic US (0.5 W/cm(2)). Recanalization time was significantly (p < 0.01) shorter in the 185-kHz (14.1 min) and 1-MHz (17.1 min) US rt-PA treatment group compared to rt-PA treatment alone (29.3 min.). Flow rate was significantly higher (p < 0.025) and increased faster in the combined treatment group with rt-PA + 185-kHz US compared to rt-PA + 1-MHz US. We investigated the blood-brain barrier in rats after 90-min exposure time of the brain with 185-kHz US, but no damage was observed. Results suggest efficacy and safety of the 185-kHz transducer, which is superior to diagnostic US. Such a novel US probe may be able to optimize thrombolytic stroke treatment.",0

2238,"Sonography is an extremely versatile diagnostic tool for the assessment of cancer in children, offering several advantages over other imaging modalities, chief of which is its truly noninvasive nature. In view of the available comparative studies and the risk/benefit and cost/benefit ratios of the imaging procedures available, ultrasound is attractive for use as the initial study of many pediatric mass lesions. Its availability, ease of application, and lower cost also favor its use in the assessment of the child with known or suspected malignancy.",0
2239,"PURPOSE: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-known risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). However, few studies have compared differences in the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve in patients with and without DM. The purpose of this study was to compare the utility of ultrasound for the diagnosis of CTS in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients. METHOD: A total of 248 hands of 155 patients were evaluated: 154 hands belonged to non-DM patients with CTS, 80 to DM patients with CTS, 13 patients with DM but no CTS, and 51 patients without DM or CTS. All hands underwent ultrasonography of the median nerve at the wrist for determination of CSA; patients completed a CTS Symptom Severity Scale and Functional Status Scale for each hand. RESULTS: Average CSA (mm2) of non-DM patients with CTS was 11.25 whereas the average in DM patients with CTS was 12.23 (P = .17). Cross-sectional area of 9.5 or greater was the most powerful predictor of CTS in patients without DM, and CSA of 10.5 or greater in patients with DM. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-sectional area of the median nerve was similar for patients with and without DM; however, cutoff values for positive diagnosis may need to be adjusted in patients with DM. Ultrasonography of the wrist is a valuable resource for diagnosing CTS in patients with and without DM. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic II.",0
2240,"All competent scientific groups and institutions involved in ultrasound bioeffect research have accepted the safety of diagnostic ultrasound. If, however, bioeffects have been produced by the use of higher intensities, such effects had been caused by heat production or cavitation. Nevertheless, one has to face the fact that individuals have been successfully doubting this assumption of safety. They succeeded in formulating hypotheses which cannot be disproved at all or at short notice. This holds good especially for any possible unspecified late effects. Such effects, however, can never be excluded in any technical innovation. These remarks refer to all diagnostic ultrasound applications except Doppler blood flow measurements, since for the latter techniques no sufficient knowledge is yet available on possible bioeffects.",0
2241,"Both diagnostic ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for investigation of the presence and severity of rotator cuff lesions. There is no consensus as to which is the more accurate and cost-effective study. We sought to examine the sensitivity of ultrasound, when used by one experienced radiologist with modern equipment. We compared the ultrasound and surgical results obtained from 68 patients. Ultrasound showed a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 100% (Positive Predictive Value 100%) for full-thickness tears, and a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 94% (Positive Predictive Value 87%) for partial-thickness tears. We found that shoulder ultrasound, in the hands of an experienced radiologist with the use of modern high-resolution equipment, is highly sensitive in differentiating complete tears and partial-thickness tears. Our results are similar to the best published results for MRI and given that ultrasound is significantly cheaper and more available, ultrasound by an experienced radiologist should be considered as a primary diagnostic tool for imaging the rotator cuff.",0
2243,"The effect of nonlinear propagation in fluid followed by soft tissue was studied both theoretically and experimentally for a most crucial case in obstetrical ultrasonography. For this purpose, short pressure pulses, with the duration time of 1.3 micros and a carrier frequency of 3 MHz, radiated by a concave transducer into water, with maximum intensities up to the value of 18 W/cm2, were computed and measured. The ultrasonic beam had the physical focus at the distance of 6.5 cm, where the highest focal intensity of I(SPPA) = 242 W/cm2 was obtained. In front of the transducer, at a distance of 7 cm, artificial tissue samples prepared on the basis of ground porcine kidney, with a thickness of 0.5, 1.5 and 3 cm, were placed in water. Pressure pulses and their spectral components were produced numerically and measured by means of a PVDF hydrophone in water before and after penetrating the tissue samples. The theoretical analysis and measurements were carried out, in every case, for two signal levels: for a high level assuring nonlinear propagation and for a low one where conditions of linear propagation were fulfilled. In this way, it was possible to compare directly the effects of nonlinear and linear propagation, in every case showing a good conformity of theoretical values with measured ones. A method of determination of the effective frequency response of the hydrophone was elaborated to enable quantitative comparisons of numerical and experimental results. The theoretical part of our study was based on a paper of Wójcik (1998), enabling us to compute the characteristic function of nonlinear increase of absorption. An agreement of up to 10% was obtained when comparing theoretical and measured values of these functions in the investigated beam in water and behind tissue samples. The results obtained showed that the recently given theory of nonlinear absorption, based on the spectral analysis and the elaborated numerical procedures, may be useful in various practical ultrasonic medical problems and also in technological applications.",0
2246,"The diagnostic uses of high-resolution ultrasonography (7.5-20 MHZ) have dramatically advanced in the past 20 years. We present representative examples of ultrasound diagnosis, based on our experience with over 15,000 examinations. For example, peripheral arterial disease was identified in 30% of older patients with venous diseases, while peripheral emboli and vasculitis can lead to widespread skin disease. Ultrasonographic diagnosis is required for appropriate interdisciplinary treatment. In addition, regular evaluation of the supra-aortic vessels and coronary arteries as well as arteries and veins of the limbs is needed in some forms of vasculitis. The causes of peripheral venous disease can be subdivided into four groups based on sonographic findings: Primary or secondary epi- and/or subfascial venous insufficiency, thrombotic venous occlusion, venous compression syndrome and arteriovenous-lymphatic malformations. The diagnosis and therapeutic approach to lymphedema and soft tissue diseases, with or without lymphadenopathy, requires careful sonographic evaluation. Ultrasonography is an essential part of dermatologic oncology, both for planning primary therapy and for follow-up. A sound command of ultrasonography is today an essential aspect of dermatologic diagnosis and therapy.",0
2247,"Biomedical ultrasound may induce adverse effects in patients by either thermal or non-thermal means. Temperatures above normal can adversely affect biological systems, but effects also may be produced without significant heating. Thermally induced teratogenesis has been demonstrated in many animal species as well as in a few controlled studies in humans. Various maximum 'safe' temperature elevations have been proposed, although the suggested values range from 0.0 to 2.5 degrees C. Factors relevant to thermal effects are considered, including the nature of the acoustic field in situ, the state of perfusion of the embryo/fetus, and the variation of sensitivity to thermal insult with gestational stage of development. Non-thermal mechanisms of action considered include acoustic cavitation, radiation force, and acoustic streaming. While cavitation can be quite destructive, it is extremely unlikely in the absence of stabilized gas bodies, and although the remaining mechanisms may occur in utero, they have not been shown to induce adverse effects. For example, pulsed, diagnostic ultrasound can increase fetal activity during exposure, apparently due to stimulation of auditory perception by radiation forces on the fetal head or auditory structures. In contrast, pulsed ultrasound also produces vascular damage near developing bone in the late-gestation mouse, but by a unknown mechanism and at levels above current US FDA output limits. It is concluded that: (1) thermal rather than nonthermal mechanisms are more likely to induce adverse effects in utero, and (2) while the probability of an adverse thermal event is usually small, under some conditions it can be disturbingly high.",0
2248,"The availability of reliable, portable computer-enhanced ultrasonography with high-frequency transducers has improved breast ultrasonography such that its role has increased dramatically. Diagnostic characteristics of breast lesions may be used to categorize these lesions according to their relative risk for malignancy. Furthermore, breast ultrasonography may be used to guide needle aspiration and biopsy of lesions so indicated by diagnostic evaluation. Results of ultrasound-guided aspiration and core biopsy accurately diagnose specific histopathology thereby avoiding unnecessary open biopsy for benign lesions and facilitating therapeutic planning for malignant lesions.",0
2249,"OBJECTIVE: To setup a practical ultrasound quality assurance protocol in a large radiological center, results from transducer tests, phantom measurements and visual checks for physical faults were compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Altogether 151 transducers from 54 ultrasound scanners, from seven different manufacturers, were tested with a Sonora FirstCall aPerio™ system (Sonora Medical Systems, Inc., Longmont, CO, USA) to detect non-functional elements. Phantom measurements using a CIRS General Purpose Phantom Model 040 (CIRS Tissue Simulation and Phantom Technology, VA, USA) were available for 135 transducers. The transducers and scanners were also checked visually for physical faults. The percentages of defective findings in these tests were computed. RESULTS: Defective results in the FirstCall tests were found in 17% of the 151 transducers, and in 16% of the 135 transducers. Defective image quality resulted with 15% of the transducers, and 25% of the transducers had a physical flaw. In 16% of the scanners, a physical fault elsewhere than in the transducer was found. Seven percent of the transducers had a concurrent defective result both in the FirstCall test and in the phantom measurements, 8% in the FirstCall test and in the visual check, 4% in the phantom measurements and in the visual check, and 2% in all three tests. CONCLUSION: The tested methods produced partly complementary results and seemed all to be necessary. Thus a quality assurance protocol is forced to be rather labored, and therefore the benefits and costs must be closely followed.",0
2254,"Dilatation and curettage has for many years been the method of choice for diagnosing endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. However, less than 10% of women with postmenopausal bleeding have an endometrial cancer. Vaginal sonography for measuring endometrial thickness, has in several studies proved to be a sensitive diagnostic method for diagnosing endometrial pathology. Our studies as well as others have shown that an endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less (including both endometrial layers) indicates a very low risk for endometrial carcinoma as well as any other major endometrial pathology in women with postmenopausal bleeding. Since vaginal sonography is such a simple and a non-invasive diagnostic method, it thus seems reasonable that vaginal sonographic assessment of the endometrium should be the primary method for excluding any endometrial abnormality in a woman with postmenopausal bleeding.",0
2255,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze statistically significant diagnostic factors for pilomatricoma on the basis of ultrasonographic features. METHODS: Sonographic images were retrospectively reviewed from 44 pilomatricomas, and from 43 control subjects with other subcutaneous tumors. Two radiologists determined the tumoral shape, margin, echotexture, echogenicity, posterior shadowing, posterior enhancement, hypoechoic rim, internal calcification, and vascularity. RESULTS: The reliable diagnostic factors for pilomatricoma were hypoechogenicity (P < 0.001), heterogenicity (P < 0.05), internal calcification (P < 0.001), hypoechoic rim (P < 0.001), and posterior shadowing (P < 0.001). Scattered dots were the most common patterns of internal calcification. A combination of hypoechogenicity, heterogenicity, internal calcification of scattered-dot pattern, and a hypoechoic rim was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.001; odds ratio, 21). CONCLUSIONS: The features of heterogeneous echotexture, internal echogenic foci in scattered-dot pattern, and a hypoechoic rim or posterior shadowing itself could be discriminative ultrasonographic criteria for differentiating pilomatricomas from other subcutaneous tumors.",0
2256,"The current approach for localizing and assessing the severity of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries involves clinical evaluation and electrodiagnostic studies. However, the ability of this approach to determine the extent of nerve damage within the first 6 weeks after trauma is limited. This is problematic because outcome is improved with early surgical intervention after complete nerve transection. This led us to explore alternative techniques, such as imaging, for assessing peripheral nerve injuries. Twelve fresh cadavers were obtained and after inspection 20 arms were deemed suitable for inclusion in the study. Random sites were transected in median, ulnar, and radial nerves, and sham skin incisions were performed throughout the arm. These nerves were then systematically scanned by an ultrasonographer blinded to the nerve transection sites, who made a final decision as to whether the nerve was transected. High-resolution ultrasound was able to identify transected nerves in the upper extremity with 89% sensitivity and 95% specificity in fresh cadavers. This proof-of-concept study shows that ultrasound can accurately identify nerve transection, which should lead to further ultrasound studies in patients with traumatic peripheral nerve injuries.",0
2258,"The safety of ultrasonography in pregnancy is well documented. In screening populations, with the exception of the RADIUS trial, ultrasound examination can diagnose in approximately 50% of major anomalies. The accuracy of anomaly detection improves with increasing operator experience and advances in equipment resolution of the fetal image. The effect of routine sonography on perinatal outcome in low-risk pregnancies has not been established. Therefore, the role of ultrasound in routine screening remains controversial. However, in high-risk populations the accuracy of ultrasound in diagnosing congenital anomalies is well over 90%. The prenatal detection of abnormalities often influences obstetrical management and optimizes care of the fetus and newborn. The ability of ultrasound examination to determine gestational age, detect multiple gestations, and assess fetal well-being by diagnosing growth and fluid abnormalities has changed the practice of obstetrics more than any other technology in recent years.",0
2259,"PURPOSE: Traditional evaluation of suspected carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) involves a thorough history, physical examination, and nerve conduction velocity studies (NCS). Ultrasound is used widely in Europe and has gained acceptance in the United States in the diagnosis of various musculoskeletal disorders. The purpose of this study was to document the ultrasonographic measurement difference in median nerve size between patients with CTS and controls and to correlate these findings with NCS findings, thereby allowing us to test the validity of ultrasound as a diagnostic modality for CTS. METHODS: Forty-four wrists in 26 CTS patients and 86 wrists in 43 asymptomatic volunteers were imaged using a real-time ultrasound scanner with a 12/5 MHz linear-array transducer. The cross-sectional area of the median nerve was measured at the level of the distal wrist crease in both CTS patients and controls. All CTS patients had NCS. The ultrasonographic median nerve area was compared for the 2 groups and correlation analysis between ultrasonographic nerve sizes and NCS findings was performed. RESULTS: The average cross-sectional area of the median nerve at the distal wrist crease was 9 mm(2) in asymptomatic volunteers and 14 mm(2) in CTS patients. For the CTS patients the Pearson correlation coefficient between ultrasound nerve measurement and NCS values was 0.37, suggesting that higher values of ultrasound measurements are associated with abnormal NCS findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that high-resolution ultrasound is informative in the evaluation of CTS and shows enlargement of the median nerve at the distal wrist crease in symptomatic patients. Therefore it is a reliable modality for imaging the wrist in patients with CTS. In addition ultrasound is well tolerated and safe. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic, Level I.",0
2260,"Ultrasound is being used increasingly in clinical diagnosis throughout the world in many medical specialties. Its major advantages over other imaging modalities are that it is minimally invasive, less expansive, and portable. Its resolution rivals that of X-ray computerized tomography and magnetic resonant imaging. Its limitations are that certain organs, such as lung and bone, are inaccessible by ultrasound, and that certain organs such as heart can only be accessed through limited acoustic windows. In recent years, great advances have been achieved in ultrasound imaging technology that make it even more versatile. Color Doppler flow imaging, parallel processing, Duplex scanning, and transesophageal imaging are just a few examples. In this paper, those developments, among others, are reviewed and their implications in clinical practice are discussed.",0

2265,"Ultrasound elastography, as a new imaging technique to obtain information about tissue elasticity, can directly or indirectly reflect the differences of the inner elastic modulus and other mechanical properties in the tissue, and thus clearly display and position pathological changes and identify lesions. With its rapid development and wide application to clinical practice, ultrasound elastography has become a hot research topic. However, reports are rarely seen at home and abroad about the application of ultrasound elastography in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. This paper introduces the principles and recent development of ultrasound elastography, its application in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, and the trend of research on its diagnostic value.",0
2266,"The typical ""gold standard"" for assessing muscle size has been magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography; however, these processes are very expensive and generally require a medical facility. The advent of B-mode diagnostic ultrasound (US) can perhaps offer a quick, cost-effective method to measure muscle size. The purpose of this study was to document the reliability of B-mode US for assessing muscle size in a variety of populations. Thirty-eight postmenopausal women (avg. age = 58.9 +/- 0.7 years) had both their right rectus femoris and biceps brachii imaged, 85 older men and women (avg. age = 65.0 +/- 0.4 yrs) had their right rectus femoris imaged, and 10 young men and women (avg. age = 26.1 +/- 2.4 yrs) had their right rectus femoris imaged by both US and MRI. The location used for imaging on the right rectus femoris was a point 15 cm above to the superior border of the patella following the midline of the anterior surface of the thigh, whereas the biceps brachii was measured at maximal girth following the midline of the anterior surface of the upper arm. All trials utilizing US (Fukuda Denshi, model 4500) and a 5 Mz transducer (FUT-L104) were obtained in duplicate on 2 separate days. The young subjects that also had their rectus femoris measured by MRI were imaged with a Picker 1.5 Tesla (The Edge), which used a fast spin sequence and 192 x 256 resolution to obtain 2 5-mm-thick slices separated by a 1-mm-thick space. All intraclass correlation coefficients for the various groups and muscles measured by US ranged from r = 0.72-0.99, whereas coefficients of variation (CVs) ranged between 3.5% and 6.7%. The intraclass correlation for the MRI images was r = 0.90 and the CV was 5.2%. In conclusion, it appears that diagnostic US can provide a reliable and cost-effective alternative method for assessing muscle.",0
2267,"As a form of energy, diagnostic ultrasound (DUS) has the potential to have effects on Living tissues, e.g. bioeffects. The two most likely mechanisms for bioeffects are heating and cavitation. Hyperthermia is considered teratogenic in human fetuses during the first trimester Actual temperature changes cannot be studied in the human fetus. The thermal index [TI) expresses the potential for rise in temperature at the ultrasound's focal point. The mechanical index (MI) indicates the potential for the ultrasound to induce inertial cavitation in tissues. Nevertheless, cavitation has not been documented in mammalian fetuses, since there is not an air-water interface, which is needed for the cavitation mechanism. Since an output of TI over 1.5 is a known hazard, the question is: What are the settings in which such hazardous exposure occurs? Our conclusions regarding safety of DUS, based on the data that has been available till now, are the following: (1) Ultrasound end-users are poorly informed regarding safety issues during pregnancy. Further efforts in the realm of education and training are needed in order to improve knowledge of end-users about the acoustic output of the machines and safety issues. (2) First trimester ultrasound is associated with negligible rise in the thermal index. (3) Increased acoustic output Levels, as expressed by TI levels, are reached while performing obstetrical Doppler studies. In particular, TI Levels may reach 1.5 and above. Doppler procedures should be performed with caution and should be as brief as possible during obstetrical ultrasound. (4) Acoustic exposure levels during 3D/4D ultrasound examination, as expressed by TI are comparable to the two-dimensional B-mode ultrasound.",0
2269,A survey of present opinions on the safety of diagnostic ultrasound applications is presented together with some data on output levels.

2270,"Progress in diagnostic ultrasound is driven by the development of new technology. The place of new techniques in diagnostic algorithms has to be determined jointly by radiologists and clinicians and appropriate arrangements have to be made for training. About pounds 30 million per year is currently spent on diagnostic ultrasound in the UK. Diagnostic ultrasound depends on the information obtained as a result of ultrasonic irradiation of the patient. Biological effects, some of which are undesirable, can be produced by ultrasound but there is no evidence that the exposures used in diagnosis carry any risk. In judging whether ultrasonic scanning is appropriate in any particular situation, it is necessary to consider benefits, costs and available resources. The costs include not only the costs of the test but also the cost of any hypothetical ultrasonic hazard and the cost of misdiagnosis. The most prudent use of ultrasound is that which maximises the benefit-total-cost ratio and although this cannot presently be quantified, some of the concepts involved can be understood in terms of the health increment and the health decrement the latter apparently being equal to zero when the diagnosis is correctly made using contemporary equipment. This approach can be extended to introduce the idea of profit arising from the test. As an example, obstetric ultrasound is considered to be appropriate when there is a medical indication for it. Although routine scanning at 16 weeks of pregnancy has been shown to result in a very large profit, there is still conflicting guidance about its advisability on the grounds of safety and existing accounting systems may restrict access to the profit. In discussing the desirability of ultrasonic scanning, patients can be informed that there is no reason to believe that there are any risks related to ultrasonic exposure. The imminent availability of inexpensive ultrasonic scanners for the layman is a worrying prospect to which the medical profession should now try to develop a prudent response.",0
2271,"Polypoid cystitis is a rare disease of the urinary bladder in dogs characterized by chronic inflammation, epithelial proliferation, and development of a polypoid mass or masses without histopathologic evidence of neoplasia. The ultrasonographic appearances of eight dogs with polypoid cystitis are described. Ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a bladder mass or masses in all patients. Ultrasonographic findings are mucosal projections and a polypoid to pedunculated mass of variable size and shape. Although a polypoid mass tends to be located in the cranioventral bladder mucosa, the polyps also could arise in the craniodorsal bladder mucosa. Ultrasonographic images are well correlated with contrast radiographic studies and gross morphological appearance. Ultrasound is a non-invasive, very useful diagnostic tool for detecting bladder polyps, but histopathology is required for definitive diagnosis.",0
2272,"A two-dimensional temperature estimation method was developed based on the detection of shifts in echo location of backscattered ultrasound from a region of tissue undergoing thermal therapy. The echo shifts are due to the combination of the local temperature dependence of speed of sound and thermal expansion in the heated region. A linear relationship between these shifts and the underlying tissue temperature rise is derived from first principles and experimentally validated. The echo shifts are estimated from the correlation of successive backscattered ultrasound frames, and the axial derivative of the accumulated echo shifts is shown to be proportional to the temperature rise. Sharp lateral gradients in the temperature distribution introduce ripple on the estimates of the echo shifts due to a thermo-acoustic lens effect. This ripple can be effectively reduced by filtering the echo shifts along the axial and lateral directions upon differentiation. However, this is achieved at the expense of spatial resolution. Experimental evaluation of the accuracy (0.5 degrees C) and spatial resolution (2 mm) of the algorithm in tissue mimicking phantoms was conducted using a diagnostic ultrasound imaging scanner and a therapeutic ultrasound unit. The estimated temperature maps were overlaid on the gray-scale ultrasound images to illustrate the applicability of this technique for image guidance of focused ultrasound thermal therapy.",0
2274,"These studies documented the presence or absence of macroscopic and microscopic intraparenchymal hemorrhage in individual lung lobes of mice, rabbits, and pigs exposed to continuous- and pulsed-wave (diagnostic) ultrasound; we described the character of and lesions associated with the hemorrhage and compared differences in the lesions among species and exposure conditions to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms and species differences associated with ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage. In a series of three sequential interdependent studies, 312 mice, 91 rabbits, and 74 pigs were divided at random into experimental groups and exposed to continuous-wave ultrasound (3 kHz modulated at 120 Hz) of acoustic pressure levels ranging from 0 to 490 kPa for 5, 10, or 20 minutes. In a fourth study, three mice, 43 rabbits, and six pigs were divided at random into experimental groups and exposed to pulsed-wave ultrasound (3- and 6-MHz center frequency) of peak rarefactional acoustic pressure levels ranging from 0 to 5.6 MPa for 5 minutes. Macroscopic lesions induced by continuous- and pulsed-wave ultrasound consisted of dark red to black areas of hemorrhage that extended from visceral pleural surfaces into lung parenchyma. Hemorrhage appeared spatially related to the edges of lung lobes where pleura of dorsal and ventral surfaces met, occurred in specific lung lobes in all three species, and appeared anatomically related to lung that was closest to and in contiguous alignment with the ultrasound transducer and thus the path of the sound beam. Macroscopic lesions were similar in all species under all exposure conditions for both continuous- and pulsed-wave ultrasound; however, hemorrhage was not induced in pig lung exposed to pulsed-wave ultrasound at any peak rarefactional acoustic pressure level. Eighteen mice (145 kPa exposure pressure), 60 rabbits (145-460 kPa exposure pressure), and 58 pigs (145-490 kPa exposure pressure) from study 3 were used for microscopic evaluation of lung exposed to continuous-wave ultrasound; three mice (6 MHz; 2.9 and 5.4 MPa), 39 rabbits (3 and 6 MHz; 2.3-5.4 MPa), and six pigs (3 and 6 MHz; 3.3, 5.4, and 5.6 MPa) from study 4 were used for microscopic evaluation of lung exposed to pulsed-wave ultrasound. Microscopic lesions and the character of hemorrhage induced by continuous-wave ultrasound were different from those induced by pulsed-wave ultrasound. Lesions induced by continuous-wave ultrasound under all exposure conditions were similar in all three species. Lesions induced by pulsed-wave ultrasound under all exposure conditions were similar in all three species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0
2276,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic consequences arising from abnormal ultrasound findings in a multidisciplinary setting in the University of Regensburg Clinical Centre. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The results of 1162 randomly selected ultrasound examinations (on 671 males and 491 females) from a total of 14,301 at an interdisciplinary ultrasound unit were analysed. The investigators recorded the findings in a routinely used standardized manner. The records and discharge reports of each patient were then evaluated with regard to the diagnostic and therapeutic consequences of the findings. RESULTS: There were 1843 abnormal findings in 901 patients. In 114 patients (6.2 %) no adequate diagnostic measures had been undertaken or recommended at discharge, but the reasons for the decisions taken could not be judged (value 4). 72.1 % of all patients were recruited from departments of internal medicine. However, the highest percentage of findings without adequate consequences were found to be in patients of the departments of oral and maxillofacial surgery, dermatology and nuclear medicine. CONCLUSION: The number of ultrasound examinations that had been done without adequate consequences was comparatively low at 6.2 %. But perhaps this number can be further reduced by improved wording of the examination reports.",0
2279,"AIM: To assess the impact of training two general practitioners (GPs), on performing low complexity ultrasound examinations of the abdomen with diagnostic competence. STUDY DESIGN: A non-randomised, prospective, double blind evaluation study of the acquired competence. Ultrasound examinations were performed successively and independently by the GP and the radiologist, and registered on two sheets of an identical case report form. SETTING: Departments of Vic General Hospital and Vic Health Care Centre of the Catalan Health Institute. SUBJECTS: A total of 120 patients who needed a low complexity abdominal ultrasound from a total amount of 868 ultrasound examinations scheduled. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: The kappa index of the primary diagnosis (ultrasound diagnostic conclusion), as well as of the ultrasound findings for each abdominal organ was calculated. A good level of training was considered if a minimum kappa index of 0.80 was attained between general practitioner and radiologist. RESULTS: After six month running, an ""ad interim"" analysis showed a kappa index for the primary ultrasound diagnosis of 0.85. At the end of the study, an overall kappa index of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.82-0.98) was achieved. The agreement by organs was also high (pancreas and spleen excluded), as well as sensitivity (>75%) and specificity (>90%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study demonstrate the feasibility of the performance, by trained GPs, of ultrasound examinations of low complexity of the abdomen with diagnostic competence.",0

2281,"Function analysis of rodent respiratory skeletal muscles, particularly the diaphragm, is commonly performed by isolating muscle strips using invasive surgical procedures. Although this is an effective method of assessing in vitro diaphragm activity, it involves non-survival surgery. The application of non-invasive ultrasound imaging as an in vivo procedure is beneficial since it not only reduces the number of animals sacrificed, but is also suitable for monitoring disease progression in live mice. Thus, our ultrasound imaging method may likely assist in the development of novel therapies that alleviate muscle injury induced by various respiratory diseases. Particularly, in clinical diagnoses of obstructive lung diseases, ultrasound imaging has the potential to be used in conjunction with other standard tests to detect the early onset of diaphragm muscle fatigue. In the current protocol, we describe how to accurately evaluate diaphragm contractility in a mouse model using a diagnostic ultrasound imaging technique.",0
2282,"This work attempts to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for acute cholecystitis in 98 clinically suspected patients from the emergency unit in whom at least 3 of 6 relevant criteria are present. Gallbladder distention to 5 cm or more transversely or in the anterior-posterior axis (criterion 1) was present in 64 patients; thickening of the gallbladder wall of at least 5 mm (criterion 2) in 95; cholelithiasis (criterion 3) in 86; sonolucent halo in the gallbladder wall (criterion 4) in 40; sonolucent fluid band surrounding the gallbladder (criterion 5) in 27; and intraluminal echogenic mass with no posterior acoustic shadow (criterion 6) in 35. A diagnostic accuracy index, corrected for chance, was statistically and clinically more relevant with 3 as the minimum number of criteria for the ultrasonic diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.",0
2283,"Ultrasound is most useful in detecting and characterizing peripheral and abdominal lymph nodes and infiltration of solid organs. B-mode criteria, such as size, shape, number, distribution architecture, echogenicity and delineation of margins are the basis for characterizing lymph nodes. Additionally color coding techniques such as color Doppler, B-flow and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) contribute to the evaluation of the nodal vasculature and vessel architecture. Whenever possible high frequency probes should not only be used for evaluating peripheral lymph nodes but also for lymphatic infiltration of solid organs, especially the spleen. The CEUS technique will be of additional benefit in detecting characterizing potential lymphatic organ infiltration. Ultrasound is an ideal tool for guided punctures, for which core biopsies should be preferred over fine needle aspiration biopsy and CEUS can also be used for proving residual viable tissue after chemotherapy or radiation therapy.",0
2286,"INTRODUCTION: This report presents the treatment of an aortic endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) device failure, focusing on the use of colour duplex ultrasound (CDUS) to diagnose and confirm effective treatment of a type IIIb endoleak. REPORT: An 89 year old man with a history of EVAR was transferred to the authors' centre with complaints of abdominal pain and a pressure sensation behind the umbilicus. A previously stable 11 cm aneurysm sac was visualised on computed tomography angiography in addition to a newly suspected type IIIb endoleak, which was confirmed via CDUS. He underwent successful endovascular repair with a stent across the limb defect. The patient was discharged uneventfully and was followed for surveillance. DISCUSSION: Type IIIb endoleak is an underreported complication after EVAR. CDUS of type IIIb endoleak aided in localisation and characterisation of the graft failure, and confirmed successful endovascular treatment of the endoleak defect in the side limb. Locating the point of graft failure using CDUS preceding endovascular repair of type IIIb endoleaks guides interventions and repair outcomes. It is a rare opportunity to report a case of acute type IIIb endoleak with CDUS that definitively localised an endograft defect.",0
2287,"Embedding of diagnostic and health care information requires secure encryption and watermarking. This research paper presents a comprehensive study for the behavior of some well established watermarking algorithms in frequency domain for the preservation of stroke-based diagnostic parameters. Two different sets of watermarking algorithms namely: two correlation-based (binary logo hiding) and two singular value decomposition (SVD)-based (gray logo hiding) watermarking algorithms are used for embedding ownership logo. The diagnostic parameters in atherosclerotic plaque ultrasound video are namely: (a) bulb identification and recognition which consists of identifying the bulb edge points in far and near carotid walls; (b) carotid bulb diameter; and (c) carotid lumen thickness all along the carotid artery. The tested data set consists of carotid atherosclerotic movies taken under IRB protocol from University of Indiana Hospital, USA-AtheroPoint™ (Roseville, CA, USA) joint pilot study. ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis was performed on the bulb detection process that showed an accuracy and sensitivity of 100 % each, respectively. The diagnostic preservation (DPsystem) for SVD-based approach was above 99 % with PSNR (Peak signal-to-noise ratio) above 41, ensuring the retention of diagnostic parameter devalorization as an effect of watermarking. Thus, the fully automated proposed system proved to be an efficient method for watermarking the atherosclerotic ultrasound video for stroke application.",0
2288,"The automated volume scanning system (AVSS) has been applied in breast diseases, but its use in incisional hernias has not been reported. In this study, conventional handheld B-mode ultrasound (HHUS) and AVSS examined a total of 122 hernia defects in 78 patients. The results from two modalities were then compared with surgical findings for the purpose of assessing the diagnostic value of AVSS. Statistics showed that surgeries identified 38 small, 23 medium and 17 large incisional hernias. The results of AVSS completely agreed with surgical findings; however, HHUS misidentified nine large hernias as medium and seven medium hernias as large. AVSS proved to be more accurate than HHUS in measuring the length and width of the hernia. It also outperformed HHUS in both detecting the incisional hernias (91.8% vs. 78.7%, p = 0.00) and determining hernia contents (89.3% vs. 68.0%, p = 0.00). Moreover, the coronal images AVSS obtained clearly displayed the shapes of the hernias, with 46 being regular and 32 irregular. Overall, AVSS can be used as a promising diagnostic modality for incisional hernias.",0
2289,"Echogenic liposomes (ELIP) are submicron-sized phospholipid vesicles that contain both gas and fluid. With antibody conjugation and drug incorporation, these liposomes can be used as novel targeted diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound contrast agents. The utility of liposomes for contrast depends upon their stability in an acoustic field, whereas the use of liposomes for drug delivery requires the liberation of encapsulated gas and drug payload at the desired treatment site. The objective of this study was twofold: (1) to characterize the stability of liposome echogenicity after reconstitution and (2) to quantitate the acoustic destruction thresholds of liposomes as a function of peak rarefactional pressure (P(r)), pulse duration (PD) and pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The liposomes were insonified in an anechoic sample chamber using a Philips HDI 5000 diagnostic ultrasound scanner with a L12-5 linear array. Liposome stability was evaluated with 6.9-MHz fundamental and 4.5-MHz harmonic B-mode pulses at various P(r) at a fixed PRF. Liposome destruction thresholds were determined using 6.0-MHz Doppler pulses, by varying the PD with a fixed PRF of 1.25 kHz and by varying the PRF with a fixed PD of 3.33 micros. Videos or freeze-captured images were acquired during each insonation experiment and analyzed for echogenicity in a fixed region of interest as a function of time. An initial increase in echogenicity was observed for fundamental and harmonic B-mode imaging pulses. The threshold for acoustically driven diffusion of gas out of the liposomes using 6.0-MHz Doppler pulses was weakly dependent upon PRF and PD. The rapid fragmentation thresholds, however, were highly dependent upon PRF and PD. The quantification of acoustic destruction thresholds of ELIP is an important first step in their development as diagnostic and drug delivery agents.",0
2290,"INTRODUCTION: Utilization of 20 MHz ultrasound probes provided application of ultrasound in dermatology-dermatosonography. As a diagnostic tool, ultrasound was first registered in the early fifties of the past century. Great progress of dermatosonography occurred in the mid-nineties with introduction of the first 20 MHz scanner. METHODS OF ULTRASONOGRAPHY IN DERMATOLOGY: Several methods of ultrasonography have been developed: method A, method B, scannibg C method and Doppler ultrasound. They were based on different acoustic features of various tissues. ULTRASOUND IN DIAGNOSTICS: Today, dermatosonography is used in diagnosing: cutaneous neoplasms, inflammatory skin diseases and skin diseases of unknown etiology. Apart from that, it is used in differentiating benign and malignant tumors and may be helpful in monitoring morphea, dermatomyositis, cutaneous sarcoidosis, erythema nodosum, allergic diseases, postthrombotic syndrome, physiologic aging and aging due to sun exposure. It can be used in noninvasive monitoring of local treatment, therapeutic responses and adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Dermatosonography offers valuable possibilities in assessing skin morphology at an intermediate level: between clinical assessment and microscopy.",0
2291,"Diagnostic ultrasound has an incredible impact in medicine, especially in obstetrics and gynecology practice. Due to wide clinical practice the knowledge about potential bioeffects in tissues are mandatory. Safety assurance for diagnostic ultrasound in obstetrics is interesting topic, there is a lack of proven harmful effects in fetuses. Technical developments in imaging suggest higher energy exposition levels. For this reason education and responsibility play important role in safety use of the ultrasound.",0
2294,"Hypotension is a common presentation in the emergency department. At times, the available history is limited, and the physical exam alone may be misleading. In these life-threatening situations, waiting for laboratory studies or formal imaging studies may not be feasible. Instead, using bedside ultrasound can quickly narrow the potential etiologies of the hypotension. Multiple ultrasound protocols have been proposed for the evaluation of the hypotensive patient. The commonly-used rapid ultrasound in shock (RUSH) exam will be reviewed here. This bedside protocol has been demonstrated to quickly and accurately determine the etiology of shock in the hands of an emergency medicine physician. The HI-MAP mnemonic describes the components of the RUSH protocol: heart, inferior vena cava (IVC), Morrison’s pouch (focused assessment with sonography for trauma [FAST] views with thoracic windows), aorta, pulmonary. This allows for a systematic approach to the exam. Others have also simplified the exam into the “pump, tanks, pipes” approach.",0
2295,"The clinical value of diagnostic ultrasound in the management of urologic patients is now firmly established. The use of real time diagnostic ultrasound equipment in the solo office practice of a urologist was evaluated by retrospective office record review covering a period of at least one year. The appropriate use of this equipment in daily office practice is shown to be clinically useful, cost-effective, and easily performed by a urologist. The routine use of diagnostic ultrasound by urologists is recommended.",0
2296,"BACKGROUND: Although endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the best modality in the diagnosis of gastric submucosal tumours (G-SMT), it is still invasive and expensive. We evaluated the usefulness of transabdominal ultrasonography (US) as an alternative to EUS in the assessment and clinical management of G-SMT. METHODS: This is a prospective study of 156 successive patients who had been diagnosed with G-SMT by direct endoscopic visualization. For each patient, US was performed prior to EUS by an examiner who had not been informed about the site or the size of the patient's G-SMT beforehand. US diagnoses were compared with those ascertained by EUS. Diagnostic grade by US was divided into three groups: diagnosed (G-SMT was clearly demonstrated including location, site and type), detected (G-SMT was demonstrable but the type was not clear) and undetected (G-SMT was not demonstrated by US). RESULTS: We found that US can be an alternative to EUS for: 1) diagnosis of extramural compression, 2) diagnosis of G-SMT with size >30 mm in diameter, 3) detection and measurement of the size of a G-SMT from 21 to 30 mm in diameter, and 4) detection and measurement of the size of a G-SMT at both the gastric angle and cardia, regardless of the size of the tumour. Overall sensitivity and specificity for the detection of G-SMT were 82.5% and 100%, respectively. The diagnostic rates of G-SMT in each group were 60.1% (86/143) for diagnosed, 22.4% (32/143) for detected and 17.5% (25/143) for undetected. Approximate 95% (21/22) of G-SMT over 20 mm in diameter were at least detected, and 97% (30/31) of G-SMT over 30 mm in diameter were diagnosed by US. CONCLUSION: US can be an alternative method in the assessment of G-SMT, especially in the follow-up of patients already diagnosed.",0
2297,"Ninety one patients with urinary tract abnormalities diagnosed before birth were reviewed. Diagnoses based on prenatal and postnatal ultrasound scans alone were compared with the final diagnoses after full urological investigations, with operative or necropsy confirmation in 79 cases. The results confirmed that ultrasound examination before birth usually detects nonspecific abnormalities and although scanning after birth is more accurate it is not absolutely reliable. A diagnosis of ""multicystic kidney' made on ultrasound scan alone is especially prone to error. Such mistakes can be avoided if full urological investigation is undertaken in every case.",0
2298,"An ultrasound contact imaging method is proposed to measure the enamel thickness in the human tooth. A delay-line transducer with a working frequency of 15 MHz is chosen to achieve a minimum resolvable distance of 400 μm in human enamel. To confirm the contact between the tooth and the transducer, a verification technique based on the phase shift upon reflection is used. Because of the high attenuation in human teeth, linear frequency-modulated chirp excitation and pulse compression are exploited to increase the penetration depth and improve the SNR. Preliminary measurements show that the enamel-dentin boundary creates numerous internal reflections, which cause the applied chirp signals to interfere arbitrarily. In this work, the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) is employed for the first time in dental imaging to separate chirp signals overlapping in both time and frequency domains. The overlapped chirps are compressed using the FrFT and matched filter techniques. Micro-computed tomography is used for validation of the ultrasound measurements for both techniques. For a human molar, the thickness of the enamel layer is measured with an average error of 5.5% after compressing with the FrFT and 13.4% after compressing with the matched filter based on the average speed of sound in human teeth.",0
2299,"Diagnostic ultrasound is helpful in the assessment of many common gynecological conditions from early teens to the late postmenopause. Female pelvic anatomy and pathology are readily imaged through a distended urinary bladder. In gynecologic cancer, examination of peritoneal cavity, kidneys and liver can suggest metastatic spread, which aids tumor staging.",0
2300,"Ultrasound (US) at diagnostic frequency and power is known to alter nerve potentials; however, the precise mechanism of action is unknown. We investigated whether US alters resting nerve potential to lower the threshold for magnetic nerve stimulation. Seventeen healthy subjects were recruited. For each subject, a 1.5 MHz US imaging probe was placed onto the elbow with the beam directed at the ulnar nerve. The probe was coupled to the skin using standard acoustic coupling gel as would be done for a routine clinical US scan. Ulnar nerve stimulation was performed simultaneously with magnetic stimulation (MS). Successful magnetic stimulation of the ulnar nerve was confirmed with nerve potentials measured by electromyography. There was no significant change in electromyography signal when MS was performed during US exposure. US at the diagnostic frequency and power tested does not alter nerve thresholds with MS. Testing at other frequencies is required, however, before US is negated as a technique to modify MS thresholds.",0
2301,"Sound waves progress through a medium at a velocity that is characteristic of that medium. In a particular medium, wavelength and frequency are inversely related, so that short wavelengths can only be obtained at higher frequencies. A beam of sound will not be directional unless the object that is sending (or reflecting) it is at least several times longer than the wavelength. In tissue directional beams of 1 cm or less in width can be produced at frequencies of 1 MHz or more. Other things being equal, the higher the frequency, the narrower the beam. The attenuation of beams of sound in tissue at ultrasonic frequencies is directly and almost linearly related to frequency in that the higher the frequency, the greater the attenuation and the weaker the return signals. In choosing an operating frequency for a particular purpose, one must therefore bear in mind that the advantages of the higher frequencies (i.e., better resolution, both in range and azimuth) are obtained at the bost of a shorter effective range. Accordingly, one makes the best compromise by selecting the highest frequency that permits a range adequate for the purpose. In scanning the abdomens of adults where the range may be fairly long, a 2 MHz transducer is used. For cardiac studies in pediatric patients where the range is shorter and the structures smaller, a 5 MHz probe can be used. In the globe of the eye the structures are minute, the medium one in which losses are quite low and the range is very short, permitting the use of frequencies in the 10 to 20 MHz range.",0
2302,Ultrasound examination has been recommended for the evaluation of acute haemorrhages into soft tissues or joints in haemophilic patients. We have reviewed the notes of all such patients admitted during one calendar year and find that in 47 separate admissions the ultrasound examination assisted management decisions on 27 occasions. The technique is described with an analysis of the ways in which ultrasound observations may influence the clinician.,0
2307,It is a common assumption that the human skull and solid skull implants are impermeable to diagnostic ultrasound. We demonstrated in 2 patients that frontoparietal polyetheretherketone cranioplasties allowed useful imaging of intracranial parenchymal and vascular structures with higher ultrasound frequencies than the 2 MHz used for the temporal bone window. This knowledge about additional imaging properties may be helpful in emergency situations and for vascular monitoring. The decision for a polyether ether ketone cranioplasty may contribute to patient safety.,0
2308,"INTRODUCTION: The word artifact stands for any visible result of imaging procedures which is caused by the procedure itself and not the entity being analyzed. Recognition of artifacts in everyday work is of great significance for final diagnosis, since their wrong interpretation not only compromises the value of ultrasound finding, but may also lead to a wrong therapeutic approach. ULTRASOUND ARTIFACTS: Artifacts appear as the result of physical properties of an ultrasound beam, technical aspects of ultrasound apparatus and immobility in creation of ultrasound image. Artifacts in the form of acoustic shadows, acoustic enhancements and reverberation most commonly appear and lead to changed appearance of certain structures. That is why great experience and knowledge of radiologists-ultrasonographists is necessary, since diagnostic accuracy of the method itself is under their immediate control. Incorrect interpretation of artifacts and failure to recognize them reduces the value of ultrasound imaging which has, during the past 25 years, confirmed its exceptional diagnostic value.",0
2310,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe the technique of dynamic ultrasound (US) examination of the triquetral clunk, and to illustrate the range of findings in four patients with midcarpal instability (MCI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients were identified (3 men, 1 woman). The case notes, plain radiographs, MRI and dynamic US for each patient were reviewed. Digital video files recording the dynamic US of the triquetral clunks were analysed for the following features of abnormal triquetral mobility: direction and speed of triquetral snap, amount of anteroposterior translocation, and flexion or extension during the snap. RESULTS: Five different triquetral clunks were recorded in 4 patients. In four out of five cases the clunk occurred during ulnar translocation of the wrist, and in one during radial translocation. Anteroposterior translocation was anterior (3.4 - 4.7 mm) in three of the clunks and posterior (1 - 10 mm) in two. The degree of flexion or extension varied between 1 and 16 degrees . The snapping phase of the clunk lasted between 0.17 and 0.25 seconds. CONCLUSION: Dynamic US can be used to confirm the diagnosis of midcarpal instability by identifying a triquetral catch-up clunk. Quantification of carpal mobility with US may lead to further insights into the mechanics of MCI.",0
2311,"Paraovarian cysts are a rare pathology, constituting 10-20% of the adnexal masses. The origin can be represented by paramesonephric ducts (Hydatid cysts of Morgagni), vestiges of mesonephric ducts also represented by mesothelium, or neoplastic (cystadenomas or cystadenofibromas) that are mostly benign. Borderline or malignant paraovarian tumors are encountered less often. This article presents a case of paraovarian cyst in a 37-year-old patient, with a history of 2 pregnancies, completed by cesarean. The patient sought medical attention for an asymptomatic voluminous ovarian cyst, detected in a routine ultrasound scan. Laboratory tests and tumor markers were within normal limits. Transvaginal ultrasound and color Doppler revealed a cystic adnexal mass with 10 cm transonic, smooth, homogeneous content, avascular walls with no internal papillary projections, with a ""hyperechoic line"" sign of delimitation from the ovarian capsule, mostly visible when the adnexa was mobilized. The diagnostic and curative laparoscopic surgery was successful, followed by a quick recovery. The histopathological exam confirmed the benignity and the origin of the paraovarian cyst. The case was discussed in the context of the literature review concerning this pathology, drawing attention to the real possibility of differentiating ovarian from paraovarian cysts by ultrasound.",0
2312,"Biological effects induced by ultrasound were frequently reported for continuous wave (cw) mode. Thresholds for the onset of bioeffects of pulsed ultrasound, starting from diagnostic conditions, have not yet been defined by standardized in vitro models. We therefore investigated the effects of pulsed ultrasound on cultured cells using diagnostic ultrasound devices, a selfmade transducer and a sonochemical laboratory reactor tunable from pulsed diagnostic conditions to cw ultrasound. Additionally, we determined physical parameters of the ultrasonic field by different types of hydrophones. Sonochemical reactions and the effects induced by the ultrasonic fields in cultured cells indicated a threshold for bioeffects.",0
2313,"OBJECTIVES: Although prenatal ultrasound is broadly used to detect abnormal fetuses, the variability in the interpretation of second-trimester prenatal ultrasound examinations is unknown. We sought to evaluate the consistency of the interpretation of prenatal ultrasound examinations. DESIGN: Physicians who perform prenatal ultrasound and who participate in the California Maternal Serum Expanded AFP program were asked to interpret a series of test ultrasound examinations. The series of cases was selected to include a random sample of fetal structural abnormalities, ultrasound markers that have been associated with chromosomal abnormalities, and normal cases. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using a kappa statistic for each organ system. The sensitivity and false-positive rate were calculated for detecting specific anatomic abnormalities within each organ system. RESULTS: Of the 210 sonologists eligible for inclusion in the study, completed responses were received from 148 (70%). There was moderate to substantial agreement between physicians in reporting the presence of fetal abnormalities for all organ systems (kappa range 0.40-0.88, P < 0.001). The consistency was highest for the central nervous system (CNS), neck, and face. Within each organ system, the consistency was similar for major structural abnormalities and ultrasound markers of chromosomal abnormalities. The sensitivity ranged from 62% (95% confidence interval (CI) 58-66%) for major renal abnormalities to 91% (95% CI 88-94%) for CNS abnormalities, with corresponding false-positive rates of 7% (95% CI 6-9%) for renal abnormalities and 9% (95% CI 7-11%) for CNS abnormalities. For most organ systems, the sensitivity for detecting ultrasound markers of chromosomal abnormalities was similar to the sensitivity for detecting structural abnormalities. CONCLUSION: There is moderate to substantial agreement in the interpretation of second-trimester prenatal ultrasound examinations. Whether the identification of specific ultrasound abnormalities and markers is overall beneficial to patients remains to be determined.",0
2314,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the characteristic features of musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) in gouty arthritis (GA) and to assess its value in GA diagnosis. METHODS: Patients with GA and non-GA who underwent MSUS examination in Chinese PLA General Hospital were enrolled in this study. The synovitis, tenosynovitis, soft tissue swelling, bone erosion, bursitis and ossification were measured by grey-scale ultrasound, and the synovial vascularity was measured by power Doppler ultrasound to evaluate the degree of inflammation. RESULTS: The ultrasound images of GA were intended to have specific features like tophus, hyperechoic deposition on the surface of the articular hyaline cartilage (double contour sign), hyperechoic deposition in the synovium appearing as bright stippled foci, and bright strap in tendons with a significant difference when compared with non-GA group (P < 0.05). The percentage of tenosynovitis and bone erosion in non-GA group was higher than that in the GA group with a significant difference (P < 0.05). Tophus, double contour sign, bright stippled foci or bright stippled foci in tendons together suggested gout with a specificity of 92.4% and a sensitivity of 60.3%, the AUC of ROC was 0.764 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Tophus, double contour sign, bright foci and bright strap detected by MSUS are of diagnostic value on GA and MSUS may be a promising tool in diagnosing GA.",0
2315,"The exemplary safety record of diagnostic ultrasound (DUS) is probably an important reason that it has become so widely used. Advances in technology and procedures promise to make it even more valuable. At the same time, some of these advances bring with them new situations where harm can occur unless they are given appropriate attention. Maintaining patient safety along with increasing benefits requires (1) a vigorous continuing research program for determining optimum operating conditions and (2) effective means for communicating guidance to users. In this article, a standard developed in the USA for displaying safety information is discussed.",0
2322,"Diagnostic ultrasound was used in 103 patients with a clinically suspected fracture of the scaphoid bone in order to achieve an early diagnosis. There were 48 women and 55 men aged 10-75 years (mean 31.4 years) tested with ultrasound. Of the patients, 72 were tested within 3 days after injury the remainder between 4 and 42 days. Fracture was confirmed radiologically in 27. We found that the ultrasound test, applied with a frequency of 1 MHz and intensity of 0.5 W/cm2 and 2.0 W/cm2 for 30s, had a sensitivity of 37 per cent and a specificity of 61 per cent. We thus conclude that ultrasound is not suitable for early diagnosis of scaphoid fracture.",0
2323,"We describe a noninvasive quantitative way of measuring muscle with a specially-designed digital ultrasound scanner. Reliability and reproducibility of echo amplitude were determined in 16 normal male volunteers--10 runners and 6 non-runners. Echo amplitudes were recorded from the quadriceps femoris muscle. The muscle was scanned at mid-thigh in a relaxed state with 18 degrees flexion and in an isometrically contracted state with the leg in full extension. Echo amplitudes obtained in the non-runner group were: (1) mean value of the muscle in the relaxed state (174.9 +/- 30.8) and (2) mean value of the muscle in the contracted state (121.8 +/- 31.4). The difference in these values (53.1) was significant at p less than 0.05. Echo amplitudes for runners were: (1) mean value of the muscle in the relaxed state (146.6 +/- 39.2) and (2) mean value of the muscle in the contracted state (107.1 +/- 30.1). The difference in these values (39.5) was significant at p less than -0.01. The data indicate that: values of echo amplitudes are reproducible; there is a statistically significant difference in the mean amplitudes of muscle in a contracted and relaxed state; and while the difference between runner and non-runner muscle is not statistically significant (p greater than 0.1), there is a trend toward significance. Because ultrasound amplitude is a function of tissue structure, this technique may provide a noninvasive method for quantifying muscle collagen and fat.",0

2328,"The usefulness of diagnostic ultrasound in gene transfer was investigated. The hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines PRL/PRF/5 and Hep3B, and the pancreatic carcinoma Panc-1 cells were transfected with lipofectin or irradiated with a linear probe with a frequency of 8 MHz at a mechanical index of 0.4 through the bottom of the plates for 5 min using diagnostic ultrasound (US) with pEGFP-N1 [green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression plasmid], and observed under fluorescence microscopy 48 h later. The cell lines were transfected or irradiated with US with pGL3 control (luciferase reporter plasmid), and a luciferase assay (48 h later) or an MTS assay (72 h later) were performed. Although signals of GFP were observed in cells with US, the transfection efficiencies of US were lower than those of transfection. Luciferase activities of cells with US were higher than those of non-irradiated or transfected cells, but lower than those of transfection. Cell viability with US did not change.",0
2329,"The modulation of cellular endothelial permeability is a desirable goal for targeted delivery of labels and therapeutic macromolecules; the underlying mechanisms, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesize that a higher endothelial permeability may result as an outcome of selective enhancement of caveolar endocytosis by ultrasound (US), in the frequency and intensity range of current clinical diagnostic use. To assess the role of free radicals in this phenomenon, we exposed confluent human endothelial cells to pulsed diagnostic US for 30 min, with a mechanical index (MI) of 0.5 and 1.2, using a 1.6-MHz cardiac US scan, and endothelial cells not exposed to US were used as control. Here we show that pulsed diagnostic US with a MI of 1.2 (high mechanical index ultrasound [HMIUS]) were able to selectively enhance endothelial caveolar internalization of recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-Tat11-EGFP fusion protein (26 +/- 1 vs. 11.6 +/- 1 A.U, p < 0.001 vs. control), without disruption of plasma membrane integrity. Moreover, pulsed diagnostic US with a MI of 0.5 (low mechanical index ultrasound) did not increase caveolar endocytosis compared with control (11.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 11.6 +/- 1). Free-radical generation inhibitors, such as catalase and superoxide dismutase, reduced the HMIUS-induced caveolar internalization by a 49.29% factor; finally, HMIUS-induced caveolar endocytosis was found to be associated with a significant increase in the phosphorylation of tyr-14-caveolin1, ser1177-eNOS and Thr202/Tyr204-ERK(1/2) compared with control. These findings show how HMIUS irradiation of human endothelial cells cause a selective enhancement of caveolar-dependent permeability, partially mediated by free radicals generation, inducing a marked increase of phosphorylation of caveolar-related proteins. Thus, the use of diagnostic US could potentially be used as an adjuvant to drive caveolar traffic of extracellular peptides by using a higher level of US energy.",0
2331,"This article is meant to serve as a simple introduction to diagnostic ultrasound, explaining the nature of sonar and the basic equipment for its production and use. A scans, B scans, time-position scans, and Doppler-shift techniques are described, with some examples of the clinical applications of each. Some recent innovations such as scan conversion to improve gray scaling and electrocardiographically triggered cardiac sector scans are mentioned. The limitations of the technique are indicated, with measures that can be adopted to reduce them. The safety of the procedure is emphasized, with its freedom from the known biological effects of ionizing radiation.",0
2332,"Pancreatic cystic lymphangiomas are rare benign lesions that arise from lymphatic vessels, accounting for less than 0.2% of all pancreatic cysts. Typically it is asymptomatic and discovery occurs during imaging exams for non-pancreatic disease. In the past, a definite diagnosis was made through surgery, with complete resection of all tumoral tissue to prevent recurrence. Nowadays, the development of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) made it possible to identify these cysts combining morphologic ultrasound features, macroscopic aspirated fluid appearance, biochemical and cytological evaluation of the sample. We report two cases of cystic pancreatic lymphangioma diagnosed through EUS, allowing conservative management without surgery. These cases show that cystic pancreatic lymphangioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic pancreatic lesions and that EUS is an important tool for their recognition.",0
2333,"Some of the methods, calculations, and problems associated with making hydrophone measurements in diagnostic ultrasound fields are considered. Several organizations have proposed definitions of various peak and average intensities that need to be specified when characterizing medical ultrasound fields. All of these can be determined from hydrophone measurements, but the bandwidths encountered (>50 MHz), along with the small focal diameters achievable ( approximately 1 mm), can place great demands on hydrophone performance. Two general types of hydrophones are available-the spot-poled membrane and needle types. Both employ the piezopolymer polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF), and for the most part they have effective dimensions in the 0.5-1.0-mm range. Hydrophones can be made with useful bandwidths extending beyond 50 MHz. However, above approximately 15 MHz the nature of the response becomes highly dependent on the method of construction and PVDF film thickness used, as well as the characteristics of any associated preamplifier circuitry.

Stimulation is defined mainly as increased fetal gross body movements in response to excitation. METHODS: Fetuses of a group of 9 volunteer women (mean gestational age, 33.37 weeks; range, 25-40 weeks) were evaluated for body movement under 3 different conditions: (1) control, with no ultrasound exposure; (2) ultrasound in continuous wave Doppler mode; and (3) pulsed ultrasound in pulsed Doppler and B modes. A conventional external fetal monitor, with negligible ultrasonic output, was used to monitor fetal gross body motions. After an initial rest period of 3 minutes with 1 or no fetal motion, fetuses were monitored for an additional 3 minutes under the exposure criterion defined for each condition. Resulting fetal motions under the 3 conditions were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: The test showed that fetuses moved significantly more frequently under condition 3 (mean +/- SD, 3.43 +/- 1.93 movements per minute) than under condition 1 (0.40 +/- 7.33 movements per minute) or condition 2 (0.63 +/- 7.67 movements per minute); P = .004 and .016, respectively. Fetal movements under conditions 1 and 2 did not differ significantly. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic ultrasound may stimulate fetal body motion.",0
2335,"OBJECTIVE: To establish the usefulness of specific ultrasound (US) features as indications for ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in incidentally found infracentimetric thyroid nodules. METHODS: The ultrasonographic features and cytology of FNAB samples of 96 histopathologically-proven papillary microcarcinomas (less than 1 cm in long diameter) and 75 less than 1 cm sized benign nodules were analyzed and compared. The risk of malignancy indicated by each US feature was calculated by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the US features examined, internal content, shape, margin, echogenicity, and calcifications showed statistically significant differences between benign and malignant infracentimetric nodules. Crude odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk of malignancy were, for solid content, OR = 39.3 (95% CI = 3.3-4.64); for taller than wide shape, OR = 14.2 (95% CI = 1.43-14.1); for hypoechogenicity, OR = 3.57 (95% CI = 1.31-9.86); for marked hypoechogenicity, OR = 31.33 (95% CI = 6.63-14.8); and for coarse macrocalcifications, OR = 3.43 (95% CI = 1.04-11.3). CONCLUSIONS: Infracentimetric nodules that are solid, taller than wide, hypoechogenic or markedly hypoechogenic, and have coarse microcalcifications and macrocalcifications have a high risk of malignancy, indicating further assessment.",0
2337,"The induction of pulmonary hemorrhage by pulsed ultrasound was discovered over 20 years ago. This phenomenon may pose a risk of patient lung injury, particularly for point of care pulmonary ultrasound. A diagnostic ultrasound machine (HDI 5000; Philips Healthcare, Andover MA USA) with 7.6 MHz (CL15-7) linear array was used to image the right lung of anesthetized rats in a warmed water bath. The image showed rapid initiation and progression of comet tail artifacts across the lung image for an on-screen mechanical index (MI) of 0.9, which corresponded to a pulmonary hemorrhage in the lung. Groups of rats were scanned at a range of MI settings and a threshold was located at an MI of about 0.44. This finding indicated a greater sensitivity to pulmonary ultrasound than was expected, based on previous results. Further research is needed to understand this phenomenon and to develop safety guidelines for sonographers.",0
2338,"Neonatal rats 3 to 5 days of age were exposed to the ultrasound beam from a medical ultrasound imaging system. Dorsal nerve roots were examined by electron microscopy. Comparison between exposed and sham-exposed controls revealed disruption of the nodes of Ranvier attributable to ultrasound. Morphologic changes ranged from vacuole formation in the paranodal region to frank demyelination and were still evident after 24 h of recovery. Rats of this age are at a stage of myelination similar to that of a human fetus 4 to 5 months. The ultrasound intensities used in this study are consistent with those used for human imaging (SPTA 0.135 mW/cm2, SATA 0.045 mW/cm2, SPTP 8.7 W/cm2, SPPA 1.9 W/cm2), but the relevance of these findings to clinical ultrasound will require further study.",0
2339,"The psychological impact of ultrasound scanning in pregnancy was examined in low- and high-risk pregnancies. Women in each category were assigned consecutively to a condition of either low or high feedback. In the latter condition, the women received extensive verbal and visual feedback, whereas in the former, subjects were denied visual access to the monitor. Psychological changes were measured using the State Anxiety Inventory and the Subjective Stress Scale. When a male partner attended, he was included in the assessment. The emotional impact of ultrasound was influenced by the level of feedback provided, with those in the high-feedback condition indicating significantly less anxiety and more positive emotional experiences during the scan, compared with those who received less feedback.",0
2340,"A study was carried out to determine the effect of wound and fixation dressings on diagnostic ultrasound imaging. Each dressing was scanned with four ultrasound probes at two focal depth settings and the results were independently rated by five observers on a scale of 0-5. Data were analysed using the Chi-squared test and Pearson's correlation coefficient for inter-observer rating. The effect of the dressings was found to be independent of focal depth. Three probes produced similar results while the C7-4 curved array probe produced images affected by the dressings to a significantly greater extent. The total score for each dressing allows ranking according to lucency and demonstrates that hydrogel, thin film, and tulle gras dressings have the smallest effect on diagnostic ultrasound images, whereas dressings which are dense or contain air allow poor ultrasound penetration. It is suggested that, where diagnostic ultrasound is likely to be required in patients with wounds, traditional gauze-and-tape dressings should be avoided wherever possible as modern alternatives are available which meet the requirements of the wound while allowing the ultrasound system to produce a useful image.",0
2341,"Ultrasonography of the hip has gained wide acceptance as reliable method for diagnosing developmental hip dysplasia in infants. This blinded study was conducted to investigate the influence of two linear probes with different frequency on diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility. In 206 consecutive newborns, the bony roof angle (α-angle) and cartilage roof angle (β-angle) were assessed by three investigators according to Graf. The hips were measured twice both with a 7.5 MHz and a 12 MHz linear transducer (Sonoline G60S(®) ultrasound system; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Each investigator evaluated his sonograms 6 weeks later. Depending on the mean values for α-angle and β-angle, the hips were classified. Reproducibility of the Graf classification was not found to be influenced. In two of three investigators, we observed significant improvement concerning variation of the β-angle with the 12 MHz probe. The use of high-resolution transmitters may improve diagnostic accuracy in ultrasonography of the newborn's hip.",0
2342,"Surface temperatures of a variety of transducers used with common commercial ultrasonic diagnostic equipment have been measured. Transducers operating in imaging mode, in both continuous and pulsed Doppler modes, and in mixed modes were investigated. A total of 30 transducers and scan-heads used with equipment from 10 manufacturers were examined, including a range of array types, mechanical sectors and continuous-wave Doppler transducers. Measurements were made using an infrared radiometer, or a thermocouple probe, with the transducers operating in air. Surface temperatures of 13 transducers operating in imaging mode were found to be in the range 0.0-13.1 degrees C above ambient after 5 min operation. Some transducers operating in pulsed Doppler mode reached considerably higher temperatures. The most extreme example increased the surface temperature by 36.5 degrees C after 1 min and reached a steady-state temperature of almost 80 degrees C. Transducers operating at these temperatures cannot be retained on the skin of a conscious subject without pain, and will cause skin burns within a brief period of time. A linear relationship has been demonstrated between temperature increase and spatial-average acoustic intensity. The rate of increase in air was found to be about 10 times greater for pulsed arrays than for continuous-wave Doppler transducers.",0
2343,"Practically all widely used and safe and reversible methods of contraception exert a direct (or at least an indirect) impact on the endometrium. Not surprisingly, abnormal uterine bleeding is a frequent adverse reaction associated with contraception. In this situation sonography--in particular transvaginal sonography--offers the physician a practically non-invasive imaging technique for determining the etiology of abnormal uterine, cervical or vaginal bleeding. Ultrasonographic imaging provides the physician with a detailed picture of the internal reproductive organs. It can also be used to monitor the efficacy of the particular contraceptive method. e.g. to check the position of IUDs, confirm the suppression of ovarian follicle activity in women taking ovulation inhibitors, detect ovarian cysts as a focus of undesirable hormonal activity, etc. In some cases, the failure of contraception, namely pregnancy, can be diagnosed by ultrasound. By using high-frequency linear ultrasonographic probes, the physician can verify the position of subcutaneous contraceptive implants on the medial upper arm. Therapeutic consequences can be derived, in particular, from the ultrasonographic measurement of the total thickness of the endometrial layer.",0
2345,"Diagnostic ultrasound of the locomotor system is indispensable in modern orthopedic diagnostic practice. Due to its harmlessness, spatial display and identification of all structures, diagnostic ultrasound has significantly improved diagnostic procedures and has become a method of choice in a number of pathologic processes. Ultrasound enables visualization of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, tendons, hematomas, abscesses, cysts, bursae of joints, to a certain extent even bones, and the processes taking place in them and how they are related to the surrounding structures. Ultrasound also enables visualization of structures and processes that could not be clearly identified before, thus making its significance in orthopedics equal to its importance in other medical specialties.",0
2346,"This brief review addresses the issue of health and safety from exposure to diagnostic ultrasound. The exemplary historical record of diagnostic ultrasound exposures is coupled with great patient benefit. However, the power outputs of clinical devices have been increasing over the past decade such that inertial cavitation seems reasonably likely to occur if appropriate gas nuclei are present. The use of microbubble contrast agents for certain diagnostic procedures ensures a well nucleated system. Under such conditions, the use of low signal output levels and short exam times will decrease the chance of cavitation related bioeffects.",0
2348,"Diagnostic ultrasound has been used over the last eight years for the demonstration of various space-occupying lesions of the urogenital tract, for the estimation of the prostate size and for the identification of intrascrotal processes and tumours. 918 patients were studied by this method. In 595 (87.3 per cent) of the 682 surgical cases in this series ultrasonic diagnosis was confirmed by the surgical finding. False-positive and false-negative results totalled 17.7 per cent. The method is particularly suited for the differential diagnosis of renal cysts from tumours without the need for other procedures involving discomfort to the patients. This procedure, which is free from any iatrogenic hazard, provides accurate information on the size and structure of space-occupying lesions.",0
2350,"Capabilities of ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) as a diagnostic method for surgical planning and outcome analysis in nonstandard situations in phaco surgery have been investigated. The study enrolled 270 patients (278 eyes) with pseudophakia and 26 patients (33 eyes) with aphakia. The scanning was done on OTI HF 35-50 Ultrasound System biomicroscope (UBM) - OTI, Canada. An original method of intraocular lens (IOL) position evaluation by means of UBM, providing precise information on relative position of the IOL and ocular axes, planes, and anatomical structures, has been developed. The proposed technique has been applied to determine both whether the position of the IOL is correct (46 eyes) and, if not, which of three types of its dislocation is present (232 eyes). Clinical and functional features of each of the dislocation types have been analyzed. Detailed analysis of UBM scans of 47 patients (47 eyes) showed that secondary glaucoma development was triggered by loss of proper endocapsular fixation of the IOL with consequent traumatic contact between IOL haptics and uveal tract. This contact, on the one hand, leads to excessive wash-out of pigment and obstruction of outflow routes. On the other hand, it causes subacute reactive uveitis which aggravates preexisting ocular hypertension and glaucoma course. It has been demonstrated that UBM performed prior to IOL implantation enables adequate assessment of the implant bed, accounting for lens capsule integrity, ciliary sulcus configuration and parameters, as well as the extent of structural changes in the globe, which may result from trauma, uveitis or improper evacuation of lens matter during cataract removal. Authors recommend to include UBM into assessment of aphakic patients planned for secondary IOL implantation and to decide on IOL model and its fixation type depending on the UBM results.",0
2352,"The Routine Antenatal Diagnostic Imaging With Ultrasound Study (RADIUS) has reported that the adoption of routine screening in the United States would add considerably to health care costs, but stated that a potential benefit may be identification of fetal anomalies. To determine whether the cost per detected malformed fetus using data from the RADIUS study is cost-effective, a comparison is made with the California maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening program. When screening ultrasound is performed by individuals who have a diagnostic rate similar to that reported for tertiary centers that participated in the RADIUS study (6.8 per 1000), the cost for identifying a malformed fetus is $10,805 less ($200 per ultrasound examination) than the cost using MSAFP screening ($40,338; $53 per test). However, when the screening examination is performed by individuals whose diagnostic rate is similar to that reported for non-tertiary centers (1.7 per 1000) that participated in the RADIUS study, the cost for identifying a malformed fetus ($115,575) is $75,237 higher than MSAFP screening. Using data from the RADIUS study, a proposal is suggested by which physicians are reimbursed for second-trimester ultrasound based upon their diagnostic skills. This approach maintains the cost per detected malformed fetus at less than $30,000, decreases the current cost of diagnostic ultrasound to third-party payers, and allows second-trimester ultrasound to be offered as a cost-effective screening test for low-risk patients for identification of malformed fetuses.",0
2354,"The high flow priapism (HFP) is a very rare pathology. It must be distinguished from the low flow which is a real urologic emergency. The diagnosis of HFP (most often post-trauma) remains clinical, but penile color Doppler ultrasound can confirm, identify and track the evolution of the lesion. Conservative treatment is effective and remains the first line treatment. However the different therapeutic modalities (selective embolisation, surgery) should be explained to the patient and be considered case by case.",0
2355,"Fluid in the pleural cavity, parenchyma masses and consolidation provide excellent sonographic windows for scanning. Ultrasound has proven extremely useful in directing interventional procedures in the pleural space, pulmonary parenchyma and mediastinum. Ultrasound offers a number of advantages over other imaging methods, the most important being the capability to monitor continuously the interventional procedures, thus assuring maximum safety and benefit. We will discuss the indications, technique, performances and complications of ultrasound guided thoracic puncture in the pleural space, pulmonary parenchyma and mediastinum.",0
2357,"Biological effects from experimental ultrasound studies, such as chromosome aberrations and retardation of growth, have been recorded but mostly at levels far in excess of diagnostic intensity. The data surveyed in this review suggest that there is apparently little or no danger associated with diagnostic ultrasound exposure at clinical levels.",0
2358,"The generation of ultrasound (US) bioeffects using a clinical imaging system is controversial. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of microbubbles in the US field of a medical imager induces biologic effects. Both kidneys of anesthetized rats were insonified for 5 min using a medical imaging system after the administration of microbubbles. One kidney was insonified using a continuous mode (30 Hz) and the opposite kidney was insonified using an intermittent (1 Hz) technique. The microbubbles were exposed to three different transducer frequencies and four transducer output powers. After insonification, the animals were euthanized, the kidneys were removed and their gross appearance scored under ""blinded"" conditions using a defined scale. After the administration of microbubbles, US imaging of the kidney caused hemorrhage in the renal tissue. The severity and area of hemorrhage increased with an increase in the transducer power and a decrease in the transducer frequency. Intermittent insonification in the presence of microbubbles produced a greater degree of renal hemorrhage than continuous imaging techniques.",0
2363,"Preliminary results are presented of ultrasound investigations in 34 patients with suspected abdominal hernias. All patients were explored surgically on the basis of clinical indications, and the surgical findings were compared with the results of the ultrasound investigation. Small hernias in the anterior abdominal wall (fascia Spigelii and linea alba) can be demonstrated by ultrasound, but there are certain circumstances which can lead to false positive ultrasound results.",0
2365,"New technical developments in diagnostic ultrasound have won many converts to this modality. Once plagued with a reputation for producing blotchy black and white images, ultrasound today uses intracavitary probes and moving pictures with brilliant color to provide accurate, finely detailed images that are widely accepted in the fields of cardiology, vascular surgery, abdominal surgery, obstetrics, and gynecology.",0
2369,"It is now generally accepted that diagnostic ultrasound may have a role in Medicine, independently of the technological level of a society, as well as of the geographical factors of influence on its pathology. This means that many countries require ultrasound equipment of low cost and a decision must be made as to what kind of ultrasound facilities to set up and how: a central ultrasound unit for general application or different specialized services in several hospital departments. Alternatively, it is suggested a combined action of the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology, the ultrasound departments of highly developed countries, dealers and medical institutions of limited resources for the setting up of an ultrasound unit. This should be preceded by previous scientific training of medical staff of those institutions on the main diagnostic ultrasound applications, a survey of the potential users, a selection of the staff for the new service and continuous information. An outline of a proposal for that program is presented.",0
2374,"Our objective was to evaluate kidney antioxidant status in rats subjected to an ultrasound examination. Thirty rats were divided into five groups for injection of saline (S) or anesthetic (A), and application of ultrasound using different modes, B mode, pulsed wave Doppler, and continuous wave Doppler, under anesthesia. Ultrasound was performed on days 1, 3, and 5 relative to the initiation of the experiment. Rats were then scarified on day 6. The kidney tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured. Both TBARS level and SOD activity increased, 21% and 38%, respectively, due to anesthesia (P < 0.04 for both). SOD activity increased further by a factor of 1.2 in response to ultrasound examination (P < 0.05), whereas TBARS level was not affected by Doppler and continuous wave Doppler compared to anesthesia. Increases in the level of TBARS (P < 0.03) and SOD activity (P < 0.01) were greatest when B-mode ultrasound was employed. These substances did not increase further when continuous wave Doppler was employed. The peak-negative acoustic pressure (9.16 vs. 9.74 MPa) and frequency (3.57 vs. 6.95 MHz) for B mode and pulsed wave Doppler were greater than those for continuous wave Doppler (0.22 MPa and 1.96 MHz). The estimated mechanical indexes were 4.87, 3.70, and 0.15 for B mode, pulsed wave Doppler, and continuous wave Doppler, respectively. In conclusion, anesthesia may cause tissue damage as reflected by elevated lipid peroxidation and free radical formation and ultrasound examination may amplify tissue damage through mechanical effects caused by ultrasound absorption.",0
2376,"Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is a new technique that can be used for the diagnostic imaging of central pulmonary thromboembolism (PE). In eight cases at our clinic, EBUS was used because of mediastinal lymphadenopathies or paramediastinal nodular lesions and at the same time images were obtained of a PE by means of EBUS. The PE was diagnosed before the EBUS with computed tomography (CT) of the lungs in all cases (5 women and 3 men). The repletion defects of all the cases compatible with a PE were clarified with CT-angiography. EBUS may be an alternative method for the diagnosis of PE, as it can indicate the presence of a thrombus in the central pulmonary arteries in hemodynamically-stable cases.",0
2377,"Eighty cases of hepatic hemangioma were studied using ultrasound. In one group consisting of 28 subjects a final diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma was supported by arteriography (21 cases) or surgery (7 cases). In the remaining 52 cases, the diagnosis was uncertain and the normal clinical and biochemical findings with the ultrasound follow-up studies at intervals of 3, 6 and 12 months, made a diagnosis of hemangioma highly probable. Twenty-nine cases (9 cases of the first group and 20 of the second) were also evaluated by Tc-99m colloid and in vivo Tc-99m-labelled red blood cell scintigraphy. On the basis of ultrasound appearance and internal structure, hemangiomas may be divided into three groups: hyperechoic pattern (of which there were 16 cases in our study), cystic or anechoic pattern (5 cases), and complex pattern (7 cases). Fifty-two cases of uncertain diagnosis showed hyperechoic focal lesions with rounded, well-defined margins and no clinical or biological abnormalities. Differentiation from malignant forms must be approached according to the specific ultrasound pattern observed and the presence or absence of symptoms. Only in cases of hyperechoic, well-defined lesions detected in asymptomatic patients may a reliable diagnosis of hemangioma be made. The use of in vivo Tc-99m-labeled red blood cell scintigraphy (Tc-99m RBC scintigraphy) is useful in hyperechoic and cystic forms having a diameter greater than 3 cm. Complex forms invariably require additional studies, using complementary procedures (angiography, angio-CT) to confirm diagnosis.",0
2378,"Ultrasound technology has steadily advanced in the past decade, and has established itself as a useful diagnostic tool.

There is no apparent difference between the average weights of the infants subjected to diagnostic ultrasound and those who were not.",0
2380,"Placental localization by diagnostic ultrasound was performed at 16 to 18 weeks' gestation in 1,098 patients prior to amniocentesis for genetic indications. Placenta previa was diagnosed in 58 patients, 47 of whom went on to delivery uncomplicated by placenta previa. There were five patients with placenta previa at delivery, four of whom had third-trimester bleeding. One patient was diagnosed as having a normal placental implantation at midtrimester but placenta previa was demonstrated at delivery. The incidence of placenta previa at 16 to 18 weeks' was 5.3% and fell to 0.58% at delivery, indicating a 90% conversion rate. Thus the vast majority of cases of asymptomatic placenta previa remain so and convert before delivery. These patients should be observed with serial ultrasound at 6 to 8 week intervals until delivery or unequivocal conversion. No restriction in activity seems indicated unless the placenta previa persists beyond 30 weeks or becomes clinically manifest.",0
2383,"A method is described of measuring the lumbar spinal canal by pulsed echo ultrasound. It is simple, safe and has a high degree of accuracy.

2388,"From the published evidence there is no doubt that emergency physicians in America can undertake focused ultrasound examinations and that, by extrapolation, this would also be the case for UK emergency physicians. If this skill is to become part of the diagnostic armamentarium of the emergency physician, however, it needs to be demonstrated to be cost effective compared with the alternatives already available to the hospital. Trials to test for this benefit should adopt a hospital and not an emergency department perspective if the results are to influence health policy and specialty training.",0
2391,"Recent increases in the pressure output of diagnostic ultrasound scanners have led to an interest in establishing thresholds for bioeffects in many organs including the lungs of mammals. Damage may be mediated by inertial cavitation, yet there have been no such direct observations in vivo. To explore the hypothesis of cavitation-based bioeffects from diagnostic ultrasound, research has been performed on the thresholds of damage in rat lungs exposed to 4.0-MHz pulsed Doppler and color Doppler ultrasound. A 30-MHz active cavitation detection scheme complementing these studies provides the first direct evidence of cavitation in vivo from diagnostic ultrasound pulses.",0
2392,"BACKGROUND: Infantile intussusception often presents with symptoms more common to less dangerous conditions, and diagnosis must be established as early as possible. Clinical diagnosis is often wrong and contrast enema is invasive. Sonography is painless and harmless and if it provides a reliable method of diagnosis or exclusion of intussusception, diagnostic delay will be avoided. METHODS: In the John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, between 1993 and 1994, the names of all children referred for abdominal sonography with a degree of suspicion of intussusception were recorded, and the histories were subsequently reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty patients were studied. Forty-one patients had no sonographic evidence of intussusception and nine patients had positive findings. None of the 41 patients who had negative sonograms proved to have intussusception. The nine patients who had positive findings were subjected to air enema. In two patients the sonographic diagnosis was proved wrong. In the other seven patients it was confirmed. Thus there were two false positives and no false negatives. CONCLUSION: Sonography is a reliable aid to the clinical diagnosis of intussusception.",0
2394,"The heating of tissues by the absorption of ultrasound is an important safety consideration in the use of diagnostic ultrasound. This paper shows that models of ultrasonic heating for this situation need to take account of nonlinear propagation. Measurements were made of the temperature rise in a sample of tissue-mimicking gel, caused by the application of 3.6-MHz focused ultrasonic beams for 3 min. The propagation path to the focus was in water, to mimic the situation where the fetus is scanned through the full bladder. The effect of nonlinear propagation was seen by changing the pressure amplitude of the pulse, while altering the pulsing regime to preserve a constant spatial-peak temporal-average intensity of 1 W cm-2. When nonlinear distortion was present, an enhancement in the temperature rise was observed, which correlated with the value of the shock parameter. The enhancement ratio was typically up to a factor of 3, and the maximum temperature rise observed was 2 degrees C. This enhanced heating was seen both at the surface of the tissue-mimicking gel and after propagation through 23 mm of the material. Under conditions of nonlinear propagation, the maximum heating usually occurs in the prefocal region, rather than at the focus.",0
2395,"Ultrasound is a proved, safe diagnostic procedure. Its efficacy in the evaluation of 54 cases of scrotal pathology is reviewed.

2403,"A multiresolution texture segmentation (MTS) approach to image segmentation that addresses the issues of texture characterization, image resolution, and time to complete the segmentation is presented. The approach generalizes the conventional simulated annealing method to a multiresolution framework and minimizes an energy function that is dependent on the resolution of the size of the texture blocks in an image. A rigorous experimental procedure is also proposed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed MTS approach on the accuracy of the segmentation, the efficiency of the algorithm, and the use of varying features at different resolution. Semireal images, created by sampling a series of diagnostic ultrasound images of an ovary in vitro, were tested to produce statistical measures on the performance of the approach. The ultrasound images themselves were then segmented to determine if the approach can achieve accurate results for the intended ultrasound application. Experimental results suggest that the MTS approach converges faster and produces better segmentation results than the single-level approach.",0
2408,"An acoustic-thermal model was developed for scanned diagnostic ultrasound in soft tissue. An adiabatic surface between the transducer and the skin was justified, and the model accounted for attenuation and focusing. The temperature along the central plane of the temporally averaged acoustic field was calculated by integration of line sources of heat that result from the tissue's absorption of ultrasound. The temperature profiles were calculated for 1400 transducers. The results show that current diagnostic transducers heat more significantly at the transducer-tissue interface than at the focus. The temperature rise in the focal region is typically less than 25% of that at the surface. The acoustic power per scan length that results in a 1 degrees C temperature rise at the surface is calculated as (210 mW-MHz/cm)/f. These results apply to both linear arrays and sectorlike scan formats. The temperature rises for simultaneous multimode scanned beams are additive as the peak temperatures of each mode will occur on the surface. Consideration was given to the surface boundary condition for such models. This boundary is considered adiabatic for calculation of heating due to acoustic absorption alone. Additional heating or cooling resulting from the transducer can then be superimposed on this solution.",0
2411,"Among diagnostic postoperative procedures in renal cadaver transplantation echographic examination shows high sensitivity and specificity (over 80%). Urographic examination is in fact often dangerous and impossible in non-functioning grafts. Echography can reveal several liquid and solid collections such as hematomas, urinomas, abscesses, lymphatic collections and so on. Urinary obstructions caused by ureteral clots, calculi, external masses can be also detected through echographic examination. Vascular complications can be evaluated through echo and US Doppler examination showing arterial and venous complications. In most of cases acute and chronic graft rejection can be revealed through echo examination whereas in few cases diagnosis can be made only with the help of renal biopsy, laboratory findings and clinical conditions. In conclusion echography is a safe and reliable procedure in renal graft postoperative monitoring.",0
2416,"In 1976, Noyek observed that the thyroid cartilage framework of the larynx could be imaged by diagnostic ultrasound; the image appeared uniquely independent of the presence or absence of calcification. It was suggested that ultrasound, with its simple, nonroentgenographic, noninvasive features, might permit screening detection of thyroid cartilage destruction. It might, therefore, give direction to better computed tomographic (CT) imaging, and, specifically, more effectively identify T4 laryngeal cancer. Since that time, with improving generations of ultrasound transducers, more than 130 clinically correlated laryngeal ultrasound examinations have been recorded. Thirty CT, ultrasound, and pathologically correlated advanced cases of laryngeal carcinoma were critically evaluated by the Departments of Otolaryngology and Radiology at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto. Our diagnostic imaging approach has resulted in remarkably improved thyroid cartilage imaging by CT when ""directed"" by preliminary ultrasound.",0

Meanwhile the variety of biopsy needles has become huge, so that we can offer a special gadget for each indication and each organ. The results of investigations of the materials may help one to gain a general idea of the available possibilities and help to in the choice of the right one. In the special chapters about organs and tumour types one can find out which biopsy needles can achieve best results and guarantee the lowest possible level of complications. The path of access and possible injuries to important structures play an important role when choosing the size of the biopsy needle and the technique of puncture.

Using the ultrasound criteria for a correct and incorrect position of IUD, the criteria for an elevated risk for expulsion and contraindications for IUD application, the authors have used ultrasound technique for diagnosis in 65 patients with IUD. The causes for the ""wrong"" diagnosis were discussed: imperfection of the apparatuses, non-observance of the conditions for ultrasound examinations and lack of experience. Practical conclusions and recommendations for an increase of the effectively of this seemingly easy method for diagnosis and follow-up of the IUD were made.",0
2420,"Precise staging of malignant disease is required to define the optimum therapeutic strategy. In spite of technical advances, the sensitivity of conventional imaging techniques is usually limited to defining lesions of at least 1 cm in size. Laparoscopy is a sensitive technique that is very valuable for visual inspection of the abdominal cavity and the identification of small surface lesions. However, non-superficial lesions may escape detection due to the lack of tactile sensitivity. As an adjunct to laparoscopy, this study, utilizing a young swine model, has analyzed the detectability of intra-abdominal lymph nodes by laparoscopic ultrasound (LU). Lymph nodes in and around the hepatoduodenal ligament, examined and measured by LU, were resected by subsequent open laparotomy in eight young, mixed-breed swine. The numbers and sizes of lymph nodes detected by LU and resected at laparotomy were compared and analyzed statistically. Forty-six lymph nodes were resected by laparotomy, while LU failed to detect 3 small nodes (sensitivity, 43/46 = 93.5%). The sizes of lymph nodes in the LU group correlated strongly with the sizes actually measured in the laparotomy group (r = 0.936, P < 0.001). Twenty-six small lymph nodes, which conventional extracorporeal imaging might have failed to diagnose, were detected accurately by LU (r = 0.877, P < 0.001). This new technology may not only be effective for staging intra-abdominal malignant disease, but adds the benefit of obtaining tissue samples under direct vision using minimally invasive techniques.",0

2423,There were 738 fetal BPD determined in 468 normal obstetric patients between 16 and 43 weeks in whom (1) the size of the uterus on initial examination corresponded to the duration of amenorrhea +/- 1 week and (2) there were no complications during the pregnancy. The mean BPD +/- 2 S.D. was determined for each week. The rate of BPD growth was found to be 0.26 cm. per week from 18 to 38 weeks. One hundred random high-risk obstetric patients in whom the size of the uterus on initial examination corresponded to the weeks of amenorrhea +/- 1 week were studied. Two patterns of suspected IUGR are observed: one shows BPD values more than 2 S.D. below the mean; the other manifests a decreased delta BPD. Combinations of the two may be seen. At delivery seven neonates were identified who were SGA and could not be detected in utero by single BPD measurements.,0
2427,"Mares were subjected to frequent examination by diagnostic ultrasound and data were compiled with respect to reproductive efficiency. The data were collected over a 3-yr period on 1032 light horse mares. The cummulative pregnancy rate at 35 d post-ovulation was 96.8% and the pregnancy rate per cycle was 76.0% as determined by ultrasound examination. The average number of cycles per conception was 1.43, with an average of 2.29 inseminations per cycle. The incidence of early embryonic death was 7.8%. Mares were subjected to an average of 5.04 scans during the follicular phase of the cycle. The average number of ultrasound examinations per mare (including pregnancy examinations) was 9.99. Although these data were obtained from an experiment that did not use both control and treated mares, there was no indication that preovulatory oocytes or embryos were damaged by routine ultrasound examination. Comparisons with existing data from commercial facilities are difficult to make concerning any improvement in reproductive efficiency resulting from the routine use of ultrasonography, but these data do suggest relative safety in equine reproductive management when ultrasound examinations are conscientiously used.",0
2431,"Taekwondo is associated with an increased incidence of musculoskeletal injuries such as tendinopathy, synovitis, chondropathy, and ligament and meniscus injuries that may have an asymptomatic course in their initial stages, especially those located in the knee. OBJECTIVE: To describe the presence of morphostructural abnormalities in asymptomatic taekwondo athletes' (TKD) knees through the use of diagnostic ultrasound (US). METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive and comparative study. We evaluated 32 knees of 16 subjects (8 TKD and 8 recreational athletes). All subjects underwent sport-medical history and knee US. RESULTS: A variety of intra- and extra-articular morphostructural abnormalities were observed; the most frequent were synovitis, meniscal extrusion, and enthesopathy. CONCLUSIONS: The practice of Taekwondo abnormalities associated with an increased risk of knee injuries that may go unnoticed in the early stages. The use of US as an auxiliary tool in the diagnosis of these injuries and/or advisable since it can define in detail the anatomical structures subject to overuse, biomechanical stress, or repetitive trauma, and contribute to early detection of asymptomatic morphostructural alterations that may ensure timely preventive and therapeutic interventions.",0
2433,"The experience with 300 consecutive gynecologic patients undergoing diagnostic ultrasound has been evaluated. Follow-up was obtained by recording the clinical course and/or the operative findings. The ultrasound studies were diagnostic in 21 per cent, confirmatory in 74 per cent, and misleading in 5 per cent of the patients. Certain conditions lend themselves to diagnosis with ultrasound: hydatidiform mole, intrauterine pregnancy, dermoid cyst, ascites, simple ovarian cyst, and lost intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCD's). The studies in patients with chronic pelvic inflammatory disease or adhesions were occasionally misleading. Diagnostic ultrasound was particularly helpful in the obese patient, in whom adequate pelvic examination was difficult.",0
2435,"Fraser syndrome is a rare genetic syndrome with abnormalities of the head, lungs, kidneys, and limbs. A prenatal diagnosis of FS can be done in families with risk, using foetal ultrasonography. However, a wide qualitative and quantitative variability of possible abnormalities makes the diagnosis in utero notably questionable. We present the results of foetal ultrasonography in a tertigravida, had delivered two children with FS. Signs of foetal hypertelorism and microphthalmia, both traits typical for FS, were detected based on outer and inner orbital diameters and ocular diameters in 28 and 32 weeks of pregnancy. The clinical and pathological examinations after birth confirmed the diagnosis of FS. Our observation suggests that eye anomalies may prompt the diagnosis of FS even if characteristic lung and kidney abnormalities are absent. Therefore, we propose to regularly assess eye dimensions and distance, when performing any foetal ultrasonography in families with of FS.",0
2437,"Ultrasonography is a relatively new diagnostic aid in maxillofacial surgery. It can be used in maxillofacial surgery in three modifications: Doppler sonography, A-scan sonography, B-scan sonography. As clinicians we wanted to determine what contribution ultrasound examination has made to the diagnosis of superficial maxillofacial masses, when compared with clinical examination, intraoperative findings and with other methods of investigations. Since 1985 B-scan sonography has been performed in the examination of congenital, inflammatory and neoplastic masses of the head and neck on more than 1500 patients. The ultrasound examination was performed in the Department of Radiology by radiologists. The value of the ultrasound findings varied depending on the soft tissue lesions which were examined and the experience of the radiologists who performed the examination. The advantages of the diagnostic ultrasound are in being noninvasive, without any known deleterious biological effect, rapid, painless, inexpensive and easily reproducible. Ultrasonography is a procedure which nowadays is routinely performed in our department for the preoperative evaluation of our cancer patients and postoperative follow-up as well as for the patients with inflammations, diseases of the salivary glands and soft tissue swellings.",0

2441,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the application value of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in the diagnosis of chronic prostatitis. METHODS: TRUS and examination of prostatic secretion (EPS) were used in the diagnosis of 3 500 cases of chronic prostatitis from September, 2000 to May, 2006. RESULTS: Lower resonance of the inner gland, low-level echo, uneven echo light spots, incomplete outlines and unsmooth borderlines were found in 2279 cases (65.1%), and the enlarged prostate in 1 084 cases (31.0%), with clear integrated amicula and enhanced echogenic spots at the juncture of the external and inner gland. No obvious changes were noted in 137 cases (4.0%), and in another 391 cases (11.2%) were detected alteration of the acoustic image of cystospermitis and blurred margins and uneven echoes of the seminal vesicle. The WBC count in EPS was < 10/HP in 132 cases (3.8%), 10-19/HP in 2 156 cases (61.6%) and > or =20/HP in 1212 cases (34.6%). CONCLUSION: TRUS, as a diagnostic means for chronic prostatitis, can be easily performed and causes little pain and therefore is readily accepted by patients. Combined with EPS, TRUS can provide more definite diagnostic evidence, and for those who are afraid of pain and reject EPS, it is a desirable alternative in the diagnosis of chronic prostatitis.",0
2442,"To appreciate the number of ultrasound studies of different types done within a population consisting of both rural and urban persons, a questionnaire was sent to all ultrasound facilities within the Canadian Province of British Columbia. All of the questionnaires were returned, providing complete data for 1978, 1979, and 1980. In addition to data on numbers of ultrasound studies (broken into various categories), the number of sonographers and sonologists were also analyzed. The results show an 87% increase from 1978 to 1980 in the number of studies, and, in 1980, a rate of 37 ultrasound procedures per thousand population per year (52 per thousand in the largest urban area in the province).

2448,"The A-scan ultrasound technique was used to examine the vitreous bodies of both the sick and the healthy eye in 47 patients with acute iritis. The acoustic findings were then compared to observations made with the slit lamp. Of the 47 iritis eyes, only 19 were amenable to a least some degree of optical examination. The most common factors preventing optical examination were opacity of the aqueous humor and posterior synechia. Comparison of optical and acoustic findings were difficult, since optical examination was possible in only 19 eyes. It would seem, however, that there is a farily close correlation between acoustic and optical findings. Ultrasound often offers the only possibility of ascertaining the presence and degree of exudation in cases of acute iritis, and such information may be important in planning treatment and following the course of the disease.",0

2471,"In gastric cancer, retrogastric invasion or enlarged lymph nodes in the hilus of the spleen or at the celiac trunk can readily visualized with laparoscopic ultrasound examination (LUS). Invasion or metastases of the liver can be identified which are ""invisible"" with the ""classic"" imaging methods. In our series this led to revision of the TNM staging in 8% of 111 patients with advanced gastric carcinoma. In the staging of early pancreas cancer the standard methods of investigation, including ERCP, are unsatisfactory. Tumor localization, invasion of blood vessels and local or distal lymph node metastases cannot always be evaluated reliably. LUS promises to provide this valuable information. In carcinoma of the distal esophagus or the cardia, LUS can help to exclude small liver metastases, assess invasion of the diaphragm and evaluate the extent of enlarged intraabdominal lymph nodes, especially those at the celiac trunk. A frequent challenge/task for LUS is the exact determination of the benign or malignant nature of liver foci. Quite commonly they are inaccessible to percutaneous CT-guided puncture, but can be easily reached and biopsied under direct vision or LUS-guidance. By virtue of LUS and its information about extrahepatic lymph node infliction, diagnostic laparoscopy is now a less invasive but equally valid substitute for diagnostic laparotomy prior to liver transplantation in oncological diseases. LUS is now well established in diagnostic laparoscopy as a reliable tool for the preoperative staging of distal esophageal and abdominal tumors. It provides additional information which cannot be obtained with conventional imaging procedures.",0
2472,"Diagnostic ultrasound is not totally free of side effects. Therefore, the principle of good clinical practise and ALARA must be considered.

In particular the problem of distinguishing a fetal heart from large pulsating mediastinal vessels, which can be present in these fetuses, and the difficulty of diagnosing death in an acardiac fetus. Our report confirms that the co-twin remains at increased risk of sudden death, even without ultrasound evidence of cardiac failure or biochemical compromise.

High-resolution sonography is thus the only diagnostic imaging method which helps to evaluate preoperatively malignant melanomas.",0
2481,"To evaluate the diagnostic role of ultrasound in spontaneous renal allograft rupture we reviewed 18 cases observed in our centre in 10 years. Ultrasound studies were performed immediately before surgery in 15 cases. Renal allograft rupture occurred during the first 3 weeks after transplantation in 17 cases (94%). Clinical findings were consistent with previous reports. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgical exploration in 17 cases, and by necropsy in the remaining one. Nine patients were treated by corsetage and eight by graft nephrectomy, while one patient died before surgery. Acute rejection was present in nine cases, and severe acute tubular necrosis in five; no renal tissue was available for histological study in four patients. On ultrasound examination, perirenal haematoma was the most frequent finding, while subcapsular/intrarenal haematoma or findings suggesting rejection or urinary tract obstruction were less frequently observed. In six cases, disruption of the white linear echoes of the capsule of the graft could be seen; this finding has not been described previously. Ultrasound has a definite role in presurgical evaluation of suspected renal transplant rupture.",0

METHODS: Using the electron microscopy, the effect of B-mode ultrasound and color Doppler flow image on villus of early pregnancy were studied. 46 cases of early pregnancy women were divided into five groups: Groups 1 : control group; Group II and III: 24 +/- 1 hours after exposure to B mode and color Doppler ultrasound for 30 minutes respectively; Group IV and V: 72 +/- 1 hours after exposure to B mode and color Doppler ultrasound for 30 minutes respectively. RESULTS: Expansion of perinuclear space in cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts, enlargement of rough endoplasmic reticulum, and vacuolization in the cytoplasm were found in Group II and III. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the main injured sites after exposure to ultrasound were the plasma membrane and suborganelles. These changes disappeared within 3 days.",0
2484,"Ultrasonograms of 214 ovarian masses in 184 patients were studied to discriminate ovarian malignancies from benign masses and to help in developing a new scoring system using ultrasonographic findings with weight-adjusted scores. The 76 masses that showed cystic patterns only were directly determined to be benign, having an expected success rate of 97.4%. The remaining 138 masses, of which 116 showed mixed patterns and 22 of which showed solid patterns, were analyzed by the Quantification method No. 2 of Hayashi to select the effective ultrasonic findings and to obtain a good discriminant function. Eleven findings (items) expressing 29 categories were selected, and a discriminant function composed with a weight-adjusted score for each category was obtained as the result of the analysis. Using these functions, the 86.6% of the ovarian masses with mixed or solid patterns were correctly discriminated as being malignant, borderline-malignant, or benign. According to internal checks of all ovarian masses, the success rate was 90.2%. Then 73 ovarian masses of 65 new patients were discriminated as the external check, and a success rate of 93.2% was obtained. It is concluded that this newly developed scoring system using ultrasonic findings is useful in discriminating ovarian malignancies from benign ones.",0

The induction of DNA single strand breaks was tested in CHO cells treated with continuous wave ultrasound. Following sonication an endonuclease was introduced into the cells converting single strand breaks to chromosomal aberrations scorable in the following metaphase. 3. The influence of DUS on the number of point mutations was evaluated in the Ames test. A tester strain of Salmonella typhimurium indicating base substitutions was sonicated. At the present stage, all results proved to be completely negative and could thus not support the view of any mutagenic activity of diagnostic ultrasound.",0

2500,"Loss of pressure across a stenosis depends on the geometry of that obstruction, but flow only depends on geometry when both perfusion pressure and peripheral resistance are constant. As cerebrovascular resistance is generally low then flow over a stenosis will be dominated by stenotic resistance. A relatively modest reduction in systolic perfusion pressure will produce a large increase in stenotic resistance. Evaluation of a 'haemodynamically significant' or 'critical' or 'dynamic' stenosis should include consideration of variations in cardiac function and blood pressure as well as local vascular dynamics. Examination of the ultrasound image characteristics of the arterial lesion gives additional structural information of the contents and surface of the lesion and any movement relative to the vessel wall. This may give guidance in separating clinically stable from unstable lesions, and also in following progression or regression of disease. The physical forces which are applied to some lesions may cause the release of material from the substance of the lesion into the arterial lumen or cause damage resulting in progression of the lesion itself.",0
2508,"The therapeutic approach to ectopic pregnancy (EP) has changed over the last decade. A prerequisite for a differentiated management is an early diagnosis of EP. This can be achieved by transvaginal sonography (TVS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of TVS in the diagnosis of EP. 184 patients with clinically suspected ectopic pregnancy were examined by TVS. In 103 cases suspicion of EP was confirmed, in 81 cases it was ruled out. All cases were evaluated by laparoscopy, D&C, serial HCG determinations or sonographic follow-up in case of an intrauterine pregnancy. Sensitivity of TVS in the diagnosis of EP was 96%, specificity 88%, the positive predictive value was 89%, the negative predictive value was 95%. Four cases with a false negative result at TVS were very early in pregnancy and were subjected to laparoscopy because of persistent high HCG values without demonstration of an intrauterine pregnancy. Five cases of sonographically confirmed ectopic pregnancies were missed by the first laparoscopy. These cases required intervention because of clinical symptoms and had low levels of HCG. TVS has a high diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.",0

STUDY DESIGN: A comparative study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Ningbo No. 6 Hospital, China, from September 2017 to February 2020. METHODOLOGY: Eighty patients with rheumatoid finger arthritis (570 finger joints) were examined by MSUS and MRI. Detection rates of the two methods for diagnosing the pathological features of rheumatoid arthritis, levels of the serum markers rheumatoid factor (RF), etc, were compared. RESULTS: Detection rate of joint effusion by MSUS was higher than MRI (p <0.001). Spearman's correlation analysis showed that synovial blood flow signal grade was positively correlated with serum RF, anti-CCP, ESR, CRP, IL-6, and IL-33 levels (r = 0.853, p <0.001; r = 0.864, p <0.001; r = 0.866, p <0.001; r = 0.846, p <0.001; r = 0.881, p <0.001; and r = 0.873, p <0.001, respectively). Resistive index value of intra-synovial artery in active patients was lower than in define inactive patients (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Compared to MRI, MSUS has a higher detection rate of joint effusion in RA patients.

Timely aspiration of the affected joint for definitive diagnosis and treatment in the office is desirable but can be difficult, especially if the joint is small, surrounded by soft tissue swelling distorting landmarks, and is very painful to move or palpate. METHODS: We compared the likelihood of successful aspiration of the great toe metatarsophalangeal joint by primary care internists for the diagnosis of potential crystalline arthritis by either landmark identification of the joint space or by employing ultrasound to identify the joint space. RESULTS: Aspiration was performed by one of 2 primary care internists using landmarks and palpation to identify the joint space in 27 patients with suspected crystalline arthritis affecting the first metatarsophalangeal joint. A sample adequate for diagnosis by polarized light microscopic crystal analysis was obtained in 14 of the 27 aspirations (52%) when landmarks alone were used to locate the joint space. In an additional 27 patients with suspected crystalline arthritis affecting the first metatarsophalangeal joint, ultrasound was used to identify the joint space and resulted in a significant increase in the success of obtaining an adequate diagnostic sample, which was obtained in 25 of the 27 aspirations (93%). CONCLUSIONS: The primary care internist can easily provide quality and timely small joint diagnostic aspiration when ultrasound is used to identify the location of the joint space.",0
2598,"Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) is an emergent and common pulmonary vascular disease. The most common diagnostic method for PTE is computer-aided tomography angiography. Endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS) is used in diagnosis and staging of lung cancer via transbronchial needle aspiration from mediastinal lymphadenopathies and central masses. Diagnosis of PTE with EBUS is not common, although this technique helps to monitor pulmonary vasculature. The present case, a 60-year-old female patient to whom EBUS was applied because of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, was diagnosed as incidental PTE.",0
2600,"Diagnostic ultrasound (US) is safe. Short interference (si) RNA of Frizzled (Fz)-9 suppresses proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. siRNA was introduced into Hep3B cells, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, with transfection or US upward to culture plates at mechanical index (MI) = 0.4 or 0.8. siRNA of Fz9 was introduced for western blot analysis and cell proliferation assay. siRNA of Fz9 suppressed cell proliferation to 32.8±13.6% at 200 nM (P<0.0001) with transfection. With US, cell proliferation decreased to 36.9±15.1% at 200 nM (P=0.039) at 0.4 of MI while 49.2±12.0% at 200 nM (P=0.041) at MI=0.8. Western blot analysis showed that 200 nM of siRNA decreased the expression of Fz9 with US at MI=0.4 and MI=0.8. No change was seen in cell proliferation between transfection and US. siRNA was introduced into cultured cells and functioned with US.",0
2602,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to validate surgeon-performed abdominal ultrasound in the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, thus expediting diagnosis and management and increasing overall cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A surgical resident, after completing ultrasound courses offered by the American College of Surgeons, Chicago, IL, examined 30 consecutive patients with a suspected diagnosis of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS). Blinded regarding both clinical and radiographic findings, the resident scanned the pylorus in longitudinal and transverse axes. Positive ultrasonographic evidence of HPS was defined as muscle thickness of at least 4 mm and/or channel length of at least 16 mm. Surgeon and radiology measurements were compared using descriptive analyses and Student t test. RESULTS: There were 25 boys and 5 girls examined. Twenty-eight of 30 patients were found to have HPS. When ultrasound performed by the surgeon was compared with that of radiology, no false-negative or false-positive results were noted. The surgeon was diagnostically accurate in all cases, and there was no statistically significant difference between surgeon and radiology measurements with regard to pyloric muscle thickness (P = .825, mean deviation = 0.4 mm) or channel length (P = .74, mean deviation = 2.2 mm). CONCLUSION: A surgeon with appropriate training in abdominal ultrasound can diagnose HPS with the same degree of accuracy as radiologists.",0
2603,"AIM: In a prospective study we investigated if the endoscopical evaluation of the bleeding risk of esophageal varices in cirrhotics could be improved by additional duplex sonography of the portal vein. METHOD: The trial involved 41 patients with endoscopically diagnosed esophageal varices (27 male, 14 female) who were followed up over a period of 30 months (mean of 13 +/- 3). According to the Child-Pugh-Turcotte -classification, 14 patients were classified as grade A, another 14 as grade B, and 13 as grade C. The cause of the cirrhosis included virus infection (n = 14), alcohol (n = 17) and miscellaneous disorders (n = 9, primary biliary = 3, autoimmune = 2, idiopathic = 4). RESULTS: During the observation time, 17 patients who developed an acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage were put in the bleeding group (mean portal flow velocity Vm = 9.29 +/- 3.31 cm/s, mean flow volume Fm = 371 +/- 173 ml/min), while the remaining 24 patients formed the non-bleeding group (Vm = 13.29 +/- 5.12 cm/s, FV = 500 +/- 200 ml/min). The bleeding group had significantly lower mean portal flow velocities (p < 0.017) and mean flow volumes (p < 0.05) than the non-bleeding group. By adopting cut-off values of 12 cm/s for Vm and 420 ml/min for FV we obtained a diagnostic sensitivity for predicting esophageal variceal hemorrhage of 0.88 and 0.65 respectively. CONCLUSION: Portal duplex sonography may improve the evaluation of bleeding risk in patients wit endoscopically diagnosed esophageal varices and could influence the decision for prophylactic treatment.",0
2604,"The diagnostic possibilities and limitations of A-mode ultrasound of maxillary sinus diseases are presented. A group of 219 subjects suffering from various sinus diseases was examined. All cases were analyzed in parallel by means of X-rays, sinoscopy and ultrasonography. The investigated group was divided into seven subgroups, according to clinical entity (polypoid degeneration, polyps, cysts, et cetera). The comparison of the three techniques was made for each clinical entity. Some divergent findings that can be reached by these techniques were explained from the clinical point of view as well. The ultrasound A-mode technique plays a complementary role in the diagnostic process of maxillary sinus diseases. The main advantages of ultrasound technique are its harmlessness and non-invasivity.",0
2605,"BACKGROUND: Visual examination and cutaneous biopsies, two major tools in dermatologic diagnosis, do not provide structural information regarding the entire tissue volume. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to develop a high-resolution ultrasound system that quickly, with minimal operator interaction, displays structural data on the entire tissue volume. METHODS: A prototype ultrasound B-scan system was developed and operated at nominal center frequencies between 35 and 50 MHz, with computer processing of data to produce three-dimensional images. These images displayed as three-dimensional ""blocks"" can be sectioned to provide multiple images of internal structure (i.e., ""acoustic biopsies""). RESULTS: B-scans and associated three-dimensional images were obtained from assorted skin sites in selected patients. CONCLUSION: This technique provides a valuable diagnostic tool that is now being further evaluated.",0
2606,"Of 178 consecutive twin pregnancies, 63 were both monozygotic and also studied prenatally by real-time B-scan (and usually Doppler) ultrasound. The 48 pregnancies with monochorionic placentas (in which vascular anastomoses are almost universal) were compared with the 15 monozygotic pregnancies having dichorionic placentas. The type of placenta found at delivery was predicted with substantial accuracy by ultrasound examination in mid-pregnancy. We were unable to identify any inter-group difference in fetal growth rate, discordance of fetal growth between twins or pattern of umbilical artery flow velocity waveform. In the absence of the rare florid twin transfusion syndrome, the vascular anastomoses that have been shown to be common in monochorionic placentas do not exert a strong influence on fetal growth or fetoplacental blood flow.",0
2607,Streaming is shown to occur in water in the focused beams produced by a number of medical pulse-echo devices. The use of hot film anemometry to measure the streaming velocity is described and velocities measured in water using commercial equipment are quoted. The highest velocities occur in pulsed Doppler mode with a maximum velocity of 14 cm s-1 being observed. An experimental set-up was used to investigate the parameters affecting streaming and it was found that the harmonic content of the pulse waveform had a major effect on the streaming velocity. The time taken for a stream to become established at the focus of the acoustic beams studied was typically approximately 0.5 s.,0

2610,"Analyses of the data on the ultrasonic diagnostic accuracies are presented for the cases of hydatidiform mole and ovarian tumors. These data are derived from two sources: the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center (SUNY-DMC) and the Chiba University School of Medicine (Chiba U.), Japan. Diagnosis of hydatidiform mole was correct in 47 (92.2%) of 51 (SUNY-DMC) and 66 (91.6%) of 72 cases (Chiba U.). The incidences of lutein cysts were 29.4% (SUNY-DMC) and 18.1%. (Chiba U.). Ultrasound plays an important role in the postmolar follow-up: increased intrauterine echoes in the subinvoluted uterus may signal a developing invasive mole or choriocarcinoma. Ultrasonic diagnoses of 223 (SUNY-DMC) and 183 (Chiba U.) ovarian tumors have been analyzed and the rates of diagnostic errors for the individual tumors are presented. Solid ovarian tumors appear to be more difficult to diagnose than cystic ovarian tumors.",0
2613,"Recent theoretical calculations have shown that small gas nuclei in water exposed to microsecond ultrasonic pulses above an intensity threshold may grow into transient cavities that collapse violently, leading to the formation of .OH radicals and .H atoms. We have detected these free radicals in aqueous solutions exposed to microsecond pulsed ultrasound using spin trapping and electron spin resonance (ESR). The public health implications of our results are discussed.",0
2615,"Current descriptions of ultrasound evaluations, including use of the term ""point-of-care ultrasound"" (POCUS), are imprecise because they are predicated on distinctions based on the device used to obtain images, the location where the images were obtained, the provider who obtained the images, or the focus of the examination. This is confusing because it does not account for more meaningful distinctions based on the setting, comprehensiveness, and completeness of the evaluation. In this article, the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound and the members of the American College of Radiology Ultrasound Commission articulate a map of the ultrasound landscape that divides sonographic evaluations into four distinct categories on the basis of setting, comprehensiveness, and completeness. Details of this classification scheme are elaborated, including important clarifications regarding what ensures comprehensiveness and completeness. Practical implications of this framework for future research and reimbursement paradigms are highlighted.",0
2616,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the added value of simultaneous imaging of intravenously infused microbubbles that are being used to dissolve an intravascular thrombus with therapeutic ultrasound (TUS). METHODS: In a chronic canine arteriovenous graft occluded by a thrombus, TUS (1 MHz) was applied through a 6-cm-thick tissue-mimicking phantom (measured mean +/- SD peak negative pressure through the phantom, 958 +/- 104 kPa) during an intravenous infusion of either saline (n = 6 occlusions) or lipid-encapsulated microbubbles (ImaRx Therapeutics, Inc, Tucson, AZ). Therapeutic ultrasound was intermittently applied during the microbubble infusion either at set time intervals (n = 6 occlusions) or when simultaneous diagnostic ultrasound (DUS) indicated a sustained presence of microbubbles (n = 12 occlusions). Success was defined as return of rapid flow within the graft (grade 3 flow). RESULTS: Diagnostic ultrasound showed microbubbles moving through small channels within the thrombus before angiographic evidence of flow in the graft. This guided the timing of TUS application better than using set time intervals. Angiographic clearance of the thrombus and restoration of grade 3 flow at 45 minutes of treatment were seen in 33% of deeply located thrombosed grafts treated with TUS at set time intervals and 92% of grafts treated with TUS guided by DUS (P < .001 compared with set time intervals). CONCLUSIONS: The use of TUS with intravenous microbubbles has a high success rate in recanalizing deeply located thrombosed arteriovenous grafts when performed with DUS guidance.",0
2617,"BACKGROUND: Thyroid nodular disease is a common disorder. Ultrasonography has emerged as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of thyroid disease owing to its high operational simplicity, non-invasiveness and reproducibility. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the value of ultrasound elastography and conventional ultrasound for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules. METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and VIP databases were searched systematically. RevMan 5.3 software was used to draw a risk bias map, and Stata 16.0 was used to plot a sensitivity and specificity forest map. A summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) curve was plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Meta-regression was used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: The sensitivity of conventional ultrasonography for detecting thyroid nodules was 0.55 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45-0.65], the specificity was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87-0.93), the positive likelihood ratio was 5.8 (95% CI: 3.8-8.9), the negative likelihood ratio was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.39-0.6), and the AUC was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.82-0.88). The sensitivity of ultrasonic elastography for detecting thyroid nodules was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.60-0.73), the specificity was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90-0.95), the positive likelihood ratio was 9.1 (95% CI: 6.3-13.3), the negative likelihood ratio was 0.36 (95% CI: 0.29-0.44), and the AUC was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.91). The sensitivity of conventional ultrasound combined with ultrasonic elastography for detecting thyroid nodules was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84-0.90), the specificity of the combined approach was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93-0.98), the positive likelihood ratio was 23.3 (95% CI: 12.4-43.6), the negative likelihood ratio was 0.13 (95% CI: 0.10-0.17), and the AUC was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.94). Age, region, research type, conventional ultrasound evaluation criteria and elastography evaluation criteria had specific effects on sensitivity and specificity when detecting thyroid nodules. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional ultrasound can be used as a routine examination technique for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules, while ultrasound elastography can improve the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis. The diagnostic value of conventional ultrasound combined with ultrasound elastography is higher than that of a single diagnostic method.",0
2618,"Diagnostic value of ultrasound score, color Doppler ultrasound resistance index (RI) and spiral computed tomography (CT) for ovarian tumors was investigated. In total 224 patients pathologically diagnosed with ovarian tumor after operation in Cangzhou Central Hospital were selected, including 120 patients with benign ovarian tumor and 104 patients with malignant ovarian tumor. Patients with benign and malignant tumors were scored according to the ultrasound scoring criteria. The color Doppler ultrasound examination was performed and the corresponding RI was recorded. At the same time, 64-slice spiral CT was performed, and results were compared with the postoperative pathological diagnosis. Also, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the combined application of the three methods were detected. The RI value of benign ovarian tumor was higher than that of malignant ovarian tumor, displaying statistically significant difference (P<0.05). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the combined application of the three methods were 96.49, 90.91 and 93.75%, respectively. Ultrasound scoring, color Doppler ultrasound RI and 64-slice spiral CT have good diagnostic value for ovarian tumor, and the diagnostic accuracy rate of the combined application is higher. Therefore, different examination methods can be selected in clinic according to the different situations.",0
2619,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this technical report is to review the sonographic spectrum of abnormalities accounting for peri-articular pain after knee replacement surgery, as well as to demonstrate the clinical utility of ultrasound in the diagnosis and treatment of this subset of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Utilizing an imaging report database, we performed a search for ultrasound examinations performed by a single radiologist for knee pain after knee arthroplasty at our institution over a 10-year period. The search yielded 63 patients, whom we have categorized by causative pathology, with representative diagnostic and procedural ultrasound images selected for inclusion. RESULTS: Our search yielded multiple causes of peri-articular knee pain after arthroplasty, including medial and lateral retinacular impingement and scarring, iliotibial band or conjoined tendon irritation, popliteus tendon impingement, medial collateral ligament impingement, pes anserine bursitis, and scarring of Hoffa's fat pad. CONCLUSION: While knee arthroplasty is an often-successful procedure, it can be complicated by post-operative peri-articular knee pain. Ultrasound provides a valuable tool for the diagnosis of painful peri-articular knee pathology, as it allows for both static and dynamic evaluation, as well as direct correlation with patient symptoms, and is not confounded by the metal components. In addition to its diagnostic utility, ultrasound can also guide diagnostic and/or therapeutic injections of anesthetic and corticosteroid. Given these advantages, ultrasound is an important tool in managing the painful post-arthroplasty knee.",0
2620,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the work described here was to assess the performance of automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) as an adjunct to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in the screening and diagnostic setting. METHODS: This cross-sectional study of women who underwent DBT and ABUS from December 2019 to March 2022 included opportunistic and targeted screening cases, as well as symptomatic women. Breast density, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System categories and histopathology reports were collected and compared. The PPV3 (proportion of examinations with abnormal findings that resulted in a tissue diagnosis of cancer), biopsy rate (percentage of biopsies performed) and cancer detection yield (number of malignancies found by the diagnostic test given to the study sample) were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 1089 ABUS examinations were performed (age range: 29-85 y, mean: 51.9 y). Among these were 909 screening (83.5%) and 180 diagnostic (16.5%) examinations. A total of 579 biopsies were performed on 407 patients, with a biopsy rate of 53.2%. There were 100 (9.2%) malignant lesions, 30 (5.2%) atypical/B3 lesions and 414 (71.5%) benign cases. In 9 cases (0.08%), ABUS alone detected malignancies, and in 19 cases (1.7%), DBT alone detected malignancies. The PPV3 in the screening group was 14.6%. CONCLUSION: ABUS is useful as an adjunct to DBT in the opportunistic screening and diagnostic setting.",0
2621,"BACKGROUND: Few reports explore the frequency and factors associated with diagnostic ultrasound (US) for midgut volvulus. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate predictive factors for diagnostic US for midgut volvulus and clinical outcomes of patients with non-diagnostic US. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included infants imaged for midgut volvulus with US. Exams were rated as diagnostic (midgut volvulus present or absent) or non-diagnostic by a pediatric radiologist, and in cases of disagreement with the original report, an additional pediatric radiologist was the tie-breaker. For each exam, the following were recorded: age, weight, respiratory support, exam indication, sonographer experience, and gaseous dilated bowel loops on radiography. Logistic regression models with ""stepwise"" variable selection were used to investigate the association of diagnostic US for midgut volvulus with each of the independent variables. RESULTS: One hundred nineteen patients were imaged. US was diagnostic in 74% (88/119) of patients. In subsets of patients presenting with bilious emesis or age <28 days, US was diagnostic in 92% (22/24) and 90% (53/59), respectively. Logistic regression suggested that symptom type (bilious vs other) was the best predictor of diagnostic US (type 3 P=0.02). Out of 26 patients with available radiographs, US was diagnostic in 92% (12/13) of patients without bowel dilation on radiographs compared to 62% (8/13) of patients with bowel dilation (P=0.16). Weight, respiratory support, and sonographer experience did not differ between groups. Two sick neonates, ages 2 days and 30 days, in whom the primary clinical concern was dropping hematocrit and sepsis, respectively, had non-diagnostic ultrasounds in the setting of bowel dilation on radiography. Both were found to have midgut volvulus at surgery and both expired. CONCLUSION: US was most frequently diagnostic in patients with bilious emesis or age less than 28 days. Non-diagnostic US for midgut volvulus must prompt a predetermined follow-up strategy, such as an additional imaging study (e.g., upper GI series), particularly in a sick child, as non-diagnostic US may miss midgut volvulus.",0
2622,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the clinical value of ultrasonic Doppler examination and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) in the circulation of septic acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: Patients with intensive care unit-related infection were divided into AKI group and control groups. The AKI group was divided into three subgroups according to the serum creatinine value: stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3. Relevant parameters and blood flow of the renal artery were measured, and further contrast-enhanced US was performed and time-intensity curve was analyzed. RESULTS: The renal blood flow (RBF) and time-averaged velocity decreased significantly in the AKI group compared with the control group (p = .021 and p = .001). The peak value decreased and time to peak (TTP) prolonged in the AKI group (p < .001). With the aggravation of the disease, the RBF decreased slightly among subgroups (p = 0.124). However, the peak value gradually decreased and the TTP prolonged (all p < .05). The multiple linear regression model showed that only PI, RI, and TTP were independently and linearly correlated with the serum creatinine value. CONCLUSIONS: Doppler US and contrast-enhanced US are of great help in the detection of condition changes and prognosis of patients with sepsis-induced AKI.",0
2624,"OBJECTIVES: To increase the specificity of motor unit potential (MUPs) detection by using ultrasound guided electromyography (USG-EMG) in patients with muscle plegia due to traumatic nerve lesions. METHODS: Forty-six patients with recent nerve trauma underwent baseline standard EMG (ST-EMG) evaluation with evidence of absent MUPs. In 41 of them, ST-EMG was repeated after 2-3 months (T1) and the patients were accordingly divided in two groups: ST-EMG+ (if MUPs were detected) or ST-EMG- (MUPs not detected). Then, ST-EMG- patients underwent muscle ultrasound evaluation (M-US) and, if isles of muscular contractility were found, they also had USG-EMG. The same protocol was repeated 4-6 months after baseline (T2). RESULTS: At T1, 22/41 patients were ST-EMG+. While 19/41 were ST-EMG-; 9 of these patients had M-US consistent with residual muscular activity, for that reasons underwent USG-EMG with 7 of 9 demonstrating MUPs (at T2 all of these 7 patients resulted ST-EMG). In the other 2 patients, we found no MUPs at T1 but they became ST-EMG+ or USG-EMG positive at T2. The remaining 10 ST-EMG- patients had no EMG or US evidence of muscle contraction at T1, but at T2 2 of 10 became ST-EMG+ and 2 had USG-EMG showing MUPs. In the remaining 6 patients still M-US negative at T2, complete denervation was diagnosed. Concerning the 22 patients who were ST-EMG+ at T1, all but one showed increase of MUPs at T2. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated the utility of US guidance when performing EMG evaluation in locating isles of muscular contractility in patients who have no detectable MUPs on EMG after nerve trauma. SIGNIFICANCE: USG-EMG significantly increases the specificity of needle EMG allowing earlier detection of MUPs.",0
2625,"Objective: We investigated the diagnostic efficacy of power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) to detect enthesitis in Japanese patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA).Methods: This was a single-center cohort study of patients with peripheral symptoms suggestive of SpA. Articular synovia, tendons, and entheses were assessed by PDUS at baseline. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings and classification criteria for SpA were also evaluated.Results: 136 patients were consecutively evaluated. A definite diagnosis was obtained in 111 patients, including 72 with SpA and 39 non-SpA. Among the patients with SpA, PDUS demonstrated articular synovitis in 40 of the 72 patients (56%), tenosynovitis or peritendinitis in 48 (67%), and enthesitis in 63 (88%). Considering PDUS alone, enthesitis in at least one site was the most useful means of differentiating SpA from non-SpA (sensitivity 87.5%; specificity 82.1%; accuracy 85.6%; positive likelihood ratio 4.88). Combining that finding along with fulfillment of Amor, European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group, or Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria for peripheral SpA increased the specificity of the diagnosis (92.5%, 92.3%, and 97.4%, respectively).Conclusion: PDUS enthesitis is useful for the diagnosis of SpA with peripheral symptoms. Combining PDUS enthesitis with established SpA classification criteria is beneficial in diagnosing peripheral SpA.",0
2626,"OBJECTIVE: To determine interobserver variability of nerve ultrasound in peripheral neuropathy in a prospective, systematic, multicenter study. METHODS: We enrolled 20 patients with an acquired chronic demyelinating or axonal polyneuropathy and 10 healthy controls in 3 different centers. All participants underwent an extensive nerve ultrasound protocol, including cross-sectional area measurements of median, ulnar, fibular, tibial, and sural nerves, and brachial plexus. Real-time image acquisition was performed blind by a local and a visiting investigator (reference). Five patients were investigated using different types of sonographic devices. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated, and a random-effects model was fitted to identify factors with significant effect on interobserver variability. RESULTS: Systematic differences between measurements made by different investigators were small (mean difference 0.11 mm2 [95% confidence interval 0.00-0.23 mm2]). Intraclass correlation coefficients were generally higher in arm nerves (0.48-0.96) than leg nerves (0.46-0.61). The hospital site and sonographic device did not contribute significantly to interobserver variability in the random-effects model. CONCLUSIONS: Interobserver variability of nerve ultrasound in peripheral neuropathy is generally limited, especially in arm nerves. Different devices and a multicenter setting have no effect on interobserver variability. Therefore, nerve ultrasound is a reproducible tool for diagnostics in routine clinical practice and (multicenter) research.",0
2627,"Pulmonary capillary hemorrhage (PCH) can be induced by diagnostic ultrasound-a potential safety issue. Anesthetized rats were intubated for intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) with 0 end-expiratory pressure, +4 cm H2O end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and -4 cm H2O end-expiratory pressure (NEEP). Rats were imaged at 7.6 MHz with a Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine. The output was low (mechanical index [MI] = 0.22) for aiming and then was raised for 5 min in 20 different exposure groups with n = 8. Peak rarefactional pressure amplitudes were measured in water and de-rated for chest attenuation. The PCH areas were measured on the lung surface. At 2.2 MPa, PCH was 9.3 ± 6.6 mm2 for IPPV, 1.6 ± 3.2 mm2 for PEEP (p <0.001) and 26.8 ± 6.4 mm2 for NEEP (p <0.001). Thresholds were 1.3 MPa for IPPV, 2.1 MPa for PEEP and 1.0 MPa for NEEP. The small ventilator pressures subtracted or added to trans-capillary stress generated by diagnostic ultrasound pulses, virtually eliminating PCH for PEEP but enhancing PCH for NEEP.",0
2629,"OBJECTIVES: To establish the diagnostic accuracy of obstetric ultrasound at a tertiary fetal medicine center in the prenatal detection of unilateral and bilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) in fetuses in which this condition was suspected, and to undertake a systematic review of the relevant literature. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of all cases referred to a regional tertiary fetal medicine unit due to suspicion of either unilateral or bilateral MCDK between 1997 and 2015. Diagnosis was confirmed by postnatal ultrasound reports or postmortem examination. The accuracy of prenatal ultrasound in the diagnosis of MCDK was calculated. Using a systematic search strategy we also performed a review of the literature regarding the prenatal diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy of MCDK. RESULTS: We included 144 women in our analysis; 37 (25.7%) opted for pregnancy termination (TOP) (due to unilateral MCDK with additional abnormalities, suspected bilateral MCDK or severe obstructive uropathy). Complete pre- and postnatal data were available in 126 pregnancies, including 104 livebirths, 19 TOPs with postmortem findings available and three intrauterine fetal deaths. Two infants died shortly after birth (due to known bilateral MCDK or known cranial vault defect). The overall number of cases of MCDK confirmed postnatally was 100; of these, 98 were diagnosed prenatally (true positive), while two were thought to be hydronephrosis prenatally (false negative) and the diagnosis of MCDK was made after birth. In nine cases, the initial antenatal diagnosis of suspected MCDK was revised, either later in pregnancy (n = 2) or postnatally (n = 7) (false positive). Overall, the diagnostic accuracy in our population for the use of antenatal ultrasound to detect MCDK was 91.3%, while that reported in the existing literature was found to range from 53.3% to 100%. MCDK was isolated in the majority (71%) of cases, while in 29% of cases it was found to be associated with other renal and extrarenal fetal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Antenatal ultrasound had a diagnostic accuracy of about 91% in the prediction of postnatal MCDK and can therefore be used to guide antenatal counseling. However, prenatal or postnatal revision of the diagnosis occurred in about 7% of cases and parents should be counseled appropriately. Copyright © 2016 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0
2630,"Emergency ultrasound is performed at the point of care to answer focused clinical questions in a rapid manner. Over the last 20 years, the use of this technique has grown rapidly, and it has become a core requirement in many emergency medicine residencies and in some pediatric emergency medicine fellowships. The use of emergency ultrasound in the pediatric setting is increasing due to the lack of ionizing radiation with these studies, as compared to computed tomography. Utilizing diagnostic ultrasound in the emergency department can allow clinicians to arrive at a diagnosis at the bedside rather than sending the patient out of the department for another study. This issue focuses on common indications for diagnostic ultrasound, as found in the pediatric literature or extrapolated from adult literature where pediatric evidence is scarce. Limitations, current trends, controversies, and future directions of diagnostic ultrasound in the emergency department are also discussed.",0
2631,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that the use of 3D/4D HDLive increases the image quality in the diagnosis of benign cystic ovarian teratomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3D/HDLive ultrasound (US) was used in 31 cases of suspected ovarian cystic teratoma using vaginal 2D US. The following pathognomonic images of mature cystic teratomas were considered for diagnosis: 1) a cystic, unilocular lesion with a densely echogenic tubercle (Rokitansky nodule); 2) a diffuse or partially echogenic mass usually demonstrating sound attenuation; 3) fluid-fluid/fat-fluid levels; 4) dermoid mesh with hyperechogenic calcifications indicating the presence of bone, teeth, or other ectodermally-derived structure; 5) multiple mobile spherical structures (fat globules). RESULTS: Dermoids present a wide spectrum of images depending on the predominant tissue type. In the vast majority of cases there are dense echogenic structures that correspond to complex masses of fatty tissue, sebum, hair, epithelial remnants, along with cartilage or bone. If we catalogue all the images together, the pathognomonic of dermoid are: 1) cystic or solid cystic lesions with a Rokitansky nodule, with bone, teeth or cartilage (six cases, 22.2%); 2) a solid mass with or without attenuation that corresponds with pure sebum (five cases, 18.5%); 3) a diffuse mass with fine bands that correspond with hair inside sebum (four cases, 12.9%) and that may form meshes or plugs corresponding with a mixture of fat, sebum, and hair (three cases, 11.5%). CONCLUSIONS: HDLive U.S. provides some images of exceptional quality that enhance the definition of the structures of these tumors (fat, hair, cartilage, bone, etc.) compared to 2D/3D/4D.",0
2632,"INTRODUCTION: Small bowel atresia (SBA) is one of the most common causes of congenital intestinal obstruction. However, the accuracy of prenatal ultrasound in diagnosing this condition has not been entirely ascertained. The aim of this study was to analyse the predictive accuracy of ultrasound in detecting SBA prenatally. METHODOLOGY: Retrospective study of all cases with prenatal suspicion or postnatal confirmed SBA seen in a tertiary fetal medicine and pediatric surgery units from 2007 to 2013. Cases with duodenal atresia were excluded from the study. The predictive accuracy of ultrasound and different ultrasound signs, alone and in combination, was calculated. RESULTS: 65 fetuses with prenatal suspicion or postnatal confirmed SBA were enrolled. 58 cases had full data and were included in the analysis. Predictive accuracy of ultrasound in detecting the presence of SBA was poor, with a sensitivity of 50% (95% CI 26.0-74.0) and a specificity of 70.59% (95% CI 52.5-84.9). The presence of both bowel dilatation ≥17 mm and polyhydramnios after 32 weeks of gestation slightly increased sensitivity (66.67%, 95% CI 34.9-90.1) and specificity (80.00%, 95% CI 44.4-97.5). CONCLUSIONS: In case of suspicion of SBA before the 3rd trimester, an ultrasound after 32 weeks should be performed to confirm the presence of both polyhydramnios and bowel dilatation >17 mm.",0
2633,"Myelomeningocele (MMC) is one of the most devastating, nonlethal congenital anomalies worldwide. The live birth prevalence of MMC changed dramatically in the 1980s with the introduction of maternal serum screening and the widespread use of prenatal ultrasound imaging. The high-resolution ultrasound affordable today with state-of-the-art equipment allows us to make a very accurate diagnosis of MMC, including details related to the entire fetal central nervous system. Ultrasound can accurately localize the site of the osseous and soft tissue defects. Congenital spinal defects can be characterized definitively as open or closed, which are treated very differently with in utero repair, which is done in some cases, compared to only conservative follow-up with postnatal therapy for occult defects. Additional findings of kyphosis, scoliosis and anomalous vertebrate and associated conditions such as cervical syrinx can be identified. The state of the intracranial structures, including the presence or absence of ventriculomegaly and hindbrain herniation, as well as unexpected complications such as intracranial hemorrhage can be diagnosed. The severity of neurological compromise in some fetuses can be estimated by detailed examination of the lower extremities. As well as searching for talipes, we also now routinely characterize flexion and extension motions at the hip, knee and ankle joints. The information provided by ultrasound plays a crucial role, now more than ever, in patient counseling and pregnancy management. This article emphasizes how we utilize ultrasound in the evaluation of patients with suspected MMC at the Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.",0
2635,"PURPOSE: Exposure to diagnostic ultrasound (US) can significantly heat biological tissue although conventional routine examinations are regarded as safe. The risk of unwanted thermal effects increases with a high absorption coefficient and extended insonation time. Certain applications of transcranial diagnostic US (TC-US) require prolonged exposure. An anthropomorphic skull model (ASM) was developed to evaluate thermal effects induced by TC-US of different modalities. The objective was to determine whether prolonged continuous TC-US application results in potentially harmful temperature increases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ASM consists of a human skull with tissue mimicking material and exhibits acoustic and anatomical characteristics of the human skull and brain. Experiments are performed with a diagnostic US device testing four different US modalities: Duplex PW (pulsed wave) Doppler, PW Doppler, color flow Doppler and B-mode. Temperature changes are recorded during 180 minutes of insonation. RESULTS: All measurements revealed significant temperature increases during insonation independent of the US modality. The maximum temperature elevation of + 5.25° C (p < 0.001) was observed on the surface of the skull exposed to duplex PW Doppler. At the bone-brain border a maximum temperature increae of + 2.01 °C (p < 0.001) was noted. Temperature increases within the brain were < 1.23 °C (p = 0.001). The highest values were registered using the duplex PW Doppler modality. CONCLUSION: TC-US induces significant local heating effects in an ASM. An application duration that extends routine clinical periods causes potentially harmful heating especially in tissue close to bone. TC-US elevates the temperature in the brain mimicking tissue but is not capable of producing harmful temperature increases during routine examinations. However, the risk of thermal injury in brain tissue increases significantly after an exposure time of > 2 hours.",0
2637,"PURPOSE: To develop a new contour extraction method for identifying abnormal tissue. METHODS: We combined two techniques: logarithmic K distribution of a scattering model (method 1) and regional discrimination using the characteristics of local ultrasound images (method 2) into an integrated method (method 3) that provides accurate contours, which are essential for quantitizing border information. RESULTS: The diagnostic tissue information around the border of an image can be characterized by its shape and texture statistics. The degrees of circularity and irregularity and the depth-width ratio were calculated for the extracted contours of breast tumors. In addition, gradients, separability, and variance between the two regions along the contour and the area and variance of the internal echoes, were calculated as indices of diagnostic criteria of breast tumors. The quantitized indices were able to discriminate among cysts, fibroadenomas, and cancer. CONCLUSION: In many ultrasound images of breast tumors, the combined techniques, the variance ratio of the logarithmic K distribution to the logarithmic Rayleigh distribution and the multilevel technique with local image information can effectively extract abnormal tissue contours.",0
2638,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography in detecting and measuring free pelvic fluid. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-two patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic laparoscopy at a tertiary care center were prospectively assessed before surgery by transvaginal ultrasound. Free pelvic fluid was measured in two ultrasonographic planes. These measurements were compared to the volume of fluid aspirated during laparoscopy. RESULTS: The mean volumes reported for transvaginal ultrasound were significantly lower than those observed at laparoscopy (mean milliliters +/- SEM, 2.54 +/- 0.5 versus 9.42 +/- 1.3, P < .001). The smallest volume of free pelvic fluid that was consistently detected by ultrasound was 8 mL. Whenever no fluid or < 1 mL was detected by transvaginal ultrasound, a small volume of fluid was found at laparoscopy (mean milliliters +/- SEM, 1.6 +/- 0.47). The sensitivity of transvaginal ultrasound was 83% and specificity was 69%. CONCLUSION: Transvaginal ultrasound is a sensitive method of detecting the presence of > 8 mL of free pelvic fluid and therefore is an important diagnostic tool in the assessment of pelvic pathology associated with increased peritoneal fluid.",0
2639,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have documented the feasibility of ultrasonography (US) to diagnose acute colonic diverticulitis (ACD). This prospective observational trial determined the sonomorphology of ACD and evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of routine US performed on admission by surgeons in training. METHODS: Fifty-seven consecutive patients with a confirmed episode of ACD were entered into this study, and the sonomorphology of the involved colon was assessed. US findings were compared to the results of the clinical evaluation and correlated to the clinicopathological outcome. RESULTS: The sonomorphology of ACD was characterized by segmental inflammatory transformation of the colon averaging 9.9 +/- 3.2 cm (range, 6-20) in length and visualized as target phenomena of a mean 3.5 +/- 0.8 cm (range, 2.4-4.8) width. Targets were caused by hypoechogenic thickening of the colonic wall of an average 7.7 +/- 2. 6 mm (range, 4-18). In 40% of cases, a hyperechogenic halo representing peridiverticulitis (average width, 2.3 +/- 0.6; range, 1.2-3 cm) was noted. Diverticula were seen in almost half of the cases. Of the 57 cases with confirmed ACD, the diagnosis was made by US in 48, for a global accuracy of 84.2%. US was false negative in nine patients, suggesting perforated appendicitis in five cases and acute appendicitis in one (the final diagnoses were perforated sigmoid diverticulitis in five cases and cecal diverticulitis in one case). In three patients, US was nondiagnostic. CONCLUSION: In the hands of sonographically trained surgeons, ultrasound is a useful modality to image acute colonic diverticulitis. US reveals diagnostic sonomorphology in most cases of ACD and therefore facilitates early confirmation of the diagnosis and assessment of severity.",0
2640,"Angiogenesis is an essential condition for tumor growth. Therefore, it seems to be of interest to prove if blood flow and vascularization of breast tumors give information concerning their dignity. Consequently, 205 patients with palpable and/or mammographically detected breast tumors were examined prior to surgery by doppler sonography for blood flow in the area of the tumor. In 174 patients of this group the corresponding area of the contralateral breast was also screened by doppler ultrasound. With third doppler generation angiodynography tumors can be visualized as B-images with simultaneous information on vascularization. An integrated doppler system shows the detected blood flow in form of a doppler curve, also allowing quantification according to doppler criteria (Resistance Index RI). Blood flow detection in the tumor itself was successful in 71% of all malignancies, whereas in only 6.6% of the 76 benign lesions (n = 5) blood flow was found in the central tumor area. In the area surrounding the tumor blood flow was detected in 83% of all carcinomas, but only in 29% of benign findings. Blood flow could be detected significantly higher in malignancies than in benign lesions (p = 0.003). Blood flow detection in the tumor itself was a highly specific (93%) method of discrimination between malignant and benign breast tumors. Further quantification by means of doppler parameters only increases insignificantly specificity, quantification of blood flow in the area surrounding the tumor using the RI and the comparison with the contralateral breast could improve the diagnostic value as our findings RI < 8 for benign vs. > or = 8 for malignant lesions demonstrated. Detection of malignant tumors showed a sensitivity of 80%, a specificity of 90%, and a positive predictive value of 93%. In patients with breast cancer (histologically confirmed) the detection rate of blood flow in tumors and surrounding areas was independent of tumor size or nodal status.",0
2641,"Due to the increasing number of ultrasonographic examinations, tumors of the adrenal glands are being detected more and more often. In the present paper, suggestions for the further diagnostic evaluation are made: in the case of sonographically detected solid tumors of the adrenals, computed tomography is the next procedure of choice. If CT scan also fails to enable an unequivocal diagnosis, the next step must be laboratory investigations. Hormone-producing tumors, irrespective of size, as well as non-hormone-producing tumors larger than 6 cm in diameter or symptomatic neoplasms are all treated by surgery. In the case of an oncological patient with an asymptomatic non-hormone-producing tumor, differential diagnosis via needle aspiration should be attempted in all tumors measuring less than 6 cm in diameter. In the event of an incidental finding, fine needle aspiration is performed only in lesions measuring between 4 and 6 cm; for tumors of less than 4 cm, we consider a wait-and-see approach, with follow-up examinations at 3-month intervals to be justified.",0
2643,"The use of diagnostic ultrasound can be justified if it can be shown to provide only negligible or small risk while giving good benefit to the patient. In the absence of biological evidence, one way of assessing a new (or existing) piece of diagnostic equipment would be to predict the biophysical changes (i.e. heat and cavitation) that may be produced by its ultrasonic fields in tissue. An assessment of risk may then be made from our knowledge of thermal and cavitational biology. To this end, this study has sought to measure temperature rise, bubble formation, sonoluminescence and acoustic streaming arising from clinical transducers that have been carefully calibrated using a Beam Calibrator, and to determine whether there is good correlation between measured acoustic parameters in water and any of these biophysical characteristics. The results are inconclusive.",0
2645,"Use of a diagnostic ultrasonography unit in the placement of hepatic vein catheters is described. Diagnostic ultrasound proved to be a safe and rapid means of identifying the hepatic venous circulation. It provided a clear visual guide in an otherwise blind surgical procedure and allowed for a precise determination of catheter placement. Thus, the method could be used to advantage in other types of catheterizations. Use of ultrasonography reduced the duration of surgery by 50 to 75%, thereby minimizing the risks associated with long-term general anesthesia and reducing recovery time.",0
2646,"A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the comparative usefulness of scrotal ultrasound imaging (SU) and radionuclide scrotal imaging (RSI) in 46 patients. The final diagnosis included four late phase and one early testicular torsion (TT), 11 acute epididymitis (AE), four subacute epididymitis (SE), six malignant tumors, ten hydroceles or other cystic lesions, and ten miscellaneous lesions. In patients with scrotal pain, 3/4 with late phase TT were correctly diagnosed by SU, while one with early TT and 11/15 with AE or SE were not diagnosed. All of them were correctly diagnosed with RSI except one with scrotal cyst. SU was able to separate cystic masses (n = 10) from solid masses (n = 9), but could not separate malignant from benign lesions. RSI had difficulty in separating cystic from solid lesions. We concluded that SU is useful in patients with scrotal mass to separate solid from cystic lesions. However, SU is unable to differentiate acute epididymitis from early testicular torsion. Therefore, in patients with acute scrotal pain, RSI should still be the first study performed.",0
2647,"Described is a supervised parametric approach to the detection and classification of disease from acoustic data. Statistical pattern recognition techniques are implemented to design the best ultrasonic tissue signature from a set of measurements and for a given task, and to rate its performance in a way that can be compared with other diagnostic tools. In this paper, we considered combinations of four ultrasonic tissue parameters to discriminate, in vivo, between normal liver and chronic active hepatitis. The separation between normal and diseased samples was made by application of the Bayes decision rule for minimum risk which includes the prior probability for the presence of disease and the cost of misclassification. Large differences in classification performance of various tissue parameter combinations were demonstrated using the Hotelling trace criterion (HTC) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The ability of additional measurements to increase or decrease discriminability, even measurements from other diagnostic modalities, can be evaluated directly in this manner.",0
2649,"In four patients, intra-abdominal abscesses were identified by ultrasonic technique: a right lower quadrant abscess in Crohn disease, a pyogenic liver abscess, a pelvic abscess following rejection and removal of a transplanted kidney, and a perinephric abscess. In all four the establishment by ultrasound that the mass was filled with fluid was critical in guiding drainage. Diagnostic ultrasound is a safe and effective means for the detection, localization, and characterization of retroperitoneal, intraperitoneal, or intraparenchymal inflammatory masses.",0
2652,"INTRODUCTION: Endotracheal intubation is commonly performed in the Emergency Department. Traditional measures for estimating and confirming the endotracheal tube (ETT) depth may be inaccurate or lead to delayed recognition. Ultrasound may offer a rapid tool to confirm ETT depth at the bedside. METHODS: This was a randomized trial assessing the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound to confirm ETT depth. Three cadavers were intubated in a random sequence with the ETT placed high (directly below the vocal cords), middle (2 cm above the carina), or deep (ETT at the carina). Seven blinded sonographers assessed the depth of the ETT using ultrasound. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy of sonographer identification, time to identification, and operator confidence based upon ETT location. A subgroup analysis was performed to assess diagnostic accuracy by operator confidence. RESULTS: 441 total assessments were performed (154 high, 154 middle, and 133 deep ETT placements). Overall accuracy was 84.8% (95% CI 81.1% to 88.0%). When placed high, ultrasound was 82.5% sensitive (95% CI 75.5% to 88.1%) and 92.3% specific (95% CI 88.6% to 95.1%) with a mean time to identification of 15.3 s (95% CI 13.6-17.0) and a mean operator confidence of 3.9/5.0 (95% CI 3.7-4.1). When the ETT was placed in the middle, ultrasound was 83.8% sensitive (95% CI 77.0% to 89.2%) and 92.3% specific (95% CI 88.6% to 95.1%) with a mean time to identification of 16.7 s (95% CI 14.6-18.8) and a mean operator confidence of 3.7/5.0 (95% CI 3.5-3.9). When the ETT was placed deep, ultrasound was 88.0% sensitive (95% CI 81.2% to 93.0%) and 92.2% specific (95% CI 88.6% to 94.6%) with a mean time to identification of 19.0 s (95% CI 17.3-20.7) and a mean operator confidence of 3.4/5.0 (95% CI 3.2-3.6). Sonographers were significantly more accurate when they reported a higher confidence score. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound was moderately accurate for identifying the ETT location in a cadaveric model and was more accurate when sonographers felt confident with their visualization. Future research should determine the accuracy of combining transtracheal ultrasound with lung sliding and other modifications to improve the accuracy.",0
2653,"OBJECTIVES: To provide a graded diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions in the parotid gland by conventional ultrasound, and thus to predict the probability of malignancy of the lesions. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of conventional ultrasound images of 150 patients with parotid lesions by two observers. Parotid lesions were classified into seven patterns and then categorised into eight grades: Grade 0, unsatisfied illustration on ultrasound; Grade 1, normal parotid gland; Grade 2, definitively benign; Grade 3, probably benign; Grade 4, indeterminate; Grade 5, probably malignant; Grade 6, highly suggestive malignant and Grade 7, already had malignant diagnosis. Combined with the pathological results, the conventional ultrasound diagnostic grade of parotid lesions was evaluated for predicting the probability of malignancy. RESULTS: There was excellent interobserver agreement of both readers for patterns and grades (K = 0.89 and 0.90, p < 0.01). The proportions of the malignancies in conventional ultrasound Grade 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 according to the two readers 0 and 0, 0 and 0, 8.7% and 8.8%, 54.2% and 50%, 100% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and area under ROC curve were 64.0%, 91.2%, 0.809 and 64.0%, 89.6%, 0.802, respectively, using Grade 5 of the two readers as the best grade for diagnosing benign and malignant parotid lesions. CONCLUSION: The conventional ultrasound diagnostic grade of parotid lesions can be used to evaluate the risk of malignancy and will be helpful to improve the imaging diagnosis and clinical treatment.",0
2655,"BACKGROUND: Ultrasound (US) guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of thyroid are examined and reported by cytopathologists based usually on The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BTC) regardless of the procedure's performers. This study is designed to determine whether there is any performer-dependent difference. METHODS: Six hundred and fifty-one thyroid US-FNAs in correlation with surgical follow-up (SFU) were studied. The statistical analysis was performed using the surgical pathology diagnosis as the gold standard. RESULTS: Among the 283 cases performed by cytopathologists, there were 8 (2.8%) nondiagnostic (BTC I), 197 (69.6%) benign (BTC II), 31 (11%) atypical (BTC III), 14 (5%) suspicious for follicular neoplasm (BTC IV), 12 (4.2%) suspicious for malignancy (BTC V), and 21 (7.4%) positive for malignancy (BTC VI), and there were 55 (19.4%) cases with SFU. The 368 cases performed by others showed 76 (21%) BTC I, 238 (65%) BTC II, 26 (7%) BTC III, 10 (3%) BTC IV, 9 (2.5%) BTC V 5, and 9 (2.5%) BTC VI, and there were 26 (7%) cases with SFU. The cytopathologist group achieved better sensitivity (91.3 vs.78%); slightly better specificity (83.3 vs. 82%); better positive predictive value (87.5 vs. 70%); similar negative predictive value (88.2 vs. 88%); and better overall accuracy (87.8 vs. 81%) compared with the non-cytopathologist group. Overall the difference for all statistical values is significant different (P = 0.041). CONCLUSION: US-FNA performed by cytopathologists showed a lower unsatisfactory rate and significantly better overall statistical values. Cytopathologists may play an important role in thyroid patient care. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2016;44:787-791. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0
2656,"Emergency ultrasound is performed at the point of care to answer focused clinical questions in a rapid manner. Over the last 20 years, the use of this technique has grown rapidly, and it has become a core requirement in many emergency medicine residencies and in some pediatric emergency medicine fellowships. The use of emergency ultrasound in the pediatric setting is increasing due to the lack of ionizing radiation with these studies, as compared to computed tomography. Utilizing diagnostic ultrasound in the emergency department can allow clinicians to arrive at a diagnosis at the bedside rather than sending the patient out of the department for another study. This issue focuses on common indications for diagnostic ultrasound, as found in the pediatric literature or extrapolated from adult literature where pediatric evidence is scarce. Limitations, current trends, controversies, and future directions of diagnostic ultrasound in the emergency department are also discussed.",0
2657,"BACKGROUND: In stable patients with blunt abdominal trauma, accurate diagnosis of visceral injuries is crucial. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether repeating ultrasound exam will increase the sensitivity of focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) through revealing additional free intraperitoneal fluid in patients with blunt abdominal trauma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study by performing primary and secondary ultrasound exams in blunt abdominal trauma patients. All ultrasound exams were performed by four radiology residents who had the experience of more than 400 FAST exams. Five routine intraperitoneal spaces as well as the interloop space were examined by ultrasound in order to find free fluid. All patients who expired or were transferred to the operating room before the second exam were excluded from the study. All positive ultrasound results were compared with intra-operative and computed tomography (CT) findings and/or the clinical status of the patients. RESULTS: Primary ultrasound was performed in 372 patients; 61 of them did not undergo secondary ultrasound exam; thus, were excluded from the study.Three hundred eleven patients underwent both primary and secondary ultrasound exams. One hundred and two of all patients were evaluated by contrast enhanced CT scan and 31 underwent laparotomy. The sensitivity of ultrasound exam in detecting intraperitoneal fluid significantly increased from 70.7% for the primary exam to 92.7% for the secondary exam. Examining the interloop space significantly improved the sensitivity of ultrasonography in both primary (from 36.6% to 70.7%) and secondary (from 65.9% to 92.7%) exams. CONCLUSIONS: Performing a secondary ultrasound exam in stable blunt abdominal trauma patients and adding interloop space scan to the routine FAST exam significantly increases the sensitivity of ultrasound in detecting intraperitoneal free fluid.",0
2660,"Improvements in ultrasound (US) resolution have led to the application of this non-ionizing imaging modality in the diagnosis of soft tissue disorders affecting the head and neck region. Although operator experience is paramount in image interpretation, US has the advantage of being inexpensive, safe and widely available. Ultrasound is the first line imaging modality for suspected salivary gland tumours and is useful in evaluating superficial neck swellings, such as lymph node disease, soft tissue cysts and vascular malformations. Ultrasound also improves the success rate when used for guidance during fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This paper aims to provide the general practitioner with an overview of the basic principles of image formation, the advantages and disadvantages of US, and an outline of its indications for conditions that might present to the dental practitioner.",0
2661,"PURPOSE: We tested whether transverse rectal diameter measured by ultrasound could identify rectal impaction, investigated whether transverse diameter is enlarged in constipated children compared to healthy children and evaluated transverse diameter during treatment of constipation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 51 children 4 to 12 years old were included in the study. Of the children 27 (mean age 7.0 +/- 1.8 years) had been diagnosed with chronic constipation by Rome III criteria and 24 (9.1 +/- 2.7 years) were healthy controls. All patients underwent a thorough medical history and physical examination, including digital rectal examination and measurement of rectal diameter by transabdominal ultrasound. Constipated children underwent repeat investigations after 4 weeks of laxative treatment. RESULTS: Average rectal diameter of children with negative digital rectal examination was 21 +/- 4.2 mm (mean +/- SD), leading to the approximation that a value greater than 29.4 mm (mean +/- 2 SD) indicates rectal impaction. All children with rectal impaction identified by digital examination had a rectal diameter larger than 29.4 mm. Moreover, constipated children had a significantly larger rectal diameter (42.1 +/- 15.4 mm) than healthy children (21.4 +/- 6.0 mm, p <0.001). After 4 weeks of laxative treatment constipated children had a significant reduction in rectal diameter (mean 26.9 +/- 5.6 mm, p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Transverse rectal diameter seems to be a valuable tool to identify rectal impaction and may replace digital rectal examination. Constipated children have a significantly larger rectal diameter compared to healthy children, and when constipation is treated the diameter is reduced significantly.",0
2662,"Freehand 3D ultrasound systems acquire sets of B-Mode ultrasound images tagged with position information obtained by a tracking device. For both further processing and clinical use of these ultrasound slice images scattered in space, it is often required to reconstruct them into 3D-rectilinear grid arrays. We propose new efficient methods for this so-called ultrasound spatial compounding using a backward-warping paradigm. They allow to establish 3D-volumes from any scattered freehand ultrasound data with superior quality / speed properties with respect to existing methods. In addition, arbitrary MPR slices can be reconstructed directly from the freehand ultrasound slice set, without the need of an extra volumetric reconstruction step. We qualitatively assess the reconstruction quality and quantitatively compare our compounding method to other algorithms using ultrasound data of the neck and liver. The usefulness of direct MPR reconstruction for multimodal image registration is demonstrated as well.",0
2663,"The aim of this study was the validation of the minimal Resistance Index (min RI) measured by colour Doppler sonography as parameter of tumour neoangiogenesis. 107 patients with clinically or radiologically diagnosed breast tumour with a sonographically detectable lump had preoperative measurements and analysis of blood flow in the tumour area and in the healthy parenchyma of both breasts. The min RI was compared with histology, menopausal status and age. In all 107 patients blood flow could be measured in the tumour area and in 98% of the bilaterally investigated quadrants. Irrespective of tumour status the mean min RI was lower in the tumour area (0.62) than in the other quadrants of the affected (RI = 0.65, p = 0.002) or contralateral breast (RI = 0.65, p = 0.0003). The mean min RI of benign tumours was 0.60 (+/- 0.11 SD) and of malignant tumours 0.64 (+/- 0.11 SD), this difference was not significant (p = 0.07). Irrespective of tumour status postmenopausal patients had a higher mean min RI than premenopausal patients. This was true for the tumour area (RI = 0.64 vs 0.60, p = 0.11) and also for the quadrants (RI = 0.68 vs 0.62, p = 0.0002). In postmenopausal women there was a statistically significant correlation with age (r = 0.58, p = 0.0001). We conclude that the min RI is of no diagnostic relevance for the classification of breast tumours as benign or malignant.",0

2666,Diagnostic ultrasound is a very useful method in the field of space occupying les sions of the kidneys.

The sonographic criteria for tumors are described.,0
2670,"PURPOSE: An inevitable feature of ultrasound-based diagnoses is that the quality of the ultrasound images produced depends directly on the skill of the physician operating the probe. This is because physicians have to constantly adjust the probe position to obtain a cross section of the target organ, which is constantly shifting due to patient respiratory motions. Therefore, we developed an ultrasound diagnostic robot that works in cooperation with a visual servo system based on deep learning that will help alleviate the burdens imposed on physicians. METHODS: Our newly developed robotic ultrasound diagnostic system consists of three robots: an organ tracking robot (OTR), a robotic bed, and a robotic supporting arm. Additionally, we used different image processing methods (YOLOv5s and BiSeNet V2) to detect the target kidney location, as well as to evaluate the appropriateness of the obtained ultrasound images (ResNet 50). Ultimately, the image processing results are transmitted to the OTR for use as motion commands. RESULTS: In our experiments, the highest effective tracking rate (0.749) was obtained by YOLOv5s with Kalman filtering, while the effective tracking rate was improved by about 37% in comparison with cases without such filtering. Additionally, the appropriateness probability of the ultrasound images obtained during the tracking process was also the highest and most stable. The second highest tracking efficiency value (0.694) was obtained by BiSeNet V2 with Kalman filtering and was a 75% improvement over the case without such filtering. CONCLUSION: While the most efficient tracking achieved is based on the combination of YOLOv5s and Kalman filtering, the combination of BiSeNet V2 and Kalman filtering was capable of detecting the kidney center of gravity closer to the kidney's actual motion state. Furthermore, this model could also measure the cross-sectional area, maximum diameter, and other detailed information of the target kidney, which meant it is more practical for use in actual diagnoses.",0
2671,"BACKGROUND: The use of imaging to diagnose patellofemoral instability is often limited by the inability to dynamically load the joint during assessment. Therefore, the diagnosis is typically based on physical examination using the glide test to assess and quantify lateral patellar translation.

PURPOSE: To quantify patellar position using ultrasound imaging under dynamic loading conditions to distinguish between knees with and without medial patellofemoral complex (MPFC) injury.

METHODS: In 10 cadaveric knees, the medial patellofemoral distance was measured to quantify patellar position from 0° to 40° of knee flexion at 10° increments. Knees were evaluated at each flexion angle under unloaded conditions and with 20 N of laterally directed force on the patella to mimic the glide test. Patellar position measurements were made on ultrasound images obtained before and after MPFC transection and compared for significant differences. To determine the ability of medial patellofemoral measurements to differentiate between MPFC-intact and MPFC-deficient states, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and the Delong test were used. The optimal cutoff value to distinguish between the deficient and intact states was determined using the Youden J statistic. RESULTS: A significant increase in medial patellofemoral distance was observed in the MPFC-deficient state as compared with the intact state at all flexion angles (P = .005 to P < .001). When compared with the intact state, MPFC deficiency increased medial patellofemoral distance by 32.8% (6 mm) at 20° of knee flexion under 20-N load. Based on ROC analysis and the J statistic, the optimal threshold for identifying MPFC injury was 19.2 mm of medial patellofemoral distance at 20° of flexion under dynamic loading conditions (area under the ROC curve = 0.93, sensitivity = 77.8%, specificity = 100%, accuracy = 88.9%). CONCLUSION: Using dynamic ultrasound assessment, we found that medial patellofemoral distance significantly increases with disruption of the MPFC. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dynamic ultrasound measurements can be used to accurately detect the presence of complete MPFC injury.",0
2672,"INTRODUCTION: Ultrasound is an extension of the clinical examination and its findings should be correlated with the clinical picture as a whole to be useful. Hereby, we report a unique negative diagnostic ultrasound finding in blunt abdominal trauma which was not reported before. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old obese man presented complaining of severe generalized abdominal pain and inability to pass urine of three days duration after he slipped on his abdomen. The abdomen was distended and tender all over. There was no blood on the urethral meatus. FAST scan showed significant intra-peritoneal fluid. The urinary bladder could not be seen. A Foley catheter was inserted which drained 3 L of clear urine. The abdominal distention became less. Repeated FAST scan was completely negative. A clinical diagnosis of major intra-peritoneal rupture of the urinary bladder was made. Trauma CT scan and laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The change of a positive FAST to a negative FAST was diagnostic of a major intra-peritoneal urinary bladder rupture even before performing a trauma CT scan. When performing FAST in blunt abdominal trauma, it is more useful to perform FAST before inserting a urinary catheter and it is advised to repeat it.",0
2674,"We review the literature on diagnostic point-of-care ultrasound applications most relevant to hospital medicine and highlight gaps in the evidence base. Diagnostic point-of-care applications most relevant to hospitalists include cardiac ultrasound for left ventricular systolic function, pericardial effusion, and severe mitral regurgitation; lung ultrasound for pneumonia, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and pulmonary edema; abdominal ultrasound for ascites, aortic aneurysm, and hydronephrosis; and venous ultrasound for central venous volume assessment and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. Hospitalists and other frontline providers, as well as physician trainees at various levels of training, have moderate to excellent diagnostic accuracy after brief training programs for most of these applications. Despite the evidence supporting the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound, experimental evidence supporting its clinical use by hospitalists is limited to cardiac ultrasound.",0
2675,"INTRODUCTION: This study analyses the diagnostic value of ultrasonography (US) detection for calcification in thyroid nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed the preoperative US findings and clinical characteristics of 577 malignant and 3434 benign thyroid patients who underwent surgery in our hospital. RESULTS: The malignant rate in patients with microcalcification hyperechoic and tiny calcification foci ≤2 mm in diameter was significantly higher than the non-calcification and other calcification group (P <0.001). The malignant rate in single calcifi cation nodule was signifi cantly higher than that in multiple nodule group (P <0.01). Most of the patients (37/39) with lymph node calcification were malignant. The malignant rate of calcification and microcalcification was significantly higher in patients <45 years old than in older patients (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with other calcifications, microcalcification should be a better predictor of thyroid carcinoma. Malignancy should be highly suspected in patients with single calcification nodule, especially with lymph node calcification. Patients younger than 45 years of age with calcification or microcalcification have a greater risk for thyroid carcinoma.",0
2676,"INTRODUCTION: Neuromuscular ultrasound (NMUS), an emerging diagnostic subspecialty field, has become an important extension of the electrodiagnostic examination. However, there are no formal guidelines on how to appropriately report NMUS results. METHODS: The AANEM convened an expert panel to develop recommendations for reporting NMUS findings. RESULTS: Providers should describe the reason for referral, the nerves or muscles studied, and normal values as well as numerical values for the results of imaging. Muscle imaging reports should also include a description of how gray-scale values were calculated. NMUS-guided needle placement reports should include a description of the length and gauge of needle, the type of probe used, and an indication of how well the patient tolerated the procedure. All reports should clearly state whether the findings were normal or abnormal and include a definitive diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: NMUS reports should provide comprehensive information along with a succinct conclusion, mirroring guidelines for electrodiagnostic reports.",0
2677,"PURPOSE: Diagnosing appendicitis may require adjunct studies such as computed tomography or ultrasound (US). Combining a clinical examination with surgeon-performed US (SPUS) may increase diagnostic accuracy and decrease radiation exposure and costs. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted including children with a potential diagnosis of appendicitis. A surgery resident performed a clinical examination and US to make a diagnosis. Final diagnosis of appendicitis was confirmed by operative findings and pathology. Results were compared with radiology department US (RDUS) and a large randomized trial. Analysis was performed using Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were evaluated and underwent SPUS. Twenty-nine patients (54%) had appendicitis. Overall accuracy was 89%, with accuracy increasing from 85% to 93% between the 2 halves of the study. Radiology department US was performed on 21 patients before surgical evaluation, yielding an accuracy of 81%. Surgeon-performed US on those 21 patients yielded an accuracy of 90%. No statistical differences were found between any groups (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Accuracy of SPUS was similar to RDUS and that of a large prospective randomized trial performed by radiologists. Furthermore, when the same clinician performs the clinical examination and US, a high level of accuracy can be achieved. With this degree of accuracy, SPUS may be used as a primary diagnostic tool and computed tomography reserved for challenging cases, limiting costs, and radiation exposure.",0
2678,"BACKGROUND: Use of CT in the evaluation of suspected appendicitis in children is common. Expanding the use of US would eliminate the radiation exposure associated with CT. OBJECTIVE: We describe new criteria that improve US's diagnostic accuracy for appendicitis, making it more comparable to CT in terms of sensitivity and specificity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 304 consecutive patients undergoing US for the diagnosis of appendicitis in our institution during 2006. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the maximal outer diameter (MOD) at various measurements was calculated and compared to pathology results. Additional variables (appendiceal wall thickness, fecalith, hyperemia, fat stranding, free fluid, age and weight) were also evaluated. RESULTS: The highest sensitivity (98.7%) and specificity (95.4%) were identified when MOD was ≥7 mm or wall thickness was >1.7 mm. These values resulted in correctly classifying 96.6% of cases, with 1 (0.5%) false-negative and 6 (2.9%) false-positive studies. Incorporating secondary signs of appendicitis, age or weight did not alter accuracy. CONCLUSION: These findings identify new US criteria that compare favorably to CT. In children with suspected appendicitis, using US as the initial imaging study will ultimately lead to improved accuracy, lower cost and the elimination of ionizing radiation exposure.",0
2681,"Activities in the standardisation of medical ultrasonic imaging and monitoring devices have been undertaken to ensure the safe application and to provide the user with tools to perform risk-to-benefit analysis. Internationally, agreement has not been reached to implement a system based on a physical quantity such as temperature rise. Therefore, recently, the IEC Standard 60601-2-37 has adopted the thermal index (TI) as a safety parameter. TI indicates conditions that are more likely than others to produce thermal effects. The models used to calculate TI are based on the equilibrium temperature rise for a stationary transducer. Ultrasound (US) is often applied during a short time at one place. To characterise the situation before equilibrium is reached, this study proposes a new parameter: TT (time to threshold). TT indicates the time after which a threshold temperature rise is exceeded. TT is calculated for some tissue models to illustrate the meaning of TT. TT indicates how long one piece of tissue can be insonated safely, provided the safe threshold is known. Using TT, higher intensities can be applied safely during a limited time. This paper illustrates the effects of short insonation times and the influence of the beam diameter. Questions that are critical to the introduction of TT as a safety parameter are discussed.",0
2683,"Acute appendicitis is one of the most common abdominal surgical emergencies in North America. Although the treatment of appendicitis has remained the same for over 250 years, diagnostic techniques have changed immensely. Most recently, graded compression ultrasonography has received much support. In an attempt to determine whether ultrasonography has improved the outcome in acute appendicitis, we retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients undergoing appendectomy and/or ultrasound for suspected appendicitis during two separate 12-month periods. We began using ultrasound in the diagnosis of appendicitis in 1987; therefore, 1986 was used as our pre-ultrasound year; 1989 was used as our comparison year because ultrasound had become widely applied in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis by this time. Data was tabulated on all patients undergoing appendectomy in both study years, as well as those also undergoing ultrasonography in 1989. The populations in 1986 and 1989 were similar for all data tabulated. The diagnostic accuracy rate actually decreased after the implementation of ultrasonography (85.6% vs 77.0%, P < 0.05). This trend was seen in both male and female patients, reaching statistical significance in the male population (P < 0.05). The incidence of perforation and complications were not statistically decreased after the implementation of ultrasound. Ultrasound did not decrease the length of hospital stay, and in addition added approximately $48,000 to the treatment cost of appendicitis in 1989. Thus, despite adding cost, ultrasonography for appendicitis did not improve our ability to diagnose or accurately treat appendicitis.",0

2688,"BACKGROUND: The use of ultrasound to diagnose appendicitis in children is well-documented but not universally employed outside of pediatric academic centers, especially in the United States. Various obstacles make it difficult for institutions and radiologists to abandon a successful and accurate CT-based imaging protocol in favor of a US-based protocol. OBJECTIVE: To describe how we overcame barriers to implementing a US-based appendicitis protocol among a large group of nonacademic private-practice pediatric radiologists while maintaining diagnostic accuracy and decreasing medical costs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of physicians (pediatric surgery, pediatric emergency medicine and pediatric radiology) approved an imaging protocol using US as the primary modality to evaluate suspected appendicitis with CT for equivocal cases. The protocol addressed potential bias against US and accommodated for institutional limitations of radiologist and sonographer experience and availability. Radiologists coded US reports according to the probability of appendicitis. Radiology reports were compared with clinical outcomes to assess diagnostic accuracy. During the study period, physicians from each group were apprised of the interim US protocol accuracy results. Problematic cases were discussed openly. RESULTS: A total of 512 children were enrolled and underwent US for evaluation of appendicitis over a 30-month period. Diagnostic accuracy was comparable to published results for combined US/CT protocols. Comparing the first 12 months to the last 12 months of the study period, the proportion of children achieving an unequivocal US result increased from 30% (51/169) to 53% (149/282) and the proportion of children undergoing surgery based solely on US findings increased from 55% (23/42) to 84% (92/109). Overall, 63% (325/512) of patients in the protocol did not require a CT. Total patient costs were reduced by $30,182 annually. CONCLUSION: We overcame several barriers to implementing a US protocol. During the study period our ability to visualize the appendix with US increased and utilization of CT decreased. Our overall diagnostic accuracy with the US-based protocol was comparable to other published results and remained unchanged throughout the study.",0
2690,"The paper touches upon the specific features of the structure of orbital formations, by considering their anatomic topography and biophysical properties. By studying the results of investigations of the morphological and biophysical studies of orbital tissues, the authors analyze their features and compare their relationships. These results unraveling each of the considered orbital anatomic elements from the acoustic profile ranges may be useful in understanding the nature of clinical changes, which will be able to interpret these or those diagnostic signs--guides and to trace their evolution. In addition, this approach can help interpret the texture of an ultrasound digital image of eye socket soft tissue and permit one to look at pathological clinical manifestations from the so-called biophysical essence. This will allow additional information to be gleaned, by analyzing the usual signs.",0
2691,"Musculoskeletal ultrasound involves the use of high-frequency sound waves to image soft tissues and bony structures in the body for the purposes of diagnosing pathology or guiding real-time interventional procedures. Recently, an increasing number of physicians have integrated musculoskeletal ultrasound into their practices to facilitate patient care. Technological advancements, improved portability, and reduced costs continue to drive the proliferation of ultrasound in clinical medicine. This increased interest creates a need for education pertaining to all aspects of musculoskeletal ultrasound. The primary purpose of this article is to review diagnostic ultrasound technology and its potential clinical applications in the evaluation and treatment of patients with neurologic and musculoskeletal disorders. After reviewing this article, physicians should be able to (1) list the advantages and disadvantages of ultrasound compared with other available imaging modalities, (2) describe how ultrasound machines produce images using sound waves, (3) discuss the steps necessary to acquire and optimize an ultrasound image, (4) understand the different ultrasound appearances of tendons, nerves, muscles, ligaments, blood vessels, and bones, and (5) identify multiple applications for diagnostic and interventional musculoskeletal ultrasound in musculoskeletal practice. Part 1 of this 2-part article reviews the fundamentals of clinical ultrasonographic imaging, including relevant physics, equipment, training, image optimization, and scanning principles for diagnostic and interventional purposes.",0
2692,"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the findings and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in antero-lateral ankle impingement (ALI) with clinical and arthroscopic correlation. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Seventeen elite footballers with chronic ankle pain were referred for ultrasound with a clinical diagnosis of ALI (n = 8) or a control condition (n = 9; lateral mechanical instability, osteochondral defect, intra-articular bodies and osteoarthritis). Ultrasound examination included the antero-lateral gutter for abnormal synovial tissue (synovitic lesion), lateral ligament integrity, tibiotalar joint and osseous spurs of the distal tibia and talus. Ultrasound findings were correlated with subsequent arthroscopic appearance. RESULTS: Ultrasound examination detected a synovitic mass in the antero-lateral gutter in all 8 footballers with clinical ALI (100%) and in 2 patients with a control diagnosis (22%). Arthroscopic correlation of antero-lateral synovitis and fibrosis was present in all 10 cases (100%). The synovitic lesion was seen at ultrasound as a nodular soft tissue mass of mixed echogenicity within the antero-lateral gutter, which extruded anteriorly with manual compression of the distal fibula against the tibia. Increased blood supply was detected using power Doppler imaging in only 1 patient. The synovitic lesion measured >10 mm in its maximum dimension in 7 footballers with clinical ALI and <10 mm in the control group. Additional ultrasound findings in patients with abnormal antero-lateral synovial tissue included an anterior talofibular ligament injury in all patients (n = 10), a tibiotalar joint effusion (n = 6) and osseous spurs (n = 4). Antero-lateral synovitic tissue was accurately identified at ultrasound in the absence of an effusion (n = 4). No synovitic lesion was detected at ultrasound or arthroscopy in the remaining 7 patients with a control diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound is accurate in detecting synovitic lesions within the antero-lateral gutter, demonstrating associated ligamentous injuries and in differentiating soft tissue from osseous impingement. Synovitic lesions in two control patients suggest that abnormal antero-lateral soft tissue does not necessarily imply the presence of symptomatic ALI. Synovitic lesions in excess of 10 mm were associated with symptoms. Ultrasound will not demonstrate osteocartilaginous lesions or stress fractures and may overlook some loose bodies. Ultrasound findings together with clinical correlation can be used to direct arthroscopic examination and surgical debridement.",0
2693,"A 44-year-old woman was admitted with obvious symptoms of hypoglycemia and Whipple's triad during a 6-month period. The glucose level was as low as 32 mg/dL and insulin/glucose ratio greater than 0.5 after fasting. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies revealed a pancreatic mass at the head, 2 cm in diameter that was not suggesting because of hypointensity. Selective angiography and somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy did not reveal insulinoma. During laparotomy the tumor was palpated on the ventral surface of pancreas and intraoperative ultrasound accurately localized it. Doppler ultrasound examination clearly revealed the hypervascularity of the tumor, which was suggesting an insulinoma. After the tumor enucleation, blood glucose level increased to normal ranges. Histopathological examination revealed benign, well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, insulinoma. The postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient is still symptom free during a follow-up period of 6 months. Doppler ultrasound may be a simple but efficient tool for the differential diagnosis of insulinoma. If the clinical symptoms and findings suggest clearly an insulinoma, intraoperative Doppler ultrasound examination seems to be a simple but the most sensitive diagnostic method.",0
2694,"Renovascular hypertension (RVH) accounts for 5-25% cases of secondary hypertension in children. It is the second most frequent cause of hypertension (second only to aortic coarctation), potentially treatable, provided that early diagnosis is made and no permanent organic lesions develop. No clinical symptoms are observed in more than 60% children with renovascular hypertension; hypertension itself is diagnosed incidentally, in routine checkups. The patient is often hospitalised only after organic complications. The study aim was to verify the value of Doppler examination in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in children. In 2001, four out of 18 patients of the Nephrology Department examined due to hypertension were diagnosed with renovascular hypertension. In three of them, examination demonstrated aneurysmatic widening of renal artery with multiple stenoses, renal artery trunk stenosis, significant stenosis in abdominal aorta and in both renal arteries. In another case, stenosis of an additional renal artery was observed. All diagnoses were made with Doppler ultrasound and confirmed by angiography. Colour and spectral Doppler ultrasound examination is a non-invasive and valuable method of diagnosing hypertension in children.",0
