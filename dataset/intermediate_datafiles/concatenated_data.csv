"We investigated the effect of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) on gene expression related to alcohol dependence and histological effects on brain tissue. We also aimed at determining the miRNA-mRNA relationship and their pathways in alcohol dependence-induced expression changes after focused ultrasound therapy. We designed a case-control study for 100 days of observation to investigate differences in gene expression in the short-term stimulation group (STS) and long-term stimulation group (LTS) compared with the control sham group (SG). The study was performed in our Experimental Research Laboratory. 24 male high alcohol-preferring rats 63 to 79 days old, weighing 270 to 300 g, were included in the experiment. LTS received 50-day LIFU and STS received 10-day LIFU and 40-day sham stimulation, while the SG received 50-day sham stimulation. In miRNA expression analysis, it was found that LIFU caused gene expression differences in NAc. Significant differences were found between the groups for gene expression. Compared to the SG, the expression of 454 genes in the NAc region was changed in the STS while the expression of 382 genes was changed in the LTS. In the LTS, the expression of 32 genes was changed in total compared to STS. Our data suggest that LIFU targeted on NAc may assist in the treatment of alcohol dependence, especially in the long term possibly through altering gene expression. Our immunohistochemical studies verified that LIFU does not cause any tissue damage. These findings may lead to new studies in investigating the efficacy of LIFU for the treatment of alcohol dependence and also for other psychiatric disorders.",1
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain but is also an important obstacle for the effective delivery of therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been shown to reversibly disrupt the BBB. However, treatment of diffuse regions across the brain along with the effect on Alzheimer's disease relevant pathology need to be better characterized. This study is an open-labelled single-arm trial (NCT04118764) to investigate the feasibility of modulating BBB permeability in the default mode network and the impact on cognition, amyloid and tau pathology as well as BBB integrity. Nine participants [mean age 70.2 ± 7.2 years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 21.9] underwent three biweekly procedures with follow-up visits up to 6 months. The BBB permeability of the bilateral hippocampi, anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus was transiently increased without grade 3 or higher adverse events. Participants did not experience worsening trajectory of cognitive decline (ADAS-cog11, MMSE). Whole brain vertex-based analysis of the 18F-florbetaben PET imaging demonstrated clusters of modest SUVR reduction in the right parahippocampal and inferior temporal lobe. However, CSF and blood biomarkers did not demonstrate any amelioration of Alzheimer's disease pathology (P-tau181, amyloid-β42/40 ratio), nor did it show persistent BBB dysfunction (plasma PDGFRbeta and CSF-to-plasma albumin ratio). This study provides neuroimaging and fluid biomarker data to characterize the safety profile of MRgFUS BBB modulation in neurodegeneration as a potential strategy for enhanced therapeutic delivery.",1
"OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, including agitation and aggressive behavior. These symptoms increase with disease severity, ranging from 10% in mild cognitive impairment to 50% in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, pose a great risk for self-injury and injury to caregivers, result in high rates of institutionalization and great suffering for patients and families. Current pharmacological therapies have limited efficacy and a high potential for severe side effects. Thus, there is a growing need to develop novel therapeutics tailored to safely and effectively reduce agitation and aggressive behavior in AD. Here, we investigate for the first time the use of focused ultrasound combined with anesthetic-loaded nanodroplets (nanoFUS) targeting the amygdala (key structure in the neurocircuitry of agitation) as a novel minimally invasive tool to modulate local neural activity and reduce agitation and aggressive behavior in the TgCRND8 AD transgenic mice. METHODS: Male and female animals were tested in the resident-intruder (i.e., aggressive behavior) and open-field tests (i.e., motor agitation) for baseline measures, followed by treatment with active- or sham-nanoFUS. Behavioral testing was then repeated after treatment. RESULTS: Active-nanoFUS neuromodulation reduced aggressive behavior and agitation in male mice, as compared to sham-treated controls. Treatment with active-nanoFUS increased the time male mice spent in social-non-aggressive behaviors. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that neuromodulation with active-nanoFUS may be a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms, with special focus on agitation and aggressive behaviors. Further studies are necessary to establish cellular, molecular and long-term behavioral changes following treatment with nanoFUS.",1
"Background Neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer disease) characterized by the deposition of various pathogenic forms of tau protein in the brain are collectively referred to as tauopathies. Identification of the molecular drivers and pathways of neurodegeneration is critical to individualized targeted treatment of these disorders. However, despite important advances in fluid biomarker detection, characterization of these molecular subtypes is limited by the blood-brain barrier. Purpose To evaluate the feasibility and safety of focused ultrasound-mediated liquid biopsy (sonobiopsy) in the detection of brain-derived protein biomarkers in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy (PS19 mice). Materials and Methods Sonobiopsy was performed by sonicating the cerebral hemisphere in 2-month-old PS19 and wild-type mice, followed by measurement of plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species (30 minutes after sonication in the sonobiopsy group). Next, spatially targeted sonobiopsy was performed by sonicating either the cerebral cortex or the hippocampus in 6-month-old PS19 mice. To detect changes in plasma neurofilament light chain (a biomarker of neurodegeneration) levels, blood samples were collected before and after sonication (15 and 45-60 minutes after sonication). Histologic staining was performed to evaluate tissue damage after sonobiopsy. The Shapiro-Wilk test, unpaired and paired t tests, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used. Results In the 2-month-old mice, sonobiopsy significantly increased the normalized levels of plasma p-tau species compared with the conventional blood-based liquid biopsy (p-tau-181-to-mouse tau [m-tau] ratio: 1.7-fold increase, P = .006; p-tau-231-to-m-tau ratio: 1.4-fold increase, P = .048). In the 6-month-old PS19 mice, spatially targeted sonobiopsy resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in plasma neurofilament light chain after sonication of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (P < .001). After optimization of the sonobiopsy parameters, no excess microhemorrhage was observed in the treated cerebral hemisphere compared with the contralateral side. Conclusion This study showed the feasibility of sonobiopsy to release phosphorylated tau species and neurofilament light chain to the blood circulation, potentially facilitating diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

"BACKGROUND: Coronary microthromboembolism after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) requires urgent and effective treatment. Early and effective recovery of coronary microcirculation perfusion for the management of AMI would be crucial for better prognosis. Ultrasound assisted thrombolysis in the in-vitro experiments have great potential for the elimination of acute coronary microthromboembolism, especially with stable cavitation using low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) and dodecafluoropentane-loaded acoustic phase-change nanoparticles (DDFP@NPs). Therefore, our study sought to perform animal experiments using this novel treatment method in a porcine model with acute coronary microthromboembolism for further investigation of potential therapeutic values. METHODS: Porcine model with acute coronary thromboembolism was established using percutaneous coronary intervention and autologous thrombus injection. For ultrasound assisted thrombolysis, DDFP@NPs were prepared by rotary evaporation and sonication process, and LIFU was optimized. Echocardiography and TTC staining were performed for the evaluation of porcine model establishment and treatment effect. RESULTS: The treatment using LIFU guided DDFP@NPs had almost completely recanalized culprit coronary branch after treatment procedure, and smaller infarcted size (5.4 ± 1.0%), better LVEF (52.5 ± 1.8%) and better coronary microcirculation after 28 days of treatment, which outperformed treatments using LIFU+SonoVue microbubbles (infarcted size: 26.4 ± 3.5% and LVEF: 37.2 ± 3.1%) and LIFU only (infarcted size: 32.2 ± 3.1% and LVEF: 32.2 ± 0.4%) (all P < 0.05), while the treatment effect were similar to treatment using intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator (infarcted size: 4.9 ± 0.9% and LVEF: 53.1 ± 1.1%) (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study has innovatively established a treatment method using DDFP@NPs combined with LIFU irradiation for coronary thrombolysis and verified its treatment effect with high-efficient thrombolysis in the in-vivo experiments, which can be considered as powerful experimental evident of the novel method for potential clinical use of acute coronary thrombolysis. Multidimensional experimental investigations and cautious verification may need before the method could be used as treatment before preliminary clinical trials.",1
"OBJECTIVES: MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) is an emerging non-invasive treatment. It is helpful in investigating the mid-term grading efficacy and safety of MRgFUS, and possible risk factors in participants with painful bone metastases. METHODS: This four-center prospective study enrolled 96 participants between June 2016 and May 2019 with painful bone metastases. The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Brief Pain Inventory-Quality of Life (BPI-QoL) score, morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD), and the adverse events (AEs) were recorded before and at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after MRgFUS. The repeated ANOVA tests were used to analyze the change in NRS and BPI-QoL, and logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the possible risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 82 participants completed the 3-month follow-up period. And 16 (19.5%) participants were complete responders (CR), 46 (56.1%) participants were effective responders (ER), and the other 20 (24.4%) participants were non-responders (NR). The NRS (2.67 ± 2.47 at 3 months compared to 6.38 ± 1.70 before treatment) and BPI-QoL score (3.11 ± 2.51 at 3 months compared to 5.40 ± 1.85 before treatment) significantly decreased after the treatment at all time points (p < 0.001). Eleven adverse events were recorded and they were all cured within 1 to 52 days after treatment. The non-perfused volume (NPV) ratio (p = 0.001) and the bone metastases lesion type (p = 0.025) were the key risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: MRgFUS can be used as a non-invasive, effective, and safe modality to treat painful bone metastases. NPV ratio and the lesion type may be used as affecting factors to predict the mid-term efficacy of MRgFUS. KEY POINTS: • MRgFUS can be considered a non-invasive, effective, and safe modality to treat painful bone metastases. • The NRS and BPI-QoL score at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months all decreased significantly (p < 0.001) after receiving MRgFUS. Among 82 participants, 16 (19.5%) were complete responders, 46 (56.1%) were effective responders, and the other 20 (24.4%) were non-responders. • According to logistic regression analysis, non-perfused volume ratio and the bone metastases lesion type were the affecting factors to predict the mid-term efficacy of MRgFUS. The adjusted OR of non-perfused volume ratio was 0.86 (p = 0.001), and osteoblastic lesion type was 0.06 (p = 0.025).",1
"Background Recent consensus statements and clinical trials have assessed the value of MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery for pain palliation of bone metastases; however, a comparison with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has not been performed. Purpose To compare safety and effectiveness data of MRI-guided focused ultrasound and EBRT in the treatment of bone metastases. Materials and Methods Participants with painful bone metastases, excluding skull and vertebral bodies, were enrolled in a prospective open-label nonrandomized phase II study between January 2017 and May 2019 and underwent either MRI-guided focused ultrasound or EBRT. The primary end point was the overall response rate at 1-month following treatment, assessed via the numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain (0-10 scale, with zero meaning ""no pain"" and 10 meaning ""the worst pain imaginable""). Secondary end points were improvements at 12-month follow-up in NRS and quality of life (QoL) measures, including the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), QoL-Questionnaire Cancer-15 Palliative Care (QLQ-C15-PAL), and QoL-Questionnaire Bone Metastases-22 (QLQ-BM22) and analysis of adverse events. Statistical analyses, including linear regression, χ2 test, and Student t test followed the per-protocol principle. Results Among 198 participants, 100 underwent MRI-guided focused ultrasound (mean age, 63 years ± 13 [SD]; 51 women), and 98 underwent EBRT (mean age, 65 years ± 14; 52 women). The overall response rates at 1-month follow-up were 91% (91 of 100) and 67% (66 of 98), respectively, in the focused ultrasound and EBRT arms (P < .001), and complete response rates were 43% (43 of 100) and 16% (16 of 98) (P < .001). The mean baseline NRS score was 7.0 ± 2.1 for focused ultrasound and 6.6 ± 2.4 for EBRT (P = .16); at 1-month follow-up, they were reduced to 3.2 ± 0.3 and 5.1 ± 0.3 (P < .001), respectively. QLQ-C15-PAL for physical function (P = .002), appetite (P < .001), nausea and vomiting (P < .001), dyspnea (P < .001), and QoL (P < .001) scores were lower in the focused ultrasound group. The overall adverse event rates were 15% (15 of 100) after focused ultrasound and 24% (24 of 98) after EBRT. Conclusion MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery and external beam radiation therapy showed similar improvements in pain palliation and quality of life, with low adverse event rates. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

"Magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is an innovative treatment for patients with painful bone metastases. The adoption of MR-HIFU will be influenced by several factors beyond its effectiveness. To identify contextual factors affecting the adoption of MR-HIFU, we conducted a group concept mapping (GCM) study in four European countries. The GCM was conducted in two phases. First, the participants brainstormed statements guided by the focus prompt ""One factor that may influence the uptake of MR-HIFU in clinical practice is..."". Second, the participants sorted statements into categories and rated the statements according to their importance and changeability. To generate a concept map, multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were conducted, and average ratings for each (cluster of) factors were calculated. Forty-five participants contributed to phase I and/or II (56% overall participation rate). The resulting concept map comprises 49 factors, organized in 12 clusters: ""competitive treatments"", ""physicians' attitudes"", ""alignment of resources"", ""logistics and workflow"", ""technical disadvantages"", ""radiotherapy as first-line therapy"", ""aggregating knowledge and improving awareness"", ""clinical effectiveness"", ""patients' preferences"", ""reimbursement"", ""cost-effectiveness"" and ""hospital costs"". The factors identified echo those from the literature, but their relevance and interrelationship are case-specific. Besides evidence on clinical effectiveness, contextual factors from 10 other clusters should be addressed to support adoption of MR-HIFU.",1
"The aim of this study was to ascertain the safety of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 (CIN 2/3) in patients with fertility requirements. This was a prospective one-arm study. Consecutive CIN 2/3 patients diagnosed with histopathology were screened, enrolled and treated from September 2019 to September 2020 in the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College. All patients were treated with a combination of HIFU and antiviral treatment with REBACIN. The scheduled follow-up visits were 1 week, 1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo and 12 mo after surgery. The primary outcomes included cure and human papillomavirus clearance rates. We screened 287 consecutive CIN 2/3 patients in our hospital, 29 of whom were enrolled and treated in this study. The cure rate reached 82.8% at 7 mo after treatment and 96.6% within 1 y. The HPV-negative rate reached 72.4% (21/29) around 6 mo after treatment, with mild side effects during and after the procedure. Our study suggests that in CIN 2/3 study participants with fertility requirements, HIFU + REBACIN therapy is a safe and effective therapeutic option with a high cure rate, HPV clearance and few side effects.",1
"BACKGROUND: In this study, the changes of vaginal microbiome after focused ultrasound (FU) treatment were evaluated to explore the possible mechanism of FU in the treatment of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. METHODS: This study was nested in the FU arm of a prospective cohort study. A total of 37 patients diagnosed with HR-HPV infection-related cervical low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study from October 2020 to November 2021, and these patients were treated with FU. We used 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing to profile the vaginal microbiota composition of patients before and 3 months after FU treatment. RESULTS: After FU treatment, HR-HPV was cleared in 24 patients, with a clearance rate of 75.0% (24/32). Lactobacillus iners was the predominant species among all samples. No significant difference was found in alpha-diversity index before and 3 months after FU treatment (P > 0.05), but the rarefaction curves showed that the vaginal microbial diversity before FU treatment was higher than that after FU treatment. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) showed that Bifidobacterium contributed the most to the difference between the two groups at the genus level, and the abundance after FU treatment was significantly higher than that before treatment (P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease of vaginal microbial diversity may be related to the clearance of HR-HPV infection, and FU treatment contributed to the decrease of vaginal microbial diversity. Increased Bifidobacterium abundance in the vaginal microbiome may be associated with clearance of HR-HPV infection, and FU treatment may contribute to the increase in Bifidobacterium abundance. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:  This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on 23/11/2020 (ChiCTR2000040162).",1
"Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) are high grade glioma (HGG) that occur primarily in children, and represent a leading cause of death in pediatric patients with brain tumors with a median overall survival of only 8-11 months. While these lesions were previously thought to behave similarly to adult HGG, emerging data have demonstrated that DIPG are a biologically distinct entity from adult HGG frequently driven by mutations in the histone genes H3.3 and H3.1 not found in adult glioma. While biopsy of DIPG was historically felt to confer unacceptable risk of morbidity and mortality, multiple studies have demonstrated that stereotactic biopsy of DIPG is safe, allowing not only for improved understanding of DIPG but also forming the basis for protocols for personalized medicine in DIPG. However, current options for personalized medicine in DIPG are limited by the lack of efficacious targeted therapies for the mutations commonly found in DIPG. Multiple treatment modalities including targeted therapies, immunotherapy, convection enhanced delivery (CED), and focused ultrasound, are in various stages of investigation.",1
"Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), now known as Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) is a devastating pediatric brain tumor with limited treatment options and a very poor prognosis. Despite more than 250 clinical trials aimed to treat children diagnosed with DMG, no curative therapies currently exist for this patient population. A major obstacle has been the intact blood brain barrier (BBB) which prevents most therapeutics from crossing into the tumor bed. Focused Ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging, noninvasive medical technology which has been shown in both preclinical and clinical research to disrupt the blood brain barrier safely and temporarily. FUS blood brain barrier opening has been studied in combination with chemotherapies in preclinical DMG models, and this technology is now being investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors. Focused ultrasound has additional mechanisms of action, including sonodynamic therapy and radiation sensitization, that hold promise as future DMG therapies as well. This paper, largely based off the proceedings from a workshop held by the Focused Ultrasound Foundation in October of 2021, summarizes the current state of the field of focused ultrasound for DIPG/DMG, including preclinical, technical, and clinical summaries in addition to recommended next steps for continued advancement of the game changing technology of Focused Ultrasound.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most prevalent movement disorders in adults and may be highly disabling for some. Magnetic resonance image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS) has been shown to control tremor efficaciously and with acceptable risk. To date, paresthesia and ataxia are the most common adverse effects (AE). Nevertheless, the impact of MRIgFUS thalamotomy on balance is not well established. METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent MRIgFUS for ET and completed 6 months of follow-up. Tremor severity and functional disability were assessed using the Essential Tremor Rating Scale and the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was applied to objectively measure balance status. RESULTS: All treatments were successful. The sonication target was 1-2 mm above the depth of the intercommissural line. Procedures lasted less the 2 h, with an average of 8 sonications per patient. Twenty-four patients were included in the tremor analysis. The hand tremor score was improved by 76% after 6 months of follow-up and 87% of patients self-reported marked improvement (≥75%). Disability scores showed marked improvement (78%), leading to a significant improvement in quality of life. At the final follow-up, 48% of the patients reported no side effects. When present, AE were generally transient and were considered mild in 96% of affected patients. Paresthesia and subjective feeling of unsteadiness were the most common persistent complaints (23% and 20%, respectively). Regarding objective ataxia, BBS scores remained stable throughout follow-up for most patients. Only 2 patients suffered a mild worsening of balance although no patients experienced moderate or severe ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective feeling of unsteadiness is one of the most frequent AE after MRIgFUS, although objective ataxia is infrequent and mild. Selecting the most appropriate lesion location and procedural parameters should increase treatment benefits while reducing side effects.",1
"OBJECTIVE: One of the key metrics that is used to predict the likelihood of success of MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy is the overall calvarial skull density ratio (SDR). However, this measure does not fully predict the sonication parameters that would be required or the technical success rates. The authors aimed to assess other skull characteristics that may also contribute to technical success. METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied consecutive patients with essential tremor who were treated by MRgFUS at their center between 2017 and 2021. They evaluated the correlation between the different treatment parameters, particularly maximum power and energy delivered, with a range of patients' skull metrics and demographics. Machine learning algorithms were applied to investigate whether sonication parameters could be predicted from skull density metrics alone and whether including combined local transducer SDRs with overall calvarial SDR would increase model accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 77.1 (SD 9.2) years, and 78% of treatments (49/63) were performed in males. The mean SDR was 0.51 (SD 0.10). Among the evaluated metrics, SDR had the highest correlation with the maximum power used in treatment (ρ = -0.626, p < 0.001; proportion of local SDR values ≤ 0.8 group also had ρ = +0.626, p < 0.001) and maximum energy delivered (ρ = -0.680, p < 0.001). Machine learning algorithms achieved a moderate ability to predict maximum power and energy required from the local and overall SDRs (accuracy of approximately 80% for maximum power and approximately 55% for maximum energy), and high ability to predict average maximum temperature reached from the local and overall SDRs (approximately 95% accuracy). CONCLUSIONS: The authors compared a number of skull metrics against SDR and showed that SDR was one of the best indicators of treatment parameters when used alone. In addition, a number of other machine learning algorithms are proposed that may be explored to improve its accuracy when additional data are obtained. Additional metrics related to eventual sonication parameters should also be identified and explored.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy is an innovative method for the unilateral treatment of essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) related tremor. Our aim was to assess cognitive changes following MRgFUS thalamotomy to better investigate its safety profile. METHODS: We prospectively investigated the cognitive and neurobehavioral profile of patients consecutively undergoing MRgFUS within a 2-year period. Patients had a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment before and six months after MRgFUS thalamotomy. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 40 patients (males 38; mean age±SD 67.7 ± 10.7; mean disease duration±SD 9.3 ± 5.6; ET 22, PD 18 patients). For the whole sample, improvements were detected in tremor (Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Rating Scale for tremor 35.79 ± 14.39 vs 23.03 ± 10.95; p < 0.001), anxiety feelings (Hamilton Anxiety rating scale 5.36 ± 3.80 vs 2.54 ± 3.28, p < 0.001), in the overall cognitive status (MMSE 25.93 ± 3.76 vs 27.54 ± 2.46, p 0.003; MOCA 22.80 ± 4.08 vs 24.48 ± 3.13, p < 0.001), and in quality of life (Quality of life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire 36.14 ± 12.91 vs 5.14 ± 6.90, p < 0.001 and PD Questionnaire-8 5.61 ± 4.65 vs 1.39 ± 2.33, p 0.001). No changes were detected in frontal and executive functions, verbal fluency and memory, abstract reasoning and problem-solving abilities. CONCLUSION: Our study moves a step forward in establishing the cognitive sequelae of MRgFUS thalamotomy and in endorsing effectiveness and safety.",1
"An orthotopically allografted mouse GL26 glioma model (Ccr2RFP/wt-Cx3cr1GFP/wt) was used to evaluate the effect of transient, focal opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) on the composition of tumor-associated macrophages and microglia (TAMs). BBB opening was induced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) combined with microbubbles. CX3CR1-GFP cells and CCR2-RFP cells in brain tumors were quantified in microscopic images. Tumors in animals treated with a single session of MRgFUS did not exhibit significant changes in cell numbers when compared with tumors in animals not receiving FUS. However, tumors that received two or three sessions of MRgFUS had significantly increased amounts of both CX3CR1-GFP and CCR2-RFP cells. The effect of MRgFUS on immune cell composition was also characterized and quantified using flow cytometry. Glioma implantation resulted in increased amounts of lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils in the brain parenchyma. Tumors administered MRgFUS exhibited increased numbers of monocytes and monocyte-derived TAMs. In addition, MRgFUS-treated tumors exhibited more CD80+ cells in monocytes and microglia. In summary, transient, focal opening of the BBB using MRgFUS combined with microbubbles can activate the homing and differentiation of monocytes and induce a shift toward a more pro-inflammatory status of the immune environment in glioblastoma.",1
"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine the effect of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) in ischemic heart failure (IHF) and explore the potential neuroimmune mechanism. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to ultrasound (US) with specific parameters, and electrocardiograms were recorded to analyze the effect of LIFU and/or vagal denervation on heart rate. Thereafter, myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by left anterior artery ligation, and LIFU was performed three times a day for 25 days after MI. Echocardiography, Masson staining, and ELISA were used to evaluate the effect of LIFU on the structure and function of the heart. Finally, ELISA, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis were performed to determine the effect of LIFU on the inflammation and the expression of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP)-related mediators. RESULTS: LIFU reduced heart rate in rats (control vs LIFU, P < .01), and vagotomy (VT) eliminated this effect of LIFU on heart rate (VT vs LIFU + VT, P > .01). LIFU-ameliorated IHF in terms of cardiac structure and function (MI vs MI + LIFU, P < .01), but VT abrogated the beneficial effect of LIFU (MI + VT vs MI + LIFU + VT, P > .01). After the treatment of LIFU, decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines, increased proportion of anti-inflammatory macrophages, and increased expression of CAP-related mediators (MI vs MI + LIFU, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: LIFU ameliorates IHF whereas the CAP plays a promising role. LIFU has the potential to be a novel nonpharmacological and noninvasive therapy for the treatment of coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular diseases.",1
"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of focused ultrasound (FU) at different focal depths in treating vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 84 patients with VLS. Among them, 43 cases were treated with FU at a focal depth of 2.5 mm and 41 cases at a focal depth of 4.0 mm. Therapeutic time, treatment energy, postoperative efficacy, complications and recurrence rates were compared. RESULTS: No statistically substantially differences in age, disease course, history of immune system diseases, lesion size and severity of symptoms were found between the two groups. All patients successfully received FU therapy. No significant difference in curative rate was observed between the two groups at 3, 6 and 12 months after FU therapy. At 12 months after FU therapy, the recurrence rate of the experimental group (FU treatment at 2.5 mm focal depth) was lower than the control group (FU treatment at 4.0 mm focal depth) (7.0% vs 24.4%, p = 0.027). The experimental group was treated for a shorter period of time [22.69 ± 0.64 (min) vs 24.93 ± 0.72(min), p = 0.022] and at a lower dose[5,026.05 ± 148.00(J) vs 5,484.26 ± 160.60(J) p = 0.039]. CONCLUSION: Compared with that at the routine focal depth (4.0 mm), FU therapy at a low treatment depth (2.5 mm) can achieve a similar therapeutic effect but lower recurrence rate, therapeutic time and treatment energy. This work provides insight into the optimization of clinical protocols.",1
"OBJECTIVE: To compare the acute and chronic safety and treatment effects of non-invasive hepatic histotripsy vs. percutaneous microwave (MW) ablation in a healthy porcine model. METHODS: This was a dual-arm study in which each animal (n = 14) received either a single hepatic microwave (n = 6) or histotripsy (n = 6 single treatment; n = 2 double treatment) under ultrasound guidance. The goal was to create 2.5-3.0 cm short-axis treatments in similar locations across modalities. Animals were survived for 1 month with contrast-enhanced CT imaging on days 0, 2, 7, 14, and 28. On day 28, necropsy and histopathology were performed. RESULTS: All procedures were well-tolerated. MW ablation zones were longer and more oblong, but equivalent in the short axes to histotripsy zones on immediate post-procedure CT (p < 0.001 and p = 0.45, respectively). Overall, MW volumes were larger (21.4 cm3 vs. 13.4 cm3; p = 0.001) and histotripsy treatment zones were more spherical (p = 0.007). Histotripsy zones were close to the prescribed size (p < 0.001). Over the study period, histotripsy treatment zones decreased in volume while microwave ablation zones slightly increased (-83% vs. +17%, p = 0.001). There were several imaging-only findings: Branch portal vein thrombus with both histotripsy (7/8) and MW (6/6), hematoma in 2/6 MW only, and a gallbladder injury in 1/6 MW animals. The ablation zones demonstrated complete cellular destruction for both modalities. CONCLUSION: Histotripsy was associated with more spherical treatments, fewer biliary complications, and greater treatment zone involution. Hepatic MW and histotripsy treatment in a normal porcine model appear at least equally effective for creating treatment zones with a similar safety profile. KEY POINTS: • Microwave ablation and histotripsy for liver treatment in a healthy porcine model yield equivalent procedural tolerance and cellular destruction. • Histotripsy was associated with more spherical treatments, fewer biliary complications, and greater treatment zone involution over the 28-day follow-up period. • These findings confirm the safety and efficacy of hepatic histotripsy and support the pursuit of clinical trials to further evaluate the translatability of these results.",1
"A toroidal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer was used to non-invasively treat liver tissues in vivo in a pig model. The transducer was divided into 32 concentric rings with equal surface areas operating at 2.5 MHz. First, attenuation of skin, fat, muscle and liver tissues was measured in fresh animal samples to adjust the energy delivered to the focal zone. Then, 8 animals were included in the present protocol and placed in a dorsal decubitus proclive position at an angle of 15°. The device was held by hand, and sonications were performed during apnea. Two thermal HIFU lesions were created in 40 s in each animal. The average abdominal wall thickness was 14.8 ± 1.3 mm (12.5-17.6 mm). The longest and shortest axes of the HIFU ablations were 20.9 ± 6.3 mm (14.0-33.7 mm) and 14.2 ± 5.5 mm (7.0-22.0 mm), respectively. All HIFU lesions were visible on sonograms. The correlation between the dimensions of the HIFU lesions observed on sonograms and those obtained during gross examination was r = 0.84. Creating large and fast ablations with reliable ultrasound imaging guidance in the liver using this handheld device may represent a new therapeutic option for patients with liver tumors.",1
"PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of histotripsy subcutaneous (SQ) fat treatment in an in-vivo porcine model, and evaluate evolution of the treated volume on MRI and pathology. METHODS/MATERIALS: 10 histotripsy SQ fat treatments were completed in 5 swine, divided into four groups based on pre-determined survival: day 0 (n = 4), day 7 (n = 2), day 28 (n = 2), and day 56 (n = 2). A 4.0 × 4.0x2.0 cm ovoid treatment was created in the fat pad of the posterior thorax. MRI of survived animals were obtained on day 7 (n = 6), day 28 (n = 4), and day 56 (n = 2), and reviewed for size and imaging characteristics. Technical success was defined as the creation of a treatment zone in the targeted SQ fat. Skin firmness and indentation were qualitatively scored. RESULTS: Histotripsy had a 100% (10/10) technical success for creation of SQ fat treatments. Mean treatment time was 35.5 min (range 35-36.5). The volume of treated SQ fat demonstrated 92% volume reduction over the study. Day 0 gross pathology treatment had a mean volume of 12.6 cm3 (± 2.1) (prescribed volume of 16.7 cm3), which decreased to 8.3 cm3 (± 2.8) by day 7 (34% overall decrease), 3.0 cm3 (± 0.5) by day 28 (76% overall decrease), and 1.0 cm3 (± 1.2) by day 56 (92% overall decrease). Mean firmness and indentation scores showed no change from baseline at all time points, with no overlying skin injury. CONCLUSION: Histotripsy safely and effectively treated SQ fat of an in-vivo porcine model, with volume reduction over time.",1
"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the effect of fat-layer thickness and focal depth on the pressure and temperature distribution of tissue. METHODS: Computer simulations were performed for the skin-fat layer models during high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment. The acoustic pressure field was calculated using the nonlinear Westervelt equation and coupled with the Pennes bioheat transfer equation to obtain the temperature distribution. To investigate the effect of the thickness of the fat layer on pressure and thermal distributions, the thickness of the fat layer behind the focal point (z = 13.5 mm) changed from 8 to 24 mm by 2 mm step. The pressure and temperature distribution spectra were extracted. RESULTS: The simulated results were validated using the experimental results with a 98% correlation coefficient (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference between the pressure amplitude and temperature distribution for the 8-14 mm thickness of the fat layer (p < 0.05). By changing the focal point from 11.5 to 13.5 mm, the maximum acoustic pressure at the focal point increased 66%, and the maximum temperature was 56%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Considering the specific treatment plan for each patient, according to the skin and fat layer thicknesses, can help prevent side effects and optimize the treatment process of HIFU.",1
"Bilateral thermal capsulotomy with magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS-capsulotomy) is a promising treatment option for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Herein, we investigated the effects of bilateral thermal capsulotomy with MRgFUS on neural oscillations in treatment-refractory OCD patients. Eight patients underwent resting-state MEG with repeated recordings before and 1 and 6 months after MRgFUS-capsulotomy, and the oscillatory power and phase coherence over the entire cortical sensor area were measured. After MRgFUS-capsulotomy, the high beta band power in the fronto-central and temporal areas decreased at 1 month and remained stable for 6 months. Cortical connectivity of the high beta band gradually decreased over the entire cortical area during the following 6 months. At 1 month, improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms was significantly correlated with changes in high beta band power in both the frontotemporal and temporal areas. The treatment effect of MRgFUS-capsulotomy may be attributed to the cortical high beta band. Our results provide an advanced understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying MRgFUS-capsulotomy and other neuromodulatory interventions for treatment-refractory OCD.",1
"OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in combination with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in treating patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). METHODS: The data of unresectable LAPC patients who received chemotherapy with or without HIFU ablation were retrieved retrospectively. The overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), cancer antigen 19-9 response rate, and safety were compared between these two groups before and after propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS: Overall, 254 patients with LAPC were included, of whom 92 underwent HIFU ablation. After PSM to control for potential biases, HIFU was associated with improved OS (12.8 versus 12.2 months, log-rank P = .046), as compared to patients without HIFU ablation. Patients with numeric rating scale (NRS) less than 4, and receiving HIFU ablation were significantly associated with improved OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.365 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.148-0.655], P = .002; aHR = 0.490 [95% CI = 0.250-0.961], P = .038; respectively) by multivariate analyses with the adjustment of age, NRS, and tumor size. ORR was also observed to be higher in HIFU group of 30.0% than in the chemotherapy group of 13.3% (P = .039). No severe adverse events of special interest or HIFU-caused deaths were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with unresectable LAPC who received gemcitabine-based chemotherapy might benefit from additional HIFU ablation.",1
"Motor fluctuations (MF) are deemed by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) as the most troublesome disease feature resulting from the increasing impairment in responsiveness to dopaminergic drug treatments. MF are characterized by the loss of a stable response to levodopa over the nychthemeron with the reappearance of motor (and non-motor) parkinsonian clinical signs at various moments during the day and night. They normally appear after a few years of levodopa treatment and with a variable, though overall increasing severity, over the disease course. The armamentarium of first-line treatment options has widened in the last decade with new once-a-daily compounds, including a catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitor - Opicapone-, two MAO-B inhibitors plus channel blocker - Zonisamide and Safinamide and one amantadine extended-release formulation - ADS5012. In addition to apomorphine injection or oral levodopa dispersible tablets, which have been available for a long time, new on-demand therapies such as apomorphine sublingual or levodopa inhaled formulations have recently shown efficacy as rescue therapies for Off-time treatment. When the management of MF becomes difficult in spite of oral/on-demand options, more complex therapies should be considered, including surgical, i.e. deep brain stimulation, or device-aided therapies with pump systems delivering continuous subcutaneous or intestinal levodopa or subcutaneous apomorphine formulation. Older and less commonly used ablative techniques (radiofrequency pallidotomy) may also be effective while there is still scarce data regarding Off-time reduction using a new lesional approach, i.e. magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound. The choice between the different advanced therapies options is a shared decision that should consider physician opinion on contraindication/main target symptom, patients' preference, caregiver's availability together with public health systems and socio-economic environment. The choice of the right/first add-on treatment is still a matter of debate as well as the proper time for an advanced therapy to be considered. In this narrative review, we discuss all the above cited aspects of MF in patients with PD, including their phenomenology, management, by means of pharmacological and advanced therapies, on-going clinical trials and future research and treatment perspectives.",1
"Magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a rapidly developing technique used for tremor relief in tremor-predominant Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor that has demonstrated successful results. Here, we describe the neuropathological findings in a woman who died from a fall 10 days after successful MRgFUS for tremor-predominant PD. Histological analysis demonstrates the characteristic early postoperative MRI findings including 3 distinct zones on T2-weighted imaging: (1) a hypointense core, (2) a hyperintense region with hypointense rim, and (3) a slightly hyperintense, poorly marginated surrounding area. Histopathological analyses also demonstrate the suspected cellular processes composing each of these regions including central hemorrhagic necrosis with surrounding cytotoxic edema and a rim of mostly unaffected vasogenic edema with some reactive and reparative processes. Overall, this case demonstrates the correlation of postoperative imaging findings with the subacute neuropathological findings after MRgFUS for PD.",1
"Background: MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA) is under investigation for whole-gland ablation of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The ideal method for post-TULSA bladder drainage through postoperative suprapubic tube (SPT) vs indwelling urethral catheter (UC) has not been established. The objective of this study was to evaluate urinary outcomes after whole-gland TULSA, comparing postoperative SPT with UC. Materials and Methods: Two-institution retrospective analysis of whole-gland TULSA for men with grade group 1 and 2 prostate cancer. One institution placed SPT at the time of TULSA with clamp trials (day 10) and removal once voiding. The second placed UC until void trial (day 7). Outcomes included the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), urinary bother score, catheter reinsertion, stricture, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), and incontinence. Results: Forty-five patients (median age 67) were analyzed. The UC cohort (N = 26) was older (p = 0.007) than the SPT cohort (N = 19) but with similar baseline prostate volumes, IPSS, and urinary bother scores. Patients receiving UC had fewer days with catheter (p = 0.013). Although UC patients suffered more lower urinary tract symptoms at 1-month post-TULSA, there was no significant difference between IPSS scores at baseline and 6 months after surgery regardless of urinary management strategy, although the UC group noted significantly decreased urinary bother. Rates of infection were similar between groups. Six strictures were observed overall, with more in the SPT group, although the difference was not significant (4/19 [21.1%] SPT; 2/26 [7.7%] UC). At 6 months, incontinence rates were low and similar between groups (2/19 [10.5%] SPT; 4/26 [15.4%] UC) and only one patient (UC) required CIC. Conclusions: Our overall findings suggest that SPT and UC are both acceptable options for postoperative bladder drainage after whole-gland TULSA, with statistically similar rates of urinary complications but a slightly different side effect profile.",1
"Boiling histotripsy (BH) is a focused ultrasound technology that uses millisecond-long pulses with shock fronts to induce mechanical tissue ablation. The pulsing scheme and mechanisms of BH differ from those of cavitation cloud histotripsy, which was previously developed for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The goal of the work described here was to evaluate the feasibility of using BH to ablate fresh ex vivo human prostate tissue as a proof of principle for developing BH for prostate applications. Fresh human prostate samples (N = 24) were obtained via rapid autopsy (<24 h after death, institutional review board exempt). Samples were analyzed using shear wave elastography to ensure that mechanical properties of autopsy tissue were clinically representative. Samples were exposed to BH using 10- or 1-ms pulses with 1% duty cycle under real-time B-mode and Doppler imaging. Volumetric lesions were created by sonicating 1-4 rectangular planes spaced 1 mm apart, containing a grid of foci spaced 1-2 mm apart. Tissue then was evaluated grossly and histologically, and the lesion content was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Observed shear wave elastography characterization of ex vivo prostate tissue (37.9 ± 22.2 kPa) was within the typical range observed clinically. During BH, hyperechoic regions were visualized at the focus on B-mode, and BH-induced bubbles were also detected using power Doppler. As treatment progressed, hypoechoic regions of tissue appeared, suggesting successful tissue fractionation. BH treatment was twofold faster using shorter pulses (1 ms vs. 10 ms). Histological analysis revealed lesions containing completely homogenized cell debris, consistent with histotripsy-induced mechanical ablation. It was therefore determined that BH is feasible in fresh ex vivo human prostate tissue producing desired mechanical ablation. The study supports further work aimed at translating BH technology as a clinical option for prostate ablation.",1
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer types. Early detection of PC offers the best chance of successful treatment. A noninvasive, image-guided therapy mediated by targeted nanoparticles (NPs) has the potential to improve the efficacy and safety of cancer therapies. Herein, we report a sonosensitive nanoparticle modified with anti-PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) antibodies to activate target prostate tumors. These nanoparticles (PFP@IR780@PTX@liposome NPs) were co-loaded with the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel and the sonosensitizer IR780, as well as phase-changeable perfluorocarbon (PFC) liquids. The liquid-gas phase change could be induced by low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) in vitro. We found that the PFP@IR780@PTX@liposome NPs can specifically accumulate in prostate tumors after LIFU irradiation, as monitored by ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. Meanwhile, docetaxel was controllably released from the nanoparticles to achieve enhanced chemotherapeutic therapy in vivo. These sonosensitive phase-changeable NPs can visually treat prostate cancers effectively and have a clinical potential.",1
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies in men, but patient outcomes are varied depending on extent of disease. Radical, whole-gland therapies, such as prostatectomy or radiotherapy, are definitive treatments for PCa, but they are associated with significant morbidity, including erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. Focal therapies for PCa, whereby the part of gland harboring disease is selectively treated, spares the normal surrounding structures, and minimizes the morbidity associated with whole gland treatment. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance provides advantages over ultrasound guidance, such as better localization and targeting of clinically significant PCa (csPCa), as well as MRI thermometry which optimizes tissue ablation temperatures. This review will discuss two MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) techniques - transrectal MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) and TULSA (transurethral ultrasound ablation) ablation for localized PCa. Overall, recent major trials for MRgFUS and TULSA have shown promising oncological and functional results in the treatment of low- to intermediate-risk PCa. Recent Phase II MRgFUS trials have shown better oncologic outcomes than the published results for focal ultrasound guided HIFU and may justify the additional costs associated with MRI guidance. While initial studies on TULSA have focused on subtotal gland ablation, recent trials assessing oncological outcomes for focal treatment of angular sectors have shown promise.",1
"UNLABELLED: The non-perfused volume (NPV) is an important indicator of treatment success immediately after prostate ablation. However, visualization of the NPV first requires an injection of MRI contrast agents into the bloodstream, which has many downsides. Purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning model capable of predicting the NPV immediately after prostate ablation therapy without the need for MRI contrast agents. A modified 2D deep learning UNet model was developed to predict the post-treatment NPV. MRI imaging data from 95 patients who had previously undergone prostate ablation therapy for treatment of localized prostate cancer were used to train, validate, and test the model. Model inputs were T1/T2-weighted and thermometry MRI images, which were always acquired without any MRI contrast agents and prior to the final NPV image on treatment-day. Model output was the predicted NPV. Model accuracy was assessed using the Dice-Similarity Coefficient (DSC) by comparing the predicted to ground truth NPV. A radiologist also performed a qualitative assessment of NPV. Mean (std) DSC score for predicted NPV was 85% ± 8.1% compared to ground truth. Model performance was significantly better for slices with larger prostate radii (> 24 mm) and for whole-gland rather than partial ablation slices. The predicted NPV was indistinguishable from ground truth for 31% of images. Feasibility of predicting NPV using a UNet model without MRI contrast agents was clearly established. If developed further, this could improve patient treatment outcomes and could obviate the need for contrast agents altogether. Trial Registration Numbers Three studies were used to populate the data: NCT02766543, NCT03814252 and NCT03350529. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13534-022-00250-y.",1
"Magnetic resonance-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) is an established method for producing localized hyperthermia. Given the real-time imaging and acoustic energy modulation, this modality enables precise temperature control within a defined area. Many thermal applications are being explored with this noninvasive, nonionizing technology, such as hyperthermia generation, to release drugs from thermosensitive liposomal carriers. These drugs can include chemotherapies such as doxorubicin, for which targeted release is desired due to the dose-limiting systemic side effects, namely cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin is a mainstay for treating a variety of malignant tumors and is commonly used in relapsed or recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). RMS is the most common solid soft tissue extracranial tumor in children and young adults. Despite aggressive, multimodal therapy, RMS survival rates have remained the same for the past 30 years. To explore a solution for addressing this unmet need, an experimental protocol was developed to evaluate the release of thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (TLD) in an immunocompetent, syngeneic RMS mouse model using MRgHIFU as the source of hyperthermia for drug release.",1
"AIM: To explore the efficacy and possible mechanisms of Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) in alleviating spasticity caused by Spinal cord injury (SCI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We selected male Sprague?Dawley rats as subjects and performed transverse injuries on the T9 vertebra of their spinal cord (SC) to build SCI. On the 7th day after SCI, LIFU treatment was performed below the SCI segment once a day for 20 min, for 4 consecutive weeks. During treatment, a pressure sensor was used to assess the degree of spasticity. After treatment, the SC tissues from the treatment sites of the SCI+LIFU(-) and SCI+LIFU(+) groups were extracted, and high-throughput sequencing was performed to identify the changes in proteomics. In addition, expression of the growth associated protein 43 (Gap43) was validated by western blotting. RESULTS: The behavioral results suggested that after 2 weeks of SCI, the rats were significantly induced to have a spastic reaction (p < 0.05), while after 4 weeks of LIFU treatment, the spastic response of rats was significantly improved (p < 0.05). Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in Gap43 expression in the SCI+LIFU(-) group compared with the sham group, whereas after 4 weeks of LIFU treatment, Gap43 protein expression was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that LIFU is an alternative treatment that can effectively relieve spastic reactions caused by SCI, possibly by reducing abnormal neuroplasticity or axon regeneration below the SCI segment.",1
"BACKGROUND: We aimed to prepare a non-invasive, reproducible, and controllable rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage with focused ultrasound (FUS). METHODS: A rat intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) model was established by combining FUS and microbubbles (μBs), and edaravone was used to verify whether the free radical scavenger had a protective effect on the model. The brain tissue of each group was sectioned to observe the gross histology, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, cerebral infarction volume, and histopathological changes. RESULTS: Compared with the FUS group, the BBB permeability was significantly increased in the FUS + μBs (F&B) group (p = 0.0021). The second coronal slice in the F&B group had an obvious hemorrhage lesion, and the FUS + μBs + edaravone (F&B&E) group had smaller hemorrhage areas; however, ICH did not occur in the FUS group. The cerebral infarction volume in the F&B group was significantly larger than that in the FUS group (p = 0.0030) and F&B&E group (p = 0.0208). HE staining results showed that nerve fibrinolysis, neuronal necrosis, microglia production, and erythrocytes were found in both the F&B group and the F&B&E group, but the areas of the nerve fibrinolysis and neuronal necrosis in the F&B group were larger than the F&B&E group. CONCLUSIONS: A rat ICH model was successfully prepared using the μBs assisted FUS treatment, and edaravone had a therapeutic effect on this model. This model can be used to study the pathophysiological mechanism of ICH-related diseases and in preclinical research on related new drugs.",1
"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality around the world, and surgery is still the most direct and effective way to remove ICH. However, the potential risks brought by surgery, such as normal brain tissue damage, post-operative infection, and difficulty in removing deep hematoma, are still the main problems in the surgical treatment of ICH. Activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is reported to show a good therapeutic effect in hematoma clearance. Herein, a magnetic targeting nanocarrier loaded with a PPARγ agonist (15d-PGJ2-MNPs) is synthesized, which could be magnetically targeted and enriched in the area of the hematoma after intravenous injection. Subsequent application of focusing ultrasound (FUS) could enhance drug diffusion, which activates the PPARγ receptors on macrophages around the hematoma for better hematoma clearance. The 15d-PGJ2-MNP treatment alleviates brain injury, accelerates hematoma clearance, attenuates neuroinflammation, reduces brain edema and significantly improves the deficits in sensory and motor function and spatial learning ability in the ICH mouse model. This work proposes an effective magnetic targeting plus FUS method to treat ICH, highlighting its great potential in the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke.",1
"Objective.High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can induce thermal and mechanical mechanisms in a well-defined focal volume of tissues. Histotripsy is a form of mechanical HIFU that can initiate and interact with bubble(s) to cause shock scattering and perhaps atomization within the bubble(s) to fractionate most soft tissues. Ultrasonic atomization, or the ejection of fine droplets from an acoustically-excited liquid exposed to air, has been shown to erode planar soft tissue surfaces, which has led to theories that atomization is a mechanism in histotripsy. However, healthy tendons show resistance to conventional histotripsy; pre-treatment of tendons with heat increases susceptibility to histotripsy fractionation. This study investigates ultrasonic atomization and erosion from planar healthy and tendinopathic tendon surfaces as we evaluate HIFU parameters for histotripsy in tendons.Approach.Forty-sixex vivobovine tendon-air interfaces were pre-conditioned to surface wetting, heat baths of 20 °C (unaltered), 37 °C (body temperature), and 58 °C (collagen degradation), collagenase soaks for 1, 3, 5, and 24 h (mimicking tendinopathic tendons), and phosphate buffered saline soaks for 24 h. Ejected fragments, histology, and gross analysis determined erosion success. Tissue displacement from the HIFU radiation force was monitored with high-speed photography, and tissue relaxation was pixel-tracked and fit to a Kelvin-Voigt model to evaluate changes in viscoelastic properties.Main results.Results showed that atomization produced holes in 24 h collagenase tendons and surface pitting in 58 °C, 3 h, and 5 h collagenase tendons. Increased mound heights and viscoelastic constants in pre-heated (to 58 °C) and collagenase-soaking (3+ hours) tendinopathic models caused a decrease in elasticity and/or increase in viscosity, increasing susceptibility to erosion by HIFU atomization.Significance.Therefore, tendons with chronic tendinopathies may be more susceptible than healthy tendons to histotripsy fractionation.",1
"PURPOSE: To determine efficacy and safety of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation of uterine fibroids (UFs). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed women undergoing HIFU ablation for UFs between June 2018 and January 2020. Before and after HIFU, patients underwent CEUS and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. The relationship between CEUS features and ablation rate was analyzed. The time-intensity curves on CEUS were measured before and after HIFU ablation, and compared with those obtained using MRI. Adverse reactions were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included. The immediate HIFU ablation rate significantly differed between low-, iso-, and high-enhancement UFs (87.2% ± 1.6%, 83.3% ± 2.1%, and 72.9% ± 3.1%, respectively; p < 0.05). On CEUS, the peak time of the time-intensity curve was significantly longer after treatment than before treatment (32.2 ± 9.7 and 26.7 ± 9.4 s, respectively; p < 0.05). Peak intensity was significantly lower after treatment than before treatment (13.7 ± 7.5 and 30.9 ± 11.2 dB, respectively; p < 0.05). All measurements were comparable between CEUS and MRI. The most common peri- and post-procedure adverse reaction was pain, which was temporary. CONCLUSION: CEUS could dynamically and safely evaluate the immediate effects of the HIFU ablation of UFs.",1
"AIM: To study the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters in predicting the efficacy of ultrasonic ablation of fibroids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 91 patients were divided into groups based on non-perfused volume (NPV) ratio and blood supply type. The preoperative MRI parameters were measured and analysed. A correlation analysis between the MRI parameters and the NPV ratio was performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyse and determine the cut-off value of MRI parameters to predict the ablation rate of fibroids. RESULTS: The uterine fibroids group with an NPV ratio <80% and the group with an NPV ratio of ≥80% had significant differences in signal intensity (SI) at MRI T2-weighted imaging (WI), fibroid-to-rectus abdominis SI ratio (SIR) at T2WI, and blood supply type (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in fibroid volume, T2WI signal uniformity, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. The ADC value and SI and SIR at MRI T2WI in the group with poor blood supply were lower than those in the group with a rich blood supply (p<0.05). SI at MRI T2WI correlated negatively with the NPV ratio. The cut-off values for SI and SIR at MRI T2WI of fibroids whose NPV ratio exceeds 80% were 220.58 and 1.315, respectively. CONCLUSION: SI at MRI T2WI and blood supply type could be predictors of the efficacy of ablation. Ultrasonic ablation of fibroids with MRI T2WI hyperintensity and a rich blood supply had poor efficacy.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in healthy women. High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a modern, noninvasive thermal ablation method for treating uterine fibroids. There is increasing evidence that ultrasound guided HIFU (US-HIFU) has no adverse impact on ovarian reserve but little data exists on magnetic resonance guided HIFU (MR-HIFU). There are different options to estimate ovarian reserve, perhaps the most reliable being the measurement of serum Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-four (74) premenopausal women with serum AMH 0.1 ug/L or over, aged 24-48 and with fibroids or adenomyosis treated with MR-HIFU were enrolled in our study. AMH levels were analyzed before and 3 months after the MR-HIFU treatment. Correlations between AMH level changes and position of fibroids, fibroid volume, non-perfused volume ratio, and treatment energies were studied. RESULTS: The median AMH level before the HIFU treatment was 1.20 (range: 0.1-7.75 ug/L) and after the treatment 1.23 (range: 0.1-8.51 ug/L). No significant change was detected (p = .90). The patients were divided in three subgroups depending on the baseline AMH levels. The changes were not significant in any of the subgroups. Neither did the location of the treated fibroid affect the change of AMH levels nor the total energy used during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MR-HIFU does not compromise the ovarian reserve. Neither the location of the treated fibroid nor the total energy used during MR-HIFU had any effect on the change of AMH levels.",1
"OBJECTIVES: To determine the value of dual-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics in predicting the efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation for hysteromyoma. METHODS: A total of 142 patients with 172 hysteromyomas (95 hysteromyomas from the sufficient ablation group, and 77 hysteromyomas from the insufficient ablation group) were enrolled in the study. The clinical-radiological model was constructed with independent clinical-radiological risk factors, the radiomics model was constructed based on the optimal radiomics features of hysteromyoma from dual sequences, and the two groups of features were incorporated to construct the combined model. A fivefold cross validation procedure was adopted to validate these models. A nomogram was constructed, applying the combined model in the training cohort. The models were assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). An independent test cohort comprising 40 patients was used to evaluate the performance of the optimal model. RESULTS: Among the three models, the average areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of the radiomics model and combined model were 0.803 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.726-0.881) and 0.841 (95% CI: 0.772-0.909), which were better than the clinical-radiological model in the training cohort. The IDI showed that the combined model had the best prediction accuracy. The combined model also showed good discrimination in both the validation cohort (AUC = 0.834) and the independent test cohort (AUC = 0.801). CONCLUSION: The combined model based on the dual-sequence MRI radiomics is the most promising tool from our study to assist clinicians in predicting HIFU ablation efficacy.",1
"BACKGROUND: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is used for the treatment of symptomatic leiomyomas. We aim to automate uterine volumetry for tracking changes after therapy with a 3D deep learning approach. METHODS: A 3D nnU-Net model in the default setting and in a modified version including convolutional block attention modules (CBAMs) was developed on 3D T2-weighted MRI scans. Uterine segmentation was performed in 44 patients with routine pelvic MRI (standard group) and 56 patients with uterine fibroids undergoing ultrasound-guided HIFU therapy (HIFU group). Here, preHIFU scans (n = 56), postHIFU imaging maximum one day after HIFU (n = 54), and the last available follow-up examination (n = 53, days after HIFU: 420 ± 377) were included. The training was performed on 80% of the data with fivefold cross-validation. The remaining data were used as a hold-out test set. Ground truth was generated by a board-certified radiologist and a radiology resident. For the assessment of inter-reader agreement, all preHIFU examinations were segmented independently by both. RESULTS: High segmentation performance was already observed for the default 3D nnU-Net (mean Dice score = 0.95 ± 0.05) on the validation sets. Since the CBAM nnU-Net showed no significant benefit, the less complex default model was applied to the hold-out test set, which resulted in accurate uterus segmentation (Dice scores: standard group 0.92 ± 0.07; HIFU group 0.96 ± 0.02), which was comparable to the agreement between the two readers. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a method for automatic uterus segmentation which allows a fast and consistent assessment of uterine volume. Therefore, this method could be used in the clinical setting for objective assessment of therapeutic response to HIFU therapy.",1
"OBJECTIVES: To compare pregnancy outcomes after high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation (HIFU), myomectomy and uterine artery embolization (UAE) for fertility-sparing patients with uterine fibroids and to investigate the possible mechanism of improving pregnancy by HIFU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis of 54 studies containing 12,367 patients was conducted to compare the pregnancy outcomes of three fertility-sparing therapies. And a retrospective self-control study of 26 patients with uterine fibroids from May 2019 to December 2020 was performed to assess the blood flow impedance of bilateral uterine arteries before and after HIFU. RESULTS: In the analysis by treatment option, the pregnancy rate after myomectomy was 0.43 (95% CI 0.36-0.49), which was higher than 0.18 (95% CI 0.10-0.26) after HIFU, the latter was significantly higher than that after UAE (ratio 0.08, 95% CI 0.06-0.10). The miscarriage rate after HIFU was 0.08 (95% CI 0.04-0.12), which was similar to 0.15 (95% CI 0.09-0.21) after myomectomy and also similar to 0.16 after UAE (95% CI 0.01-0.30). In the subgroup analysis, women who received ultrasound guided HIFU (USgHIFU) were more likely to have ideal pregnancy outcomes than that after magnetic resonance imaging-guided HIFU. The pulsatility index and resistance index on the right side were significantly higher 3 months after HIFU than before (1.637 ± 0.435 vs. 1.845 ± 0.469; p = 0.033; 0.729 ± 0.141 vs. 0.784 ± 0.081, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: HIFU, especially USgHIFU, may be an alternative fertility-sparing modality for patients with uterine fibroids over 40 years old. HIFU may contribute to improving pregnancy rates by elevating uterine blood flow impedance.",1
"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) for the treatment of an adenomyosis model of Bama pigs and the changes in the level of oxytocin receptor (OTR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the myometrium tissues of Bama pigs after MRgFUS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three Bama pig models of adenomyosis were established by autologous endometrial implantation and evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. After the successful construction of the model, the pigs underwent MRgFUS. Before the modeling surgery, three months after the modeling, and two months after ablation, the myometrium tissues were clipped, then embedded and H&E stained for immunohistochemical examination. The average optical density of OTR, VEGF, and COX-2 were semi-quantitatively analyzed. RESULTS: The adenomyosis models were established in all Bama pigs and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and H&E staining. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography examination showed that the uterine wall at the modeling site was significantly thickened with uneven enhancement after contrast injection. All Bama pigs with adenomyosis lesions underwent MRgFUS without complications. The expression level of OTR and COX-2 in the myometrium increased three months after modeling surgery and decreased two months after MRgFUS. The expression level of VEGF decreased two months after MRgFUS. CONCLUSION: Autologous endometrial implantation is effective in establishing the adenomyosis model of Bama pigs. It is feasible to treat adenomyosis in the Bama pig model with MRgFUS. The levels of OTR, COX-2 and VEGF in the local myometrium decreased after MRgFUS, which may be associated with symptom relief after treatment.",1
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of the combination of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), mifepristone, and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in adenomyosis treatment. METHODS: HIFU treatment was performed in 123 patients with symptomatic adenomyosis who had refused treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) at Anyang Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital. In the control group, 34 patients were treated with HIFU alone, 29 patients with HIFU combined with mifepristone, 10 patients with HIFU combined with LNG-IUS. In the study group, 50 patients were treated with HIFU combined with mifepristone and LNG-IUS. RESULTS: Uterine volume, dysmenorrhea pain score, menstruation volume score, and serum CA125 level were significantly lower after treatment with HIFU combined with mifepristone and LNG-IUS than before treatment (p < .05). Moreover, hemoglobin level was significantly higher than that before treatment (p < .05). After 24 months, the efficacy of HIFU combined with mifepristone and LNG-IUS was significantly higher than that of HIFU alone, HIFU combined with mifepristone or HIFU with LNG-IUS (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy of HIFU, mifepristone, and LNG-IUS is an effective, safe, and inexpensive treatment for patients with symptomatic adenomyosis. This combination therapy demonstrates superior efficacy to treatment with HIFU alone, HIFU combined with mifepristone, and HIFU combined with LNG-IUS.",1
"In view of the fact that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents the transport of imaging probes and therapeutic agents to the brain and thus hinders the diagnosis and treatment of brain-related disorders, methods of circumventing this problem (e.g., ultrasound-mediated nanoparticle delivery) have drawn much attention. Among the related techniques, focused ultrasound (FUS) is a favorite means of enhancing drug delivery via transient BBB opening. Photoacoustic brain imaging relies on the conversion of light into heat and the detection of ultrasound signals from contrast agents, offering the benefits of high resolution and large penetration depth. The extensive versatility and adjustable physicochemical properties of nanoparticles make them promising therapeutic agents and imaging probes, allowing for successful brain imaging and treatment through the combined action of ultrasound and nanoparticulate agents. FUS-induced BBB opening enables nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems to efficiently access the brain. Moreover, photoacoustic brain imaging using nanoparticle-based contrast agents effectively visualizes brain morphologies or diseases. Herein, we review the progress in the simultaneous use of nanoparticles and ultrasound in brain research, revealing the potential of ultrasound-mediated nanoparticle delivery for the effective diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Port wine birthmark, also known as port wine stain (PWS) is a skin discoloration characterized by red/purple patches caused by vascular malformation. PWS is typically treated by using lasers to destroy abnormal blood vessels. The laser heating facilitates selective photothermolysis of the vessels and attenuates quickly in the tissue due to high optical scattering. Therefore, residual abnormal capillaries deep in the tissue survive and often lead to the resurgence of PWS. Ultrasound (US) has also been proposed to treat PWS, however, it is nonselective with respect to the vasculature but penetrates deeper into the tissue. We aim to study the feasibility of a hybrid PWS treatment modality combining the advantages of both modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this manuscript, we propose a photoacoustic (PA) guided US focusing methodology for PWS treatment which combines the optical contrast-based selectivity with US penetration to focus the US energy onto the vasculature. The PA signals collected by the transducers, when time-reversed, amplified, and transmitted, converge onto the PWS, thus minimally affecting the neighboring tissue. We performed two- and three-dimensional simulations that mimic realistic transducers and medium properties in this proof of concept study. RESULTS: The time-reversed PA signals when transmitted from the transducers converged onto the vasculature, as expected, thus reducing the heating of the neighboring tissue. We observed that while the US focus is indeed affected due to experimental factors such as limited-view, large detector separation and finite detection bandwidth, and so forth, the US did focus completely or partially onto the vasculature demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed methodology. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology for PWS treatment. This treatment method can destroy the deeper capillaries while minimally heating the neighboring tissue, thus reducing the chances of the resurgence of PWS and as well as cosmetic scarring.",0
"Nanomedicine has revolutionized the available treatment options during the last decade, but poor selectivity of targeted drug delivery and release is still poses a challenge. In this study, doxorubicin (DOX) and magnetite nanoparticles were encapsulated by freezing-induced loading, coated with polymeric shell bearing two bi-layers of polyarginine/dextran sulphate and finally modified with HER2-specific DARPin proteins. We demonstrated that the enhanced cellular uptake of these nanocarriers predominantly occurs by SKOV-3 (HER2+) cells, in comparison to CHO (HER2-) cells, together with the controlled DOX release using low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU). In addition, a good ability of DARPin+ capsules to accumulate in the tumor and the possibility of combination therapy with LIFU were demonstrated. A relatively high sensitivity of the obtained nanocarriers to LIFU and their preferential interactions with mitochondria in cancer cells make these carriers promising candidates for cancer treatment, including novel approaches to overcome drug resistance.",0
"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging with high spatial resolution has great potential as desired monitoring means in the high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) surgery of tumor. However, its penetration depth in the tissue is insufficient for achieving accurate intraoperative navigation, leading to residual tumor tissue. Nanomedicine provides a new opportunity for PA imaging to guide HIFU surgery. Studies have found that the hypoxic heterogeneity of tumor is effectively reversed by HIFU. Herein, a specific metal-organic framework nanosystem, constructed by coordination of banoxantrone (AQ4N) and Mn2+ , is designed based on HIFU to reverse the hypoxic heterogeneity of tumors. It can provide exogenous light-absorbing substances, thus improving the penetrability of PA imaging signal through the deep tissue and achieving clearer PA imaging for guiding HIFU surgery. In turn, AQ4N, in the hypoxic homogenous environment of the tumor provided by HIFU, is activated sequentially to specifically treat the residual hypoxic tumor cells. This combination treatment manifests higher tumor suppressors activation and lower expression of genes related to tumor progression. This strategy addresses the dissatisfaction with PA imaging-guided HIFU therapy and is promising for translation into a clinical combination regimen.",0
"BACKGROUND: Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has gained considerable attention as a promising noninvasive neuromodulatory technique for human brains. However, the complex morphology of the skull hinders scholars from precisely predicting the acoustic energy transmitted and the region of the brain impacted during the sonication. This is due to the fact that different ultrasound frequencies and skull morphology variations greatly affect wave propagation through the skull. PURPOSE: Although the acoustic properties of human skull have been studied for tFUS applications, such as tumor ablation using a multielement phased array, there is no consensus about how to choose a single-element focused ultrasound (FUS) transducer with a suitable frequency for neuromodulation. There are interests in exploring the magnitude and dimension of tFUS beam through human parietal bone for modulating specific brain lobes. Herein, we aim to investigate the wave propagation of tFUS on human skulls to understand and address the concerns above. METHODS: Both experimental measurements and numerical modeling were conducted to investigate the transmission efficiency and beam pattern of tFUS on five human skulls (C3 and C4 regions) using single-element FUS transducers with six different frequencies (150-1500 kHz). The degassed skull was placed in a water tank, and a calibrated hydrophone was utilized to measure acoustic pressure past it. The cranial computed tomography scan data of each skull were obtained to derive a high-resolution acoustic model (grid point spacing: 0.25 mm) in simulations. Meanwhile, we modified the power-law exponent of acoustic attenuation coefficient to validate numerical modeling and enabled it to be served as a prediction tool, based on the experimental measurements. RESULTS: The transmission efficiency and -6 dB beamwidth were evaluated and compared for various frequencies. An exponential decrease in transmission efficiency and a logarithmic decrease of -6 dB beamwidth with an increase in ultrasound frequency were observed. It is found that a >750 kHz ultrasound leads to a relatively lower tFUS transmission efficiency (<5%), whereas a <350 kHz ultrasound contributes to a relatively broader beamwidth (>5 mm). Based on these observations, we further analyzed the dependence of tFUS wave propagation on FUS transducer aperture size. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully studied tFUS wave propagation through human skulls at different frequencies experimentally and numerically. The findings have important implications to predict tFUS wave propagation for ultrasound neuromodulation in clinical applications, and guide researchers to develop advanced ultrasound transducers as neural interfaces.",0
"The role of interventional radiology (IR) is expanding. With new techniques being developed and tested, this radiology subspecialty is taking a step forward in different clinical scenarios, especially in oncology. Musculoskeletal tumoral diseases would definitely benefit from a low-invasive approach that could reduce mortality and morbidity in particular. Thermal ablation through IR has already become important in the palliation and consolidation of bone metastases, oligometastatic disease, local recurrences, and treating specific benign tumors, with a more tailored approach, considering the characteristics of every patient. As image-guided ablation techniques lower their invasiveness and increase their efficacy while the collateral effects and complications decrease, they become more relevant and need to be considered in patient care pathways and clinical management, to improve outcomes. We present a literature review of the different percutaneous and non-invasive image-guided thermal ablation methods that are currently available and that could in the future become relevant to manage musculoskeletal oncologic diseases.",0
"We investigate the role of leaky guided waves in transcranial ultrasound transmission in temporal and parietal bones at large incidence angles. Our numerical and experimental results show that the dispersion characteristics of the fundamental leaky guided wave mode with longitudinal polarization can be leveraged to estimate the critical angle above which efficient shear mode conversion takes place, and below which major transmission drops can be expected. Simulations that employ a numerical propagator matrix and a Semi-Analytical approach establish the transcranial dispersion characteristics and transmission coefficients at different incident angles. Experimental transmission tests conducted at 500 kHz and radiation tests performed in the 200-800 kHz range confirm the numerical findings in terms of transmitted peak pressure and frequency-radiation angle spectra, based on which the connection between critical angles, dispersion and transmission is demonstrated. Our results support the identification of transcranial ultrasound strategies that leverage shear mode conversion, which is less sensitive to phase aberrations compared to normal incidence ultrasound. These findings can also enable higher transmission rates in cranial bones with low porosity by leveraging dispersion information extracted through signal processing, without requiring measurement of geometric and mechanical properties of the cranial bone.",0
"BACKGROUND: The size of catheter-based ultrasound devices for delivering ultrasound energy to deep-seated tumors is constrained by the access pathway which limits their therapeutic capabilities. PURPOSE: To devise and investigate a deployable applicator suitable for minimally-invasive delivery of therapeutic ultrasound, consisting of a 2D cylindrical sectored-ring ultrasound phased array, integrated within an expandable paraboloid-shaped balloon-based reflector. The balloon can be collapsed for compact delivery and expanded close to the target position to mimic a larger-diameter concentric-ring sector-vortex array for enhanced dynamic control of focal depth and volume. METHODS: Acoustic and biothermal simulations were employed in 3D generalized homogeneous and patient-specific heterogeneous models, for three-phased array transducers with 32, 64, and 128 elements, composed of sectored 4, 8, and 16 tubular ring transducers, respectively. The applicator performance was characterized as a function of array configuration, focal depth, phasing modes, and balloon reflector geometry. A 16-element proof-of-concept phased array applicator assembly, consisting of four tubular transducers each divided into four sectors, was fabricated, and characterized with hydrophone measurements along and across the axis, and ablations in ex vivo tissue. RESULTS: Simulation results indicated that transducer arrays (1.5 MHz, 9 mm OD × 20 mm long), balloon sizes (41-50 mm expanded diameter, 20-60 mm focal depth), phasing mode (0-4) and sonication duration (30 s) can produce spatially localized acoustic intensity focal patterns (focal length: 3-22 mm, focal width: 0.7-8.7 mm) and ablative thermal lesions (width: 2.7-16 mm, length: 6-46 mm) in pancreatic tissue across a 10-90 mm focal depth range. Patient-specific studies indicated that 0.1, 0.46, and 1.2 cm3 volume of tumor can be ablated in the body of the pancreas for 120 s sonications using a single axial focus (Mode 0), or four, and eight simultaneous foci in a toroidal pattern (Mode 2 and 4, respectively). Hydrophone measurements demonstrated good agreement with simulation. Experiments in which chicken meat was thermally ablated indicated that volumetric ablation can be produced using single or multiple foci. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of a novel compact ultrasound applicator design capable of focusing, deep penetration, electronic steering, and volumetric thermal ablation. The proposed applicator can be used for compact endoluminal or laparoscopic delivery of localized ultrasound energy to deep-seated targets.",0
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer acoustic output can vary over time as a result of an inconsistent power supply, damage to the transducer or deterioration over time. Therefore, easy implementation of a daily quality assurance (DQA) method is of great importance for pre-clinical research and clinical applications. We present here a thermochromic material-based phantom validated by thermal simulations and found to provide repeatable visual power output assessments in fewer than 15 s that are accurate to within 10%. Whereas current available methods such as radiation force balance measurements provide an estimate of the total acoustic power, we explain here that the thermochromic phantom is sensitive to the shape of the acoustic field at focus by changing the aperture of a multi-element transducer with a fixed acoustic power. The proposed phantom allows the end user to visually assess the transducer's functionality without resorting to expensive, time-consuming hydrophone measurements or image analysis.",0
"Transcranial focused shockwave (FSW) is a novel noninvasive brain stimulation that can open blood-brain barriers (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers (BCSFB) with a single low-energy (energy flux density 0.03 mJ/mm2) pulse and low-dose microbubbles (2 × 106/kg). Similar to focused ultrasound, FSW deliver highly precise stimulation of discrete brain regions with adjustable focal lengths that essentially covers the whole brain. By opening the BCSFB, it allows for rapid widespread drug delivery to the whole brain by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation. Although no definite adverse effect or permeant injury was noted in our previous study, microscopic hemorrhage was infrequently observed. Safety concerns remain the major obstacle to further application of FSW in brain. To enhance its applicability, a modified single pulse FSW technique was established that present 100% opening rate but much less risk of adverse effect than previous methods. By moving the targeting area 2.5 mm more superficially on the left lateral ventricle as compared with the previous methods, the microscopic hemorrhage rate was reduced to zero. We systemically examine the safety profiles of the modified FSW-BCSFB opening regarding abnormal behavior and brain injury or hemorrhage 72 hr after 0, 1, and 10 pulses of FSW-treatment. Animal behavior, physiological monitor, and brain MRI were examined and recorded. Brain section histology was examined for hemorrhage, apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress related immunohistochemistry and biomarkers. The single pulse FSW group demonstrated no mortality or gross/microscopic hemorrhage (N = 30), and no observable changes in all examined outcomes, while 10 pulses of FSW was found to be associated with microscopic and temporary RBC extravasation (N = 6/30), and abnormal immunohistochemistry biomarkers which showed a trend of recovery at 72 hrs. The results suggest that single pulse low-energy FSW-BCSFB opening is effective, safe and poses minimal risk of injury to brain tissue (Sprague Dawley, SD rats).",0
"Rationale: Focused ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles have been shown to be capable of inducing blood flow shutdown and necrosis in a range of tissue types in an approach termed antivascular ultrasound or nonthermal ablation. In oncology, this approach has demonstrated tumor growth inhibition, and profound synergistic antitumor effects when combined with traditional platforms of chemo-, radiation- and immune-therapies. However, the exposure schemes employed have been broad and underlying mechanisms remain unclear with fundamental questions about exposures, vessel types and sizes involved, and the nature of bubble behaviors and their acoustic emissions resulting in vascular damage - impeding the establishment of standard protocols. Methods: Here, ultrasound transmitters and receivers are integrated into a murine dorsal window chamber tumor model for intravital microscopy studies capable of real-time visual and acoustic monitoring during antivascular ultrasound. Vessel type (normal and tumor-affected), caliber, and viability are assessed under higher pressure conditions (1, 2, and 3 MPa), and cavitation signatures are linked to the biological effects. Results: Vascular events occurred preferentially in tumor-affected vessels with greater incidence in smaller vessels and with more severity as a function of increasing pressure. Vascular blood flow shutdown was found to be due to a combination of focal disruption events and network-related flow changes. Acoustic emissions displayed elevated broadband noise and distinct sub- and ultra-harmonics and their associated third-order peaks with increasing pressure. Conclusions: The observed vascular events taken collectively with identified cavitation signatures provide an improved mechanistic understanding of antivascular ultrasound at the microscale, with implications for establishing a specific treatment protocol and control platform.",0
"Objective.The aim of the paper is to propose an all-in-one method based on magnetic resonance-supersonic shear wave imaging (MR-SSI) and proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) to monitor high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) thermal ablations.Approach.Mechanical properties have been shown to be related to tissue damage induced by thermal ablations. Monitoring elasticity in addition to temperature changes may help in ensuring the efficacy and the accuracy of HIFU therapies. For this purpose, an MR-SSI method has been developed where the ultrasonic transducer is used for both mechanical wave generation and thermal ablation. Transient quasi-planar shear waves are generated using the acoustic radiation force, and their propagation is monitored in motion-sensitized phase MR images. Using a single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar-imaging sequence, MR images can be acquired at a sufficiently high temporal resolution to provide an update of PRFS thermometry and MR-SSI elastography maps in real time.Main results.The proposed method was first validated on a calibrated elasticity phantom, in which both the possibility to detect inclusions with different stiffness and repeatability were demonstrated. The standard deviation between the 8 performed measurements was 2% on the background of the phantom and 11%, at most, on the inclusions. A second experiment consisted in performing a HIFU heating in a gelatin phantom. The temperature increase was estimated to be 9 °C and the shear modulus was found to decrease from 2.9 to 1.8 kPa, reflecting the gel softening around the HIFU focus, whereas it remained steady in non-heated areas.Significance.The proposed MR-SSI technique allows monitoring HIFU ablations using thermometry and elastography simultaneously, without the need for an additional external mechanical exciter such as those used in MR elastography.",0
"Optogenetics has revolutionized neuroscience understanding by allowing spatiotemporal control over cell-type specific neurons in neural circuits. However, the sluggish development of noninvasive photon delivery in the brain has limited the clinical application of optogenetics. Focused ultrasound (FUS)-derived mechanoluminescence has emerged as a promising tool for in situ photon emission, but there is not yet a biocompatible liquid-phase mechanoluminescence system for spatiotemporal optogenetics. To achieve noninvasive optogenetics with a high temporal resolution and desirable biocompatibility, we have developed liposome (Lipo@IR780/L012) nanoparticles for FUS-triggered mechanoluminescence in brain photon delivery. Synchronized and stable blue light emission was generated in solution under FUS irradiation due to the cascade reactions in liposomes. In vitro tests revealed that Lipo@IR780/L012 could be triggered by FUS for light emission at different stimulation frequencies, resulting in activation of opsin-expressing spiking HEK cells under the FUS irradiation. In vivo optogenetic stimulation further demonstrated that motor cortex neurons could be noninvasively and reversibly activated under the repetitive FUS irradiation after intravenous injection of lipid nanoparticles to achieve limb movements.",0
"Ultrasound represents a wireless and non-contact route for energy delivery and device control, owing to its ability to propagate and focus in various mediums including biological tissue. Specifically, ultrasound-activated mechanoluminescence from a colloidal suspension of mechanoluminescent (ML) nanocrystals offers a wireless means to remotely control a light source, such as wirelessly addressing a multicolor display. However, the limited color purity and tunability, as well as the large sizes of conventional ML materials prevent their use in an ultrasound-mediated flexible color display. Here, we apply a biomineral-inspired suppressed dissolution approach to synthesize ML colloids with bright blue emission under ultrasound and small sizes down to 20 nm. In addition, we leverage the bandgap engineering strategy of all-inorganic perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) to achieve wavelength tunability of the mechanoluminescence of ML colloid/PQD composites. Remarkably, the ultrasound-activated emission of the ML colloid/PQD composites exhibits a highly saturated color gamut covering the entire visible spectrum. Based on these advantages, we assembled a pixel array composed of different ML colloid/PQD composites in a silicone elastomer and demonstrated the proof-of-concept of a flexible and wireless multicolor display with each pixel individually addressed by scanning focused ultrasound.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Unilateral Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound subthalamotomy (FUS-STN) has been shown to improve the cardinal motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD). Whether this effect is sustained is not known. This study aims to report the long-term outcome of PD patients treated with unilateral FUS-STN. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, open-label study of asymmetrical PD patients who underwent unilateral FUS-STN. All patients were evaluated up to 36 months after treatment. The primary outcome was the difference from baseline to 36 months after FUS-STN in the score of the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Rating scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor part (III) for the treated hemibody in the off-medication state. The safety outcome included all adverse events occurring during follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the change in the MDS-UPDRS III score on-medication; sub-scores of rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and axial features; total MDS-UPDRS III; and the MDS-UPDRS part IV. Functional disability and quality of life were assessed using the MDS-UPDRS II and the PDQ39, respectively. Patient impression of change and satisfaction with the treatment were self-assessed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test with subsequent Bonferroni's correction was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-two PD patients were evaluated 36 months after treatment. The mean (±SD) age at baseline was 56.0±10.1 years, with a mean disease duration of 6.8±2.8 years. The MDS-UPDRS III score for the treated hemibody off-medication was improved by 52.3% from baseline to 3 years (score reduction from 19.0±3.2 to 8.9±3.3, 95% confidence interval [95CI] 8.7 to 11.6, P<0.001), and all specific motor features were improved from baseline. No disabling or delayed adverse events were reported. The total MDS-UPDRS III off-medication score was 22.9% lower at 3 years than before treatment (36.8±7.4 vs 27.4±6.2, 95CI 6.0 to 11.5, P<0.001). The MDS-UPDRS II, IV, and PDQ39 scores and levodopa dose were equivalent to those at baseline. DISCUSSION: The benefit of unilateral FUS-STN on PD motor features is sustained in the long term. FUS-STN contributes to better clinical control over several years of evolution. NCT02912871/03454425. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence on the utility of focused ultrasound unilateral subthalamotomy in the treatment of people with Parkinson's disease.",0
"Luminol is a classic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) luminophore. The luminol-O2 ECL system suffers from a problem, that is, the conversion rate of dissolved O2 into reactive oxygen species (ROS) is low. In this work, we used high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) pretreatment combined with Ti3C2-TiO2 to construct a highly sensitive luminol-O2 ECL system for the specific detection of polynucleotide kinase (PNK) first. On the one hand, HIFU generated ROS in situ as a coreactant via the cavitation effect to boost the luminol emission. On the other hand, Ti3C2-TiO2 was prepared in situ via Ti3C2 as a reducing agent, and it can aggregate and catalyze ROS generated in situ by HIFU. Moreover, the Ti on the Ti3C2-TiO2 surface could bind to phosphate groups through chelation, thereby realizing highly specific detection of PNK. The sensor has a linear relationship range of 1.0 × 10-5 to 10.0 U mL-1, and the limit of detection is 1.48 × 10-7 U mL-1, which is superior to most existing methods. The sensor performance in HeLa cell lysate was measured with a satisfactory result. The designed ECL biosensor has potential applications in biological analysis and clinical diagnosis.",0
"Thermal ablation procedures, such as high intensity focused ultrasound and radiofrequency ablation, are often used to eliminate tumors by minimally invasively heating a focal region. For this task, real-time 3D temperature visualization is key to target the diseased tissues while minimizing damage to the surroundings. Current computed tomography (CT) thermometry is based on energy-integrated CT, tissue-specific experimental data, and linear relationships between attenuation and temperature. In this paper, we develop a novel approach using photon-counting CT for material decomposition and a neural network to predict temperature based on thermal characteristics of base materials and spectral tomographic measurements of a volume of interest. In our feasibility study, distilled water, 50 mmol/L CaCl2, and 600 mmol/L CaCl2 are chosen as the base materials. Their attenuations are measured in four discrete energy bins at various temperatures. The neural network trained on the experimental data achieves a mean absolute error of 3.97 °C and 1.80 °C on 300 mmol/L CaCl2 and a milk-based protein shake respectively. These experimental results indicate that our approach is promising for handling non-linear thermal properties for materials that are similar or dissimilar to our base materials.",0
"Therapeutic focused ultrasound in combination with encapsulated microbubbles is being widely investigated for its ability to elicit bioeffects in the microvasculature, such as transient permeabilization for drug delivery or at higher pressures to achieve 'antivascular' effects. While it is well established that the behaviors of microbubbles are altered when they are situated within sufficiently small vessels, there is a paucity of data examining how the bubble population dynamics and emissions change as a function of channel (vessel) diameter over a size range relevant to therapeutic ultrasound, particularly at pressures relevant to antivascular ultrasound. Here we use acoustic emissions detection and high-speed microscopy (10 kframes/s) to examine the behavior of a polydisperse clinically employed agent (Definity®) in wall-less channels as their diameters are scaled from 1200 to 15 µm. Pressures are varied from 0.1 to 3 MPa using either a 5 ms pulse or a sequence of 0.1 ms pulses spaced at 1 ms, both of which have been previously employed in an in vivo context. With increasing pressure, the 1200 µm channel - on the order of small arteries and veins - exhibited inertial cavitation, 1/2 subharmonics and 3/2 ultraharmonics, consistent with numerous previous reports. The 200 and 100 µm channels - in the size range of larger microvessels less affected by therapeutic focused ultrasound - exhibited a distinctly different behavior, having muted development of 1/2 subharmonics and 3/2 ultraharmonics and reduced persistence. These were associated with radiation forces displacing bubbles to the distal wall and inducing clusters that then rapidly dissipated along with emissions. As the diameter transitioned to 50 and then 15 µm - a size regime that is most relevant to therapeutic focused ultrasound - there was a higher threshold for the onset of inertial cavitation as well as subharmonics and ultraharmonics, which importantly had more complex orders that are not normally reported. Clusters also occurred in these channels (e.g. at 3 MPa, the mean lateral and axial sizes were 23 and 72 µm in the 15 µm channel; 50 and 90 µm in the 50 µm channel), however in this case they occupied the entire lumens and displaced the wall boundaries. Damage to the 15 µm channel was observed for both pulse types, but at a lower pressure for the long pulse. Experiments conducted with a 'nanobubble' (<0.45 µm) subpopulation of Definity followed broadly similar features to 'native' Definity, albeit at a higher pressure threshold for inertial cavitation. These results provide new insights into the behavior of microbubbles in small vessels at higher pressures and have implications for therapeutic focused ultrasound cavitation monitoring and control.",0
"BACKGROUND: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has shown considerable promise in treating solid tumors, but its ultrasonic energy is easily attenuated, resulting in insufficient energy accumulation in the target area. Moreover, HIFU ablation alone may inevitably lead to the presence of residual tumors, which may cause tumor recurrence and metastasis. Here, we describe a synergistic regimen combining HIFU facilitation with immunomodulation based on a novel oxygen-carrying biomimetic perfluorocarbon nanoparticle (M@P-SOP) to stimulate immunogenic cell death in tumor cells while alleviating immune suppression tumor microenvironment. METHODS: M@P-SOP was prepared by double emulsion and film extrusion method. The anticancer and antimetastatic effects of M@P-SOP were evaluated on a preclinical transplanted 4T1 tumor model by combining HIFU and immunotherapy. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to clarify the potential mechanism of HIFU+M@P-SOP and their role in anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) therapy. RESULTS: Guided by photoacoustic/MR/ultrasound (US) multimodal imaging, M@P-SOP was abundantly enriched in tumor, which greatly enhanced HIFU's killing of tumor tissue in situ, induced stronger tumor immunogenic cell death, stimulated dendritic cell maturation and activated CD8+ T cells. At the same time, M@P-SOP released oxygen to alleviate the tumor hypoxic environment, repolarizing the protumor M2-type macrophages into antitumor M1-type. With concurrent anti-PD-L1 treatment, the antitumor immune response was further amplified to the whole body, and the growth of mimic distant tumor was effectively suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings offer a highly promising HIFU synergist for effectively ameliorating acoustic and hypoxia environment, eventually inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis by stimulating host's antitumor immunity under HIFU ablation, especially in synergizing with PD-L1 antibody immunotherapy.",0
"PURPOSE: To develop an efficient MRI pulse sequence to simultaneously measure multiple parameters that have been shown to correlate with tissue nonviability following thermal therapies. METHODS: A 3D segmented EPI pulse sequence was used to simultaneously measure proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) MR thermometry (MRT), T1 relaxation time, and shear wave velocity induced by focused ultrasound (FUS) push pulses. Experiments were performed in tissue mimicking gelatin phantoms and ex vivo bovine liver. Using a carefully designed FUS triggering scheme, a heating duty cycle of approximately 65% was achieved by interleaving FUS ablation pulses with FUS push pulses to induce shear waves in the tissue. RESULTS: In phantom studies, temperature increases measured with PRFS MRT and increases in T1 correlated with decreased shear wave velocity, consistent with material softening with increasing temperature. During ablation in ex vivo liver, temperature increase measured with PRFS MRT initially correlated with increasing T1 and decreasing shear wave velocity, and after tissue coagulation with decreasing T1 and increasing shear wave velocity. This is consistent with a previously described hysteresis in T1 versus PRFS curves and increased tissue stiffness with tissue coagulation. CONCLUSION: An efficient approach for simultaneous and dynamic measurements of PRSF, T1 , and shear wave velocity during treatment is presented. This approach holds promise for providing co-registered dynamic measures of multiple parameters, which correlates to tissue nonviability during and following thermal therapies, such as FUS.",0
"OBJECTIVE: to systematically review the efficacy of microfocused ultrasound (MFU) for facial skin tightening. METHODS: A systematic search was performed (Pubmed, Embase) to assess the efficacy of single MFU treatments for facial skin tightening. Eligible studies included randomised controlled trials, controlled trials, cohort studies and case series (n ≥ 10). Objective and subjective outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 693 studies were identified of which 16 studies were eligible. All the studies involved female patients. MFU is capable of tightening the skin, as observed in studies measuring the results of brow lifts (0.47-1.7 mm) and submental lifts (measured as a 26-45 mm2 reduction in the submental area on lateral photographs). Data from the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) were pooled, and the day 90 pooled subjective investigator reported scores (IGAIS) (n = 337) showed that 92% of the patients demonstrated an improvement in skin tightening and/or in wrinkle reduction which continued up to one year. Longer-term follow-up data are not available. The patient-reported pooled scores (SGAIS) (n = 81) showed that the skin improvements were mild and continued to increase from 42% (90 days) to 53% (360 days) post-treatment. The MFU treatment was moderately painful and caused transient erythema with or without oedema. Other adverse effects were rare (2%), including dysesthesia (numbness or hypersensitivity), bruising and stinging, mandibular burns, striations and contact dermatitis. Various device settings, treatment protocols and energies were applied. Excessive skin laxity and a BMI &gt; 30 were posed as relative contraindications for MFU treatment because positive results declined with an increase in laxity and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: MFU treatment is effective in tightening female patients' mildly to moderately lax facial skin. Future studies should focus on objective treatment outcomes, optimising treatment regimens and male patients.",0
"Horner's syndrome (HS), caused by lesions of the 3-neuron oculosympathetic nerve pathway (ONP), includes the triad: blepharoptosis, miosis and anhidrosis (ipsilateral with ONP damage). Thyroid-related HS represents an unusual entity underling thyroid nodules/goiter/cancer-HS (T-HS), and post-thyroidectomy HS (Tx-HS). We aim to overview Tx-HS. This is a narrative review. We revised PubMed published, full-length, English papers from inception to November 2022. Additionally, we introduced data on post-thyroidectomy lymphocele/chylous leakage (Tx-L), and introduced a new pediatric case with both Tx-HS and Tx-L. Tx-HS: the level of statistical evidence varies from isolated case reports, studies analyzing the large panel of post-thyroidectomy complications reporting HS among the rarest side effects (as opposite to hypocalcemia), or different series of patients with HS due to various disorders, including T-HS/Tx-HS. Tx-HS is related to benign or malignant thyroid conditions, regardless the type of surgery. A pre-operatory rate of T-HS of 0.14%; a post-operatory rate of Tx-HS between 0.03% and 5% (mostly, 0.2%) are identified; a possible higher risk on endoscopic rather than open procedure is described. Incomplete HS forms, and pediatric onset are identified, too; the earliest identification is after 2 h since intervention. A progressive remission is expected in most cases within the first 2-6 months to one year. The management is mostly conservative; some used glucocorticoids and neurotrophic agents. One major pitfall is an additional contributor factor like a local compression due to post-operatory collections (hematoma, cysts, fistula, Tx-L) and their correction improves the outcome. The prognostic probably depends on the severity of cervical sympathetic chain (CSC) lesions: indirect, mild injury due to local compressive masses, intra-operatory damage of CSC like ischemia and stretching of CSC by the retractor associate HS recovery, while CSC section is irreversible. Other iatrogenic contributors to HS are: intra-operatory manipulation of parathyroid glands, thyroid microwave/radiofrequency ablation, and high-intensity focused ultrasound, and percutaneous ethanol injection into thyroid nodules. Tx-L, rarely reported (mostly &lt;0.5%, except for a ratio of 8.3% in one study), correlates with extended surgery, especially lateral/central neck dissection, and the presence of congenitally-aberrant lymphatic duct; it is, also, described after endoscopic procedures and chest-breast approach; it starts within days after surgery. Typically low-fat diet (even fasting and parental nutrition) and tube drainage are useful (as part of conservative management); some used octreotide, local sealing solutions like hypertonic glucose, Viscum album extract, n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. Re-intervention is required in severe cases due to the risk of lymphorrhoea and chylothorax. Early identification of Tx-HS and Tx-L improves the outcome. Some iatrogenic complications are inevitable and a multifactorial model of prediction is still required, also taking into consideration standardized operatory procedures, skillful intra-operatory manipulation, and close post-operatory follow-up of the patients, especially during modern era when thyroid surgery registered a massive progress allowing an early discharge of the patients.",0
"TiO2 is the most commonly used photocatalyst in water treatment. The particle size of TiO2 is an important factor that significantly influences its activity during photocatalytic degradation. In the presence of liquid, the properties of nanopowders composed of exactly the same product clearly differ according to their aggregation size. In this study, TiO2 nanoparticles with a controlled size were fabricated by focused ultrasound dispersion. The high energy generated by this system was used to control the size of TiO2 particles in the suspension. The constant high energy released by cavitation enabled the dispersion of the particles without a surfactant. The activities of the prepared TiO2 photocatalysts for methylene blue (MB) degradation were then compared. The dye degradation effect of the photocatalyst was as high as 61.7% after 10 min when the size of the powder was controlled in the solution, but it was only as high as 41.0% when the aggregation size was not controlled. Furthermore, when the TiO2 concentration exceeded a certain level, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 decreased. Controlling the size of the aggregated photocatalyst particles is, therefore, essential in water-treatment technologies utilizing TiO2 photocatalytic properties, and adjusting the TiO2 concentration is an important economic factor in this photocatalytic technology. This study contributes to the development of processes for degrading dyes, such as MB, released from wastewater into aquatic environments.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To use logistic regression to analyze the attributes underlying patients' treatment options for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) complicated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection, and identify the best benefit group of different treatment options. METHODS: Clinical data of 197 LSIL patients with HR-HPV infection between June 2009 and February 2022 were collected. According to the treatment options chosen by the patients, they were divided into the interferon, photodynamic therapy, follow-up observation, and focused ultrasound (FUS) treatment groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the influencing factors, including age, occupation, education level, maternity history, reason for encounter, route of consultation, annual personal and household income, screening for related risk factors, and identifying the best benefit group of different treatment options. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in age, education level, maternity history, reason for encounter, and annual household income (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on these five factors, indicating that age ≤35 years, high school educational level or higher, and no childbirth history were independent risk factors influencing patients' choices of FUS treatment. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the age threshold of 31 years. CONCLUSION: Age, educational level, and maternity history were independent risk factors influencing patients' choice of treatment modality for LSIL complicated with HR-HPV infection. Age ≤31 years, high school, equivalent, or higher educational level, and no childbirth yielded a higher rate of choosing FUS treatment for LSIL patients with HR-HPV infection.",0
"BACKGROUND: Combined therapy based on the effects of cascade reactions of nanoplatforms to combat specific solid tumor microenvironments is considered a cancer treatment strategy with transformative clinical value. Unfortunately, an insufficient O2 supply and the lack of a visual indication hinder further applications of most nanoplatforms for solid tumor therapy. RESULTS: A visualizable nanoplatform of liposome nanoparticles loaded with GOD, H(Gd), and PFP and grafted with the peptide tLyP-1, named tLyP-1H(Gd)-GOD@PFP, was constructed. The double-domain peptide tLyP-1 was used to specifically target and penetrate the tumor cells; then, US imaging, starvation therapy and sonodynamic therapy (SDT) were then achieved by the ultrasound (US)-activated cavitation effect under the guidance of MR/PA imaging. GOD not only deprived the glucose for starvation therapy but also produced H2O2, which in coordination with 1O2 produced by H(Gd), enable the effects of SDT to achieve a synergistic therapeutic effect. Moreover, the synergistic therapy was enhanced by O2 from PFP and low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)-accelerated redox effects of the GOD. The present study demonstrated that the nanoplatform could generate a 3.3-fold increase in ROS, produce a 1.5-fold increase in the maximum rate of redox reactions and a 2.3-fold increase in the O2 supply in vitro, and achieve significant tumor inhibition in vivo. CONCLUSION: We present a visualizable nanoplatform with tumor-penetrating ability that can be unlocked by US to overcome the current treatment problems by improving the controllability of the O2 supply, which ultimately synergistically enhanced cascade therapy.",0
"Background: Ultrasound-triggered sonodynamic therapy (SDT), as a non-invasive approach, has attracted considerable attention in a wide variety of malignant tumors and other diseases. Over the past 2 decades, the number of scientific publications on SDT has increased rapidly. However, there is still a lack of one comprehensive report that summarizes the global research trends and knowledge landscapes in the field of SDT in detail. Thus, we performed a bibliometric analysis on SDT from 2000 to 2021 to track the current hotspots and highlight future directions. Methods: We collected publications on SDT research from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The annual number of publications and citations, major contributors, popular journals, international collaborations, co-cited references and co-occurrence keywords were analyzed and visualized with CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and R-bibliometrix. Results: A total of 701 publications were included. The annual publication output increased from 5 in 2000 to 175 in 2021, and the average growth rate was 18.4%. China was the most productive country with 463 documents (66.05%), and Harbin Medical University was the most prolific institution (N = 73). Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology published the most papers related to SDT. Materials Science, and Chemistry were the research areas receiving the most interest. All the keywords were divided into four different clusters including studies on mechanisms, studies on drug delivery and nanoparticles, studies on cancer therapy, as well as studies on ultrasound and sonosensitizers. In addition to nanomaterials-related studies including nanoparticles, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, nanosheets, liposomes, microbubble and TiO2 nanoparticle, the following research directions such as immunogenic cell death, metal-organic framework, photothermal therapy, hypoxia, tumor microenvironment, chemodynamic therapy, combination therapy, tumor resistance, intensity focused ultrasound, drug delivery, and Staphylococcus aureus also deserve further attention and may continue to explode in the future. Conclusion: SDT has a bright future in the field of cancer treatment, and nanomaterials have increasingly influenced the SDT field with the development of nano-technology. Overall, this comprehensive bibliometric study was the first attempt to analyze the field of SDT, which could provide valuable references for later researchers to better understand the global research trends, hotspots and frontiers in this domain.",0
"BACKGROUND: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been developed for the treatment of skin wrinkles on the face, neck, and body. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a home-used HIFU device on wrinkles in mice based on the expression of fibrosis-related genes and proteins. METHODS: The backs of 20-week-old mice were treated with a home-used HIFU using the following probes: 4 MHz, 1.5 mm focal depth. The treated mice were compared with young mice by histological examination, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunohistochemistry. Histological examination was performed by trichrome staining. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were conducted to determine the expression of collagen types I and III, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1. RESULTS: Dermal thickness was increased after treatment with the home-used HIFU device at 30 and 60 s per day for 1 week or 30 and 60 s per day for 2 weeks on trichrome. Gene and protein expression of collagen types I and III and elastin were increased after treatment with HIFU at all options of 30 and 60 s per day for 1 week or 30 and 60 s per day for 2 weeks. Gene and protein expressions of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 were decreased after treatment with HIFU device at 30 and 60 s per day for 1 week or 30 and 60 s per day for 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: The home-used HIFU device can be an effective therapeutic modality for skin tightening.",0
"Sonosensitive perfluorocarbon F8TAC18-PFOB emulsion is under development to enhance heating, increase thermal contrast, and reduce treatment times during focused ultrasound tumor ablation of highly perfused tissue. The emulsion previously showed enhanced heating during ex vivo and in vitro studies. Experiments were designed to observe the response in additional scenarios by varying focused ultrasound conditions, emulsion concentrations, and surfactants. Most notably, changes in acoustic absorption were assessed with MR-ARFI. Phantoms were developed to have thermal, elastic, and relaxometry properties similar to those of ex vivo pig tissue. The phantoms were embedded with varying amounts of F8TAC18-PFOB emulsion or lecithin-PFOB emulsion, between about 0.0-0.3% v:w, in 0.05% v:w increments. MR-ARFI measurements were performed using a FLASH-ARFI-MRT sequence to obtain simultaneous displacement and temperature measurements. A Fabry-Perot hydrophone was utilized to observe the acoustic emissions. Susceptibility-weighted imaging and relaxometry mapping were performed to observe concentration-dependent effects. 19F diffusion-ordered spectroscopy NMR was used to measure the diffusion coefficient of perfluorocarbon droplets in a water emulsion. Increased displacement and temperature were observed with higher emulsion concentration. In semi-rigid MR-ARFI phantoms, a linear response was observed with low-duty cycle MR-ARFI sonications and a mono-exponential saturating response was observed with sustained sonications. The emulsifiers did not have a significant effect on acoustic absorption in semi-rigid gels. Stable cavitation might also contribute to enhanced heating.",0
"INTRODUCTION: With the advent of MR-guided focused ultrasound, the importance of the efficacy and safety of bilateral ventral intermediate (Vim) thalamotomy for essential tremor (ET) has increased. However, reports on bilateral Vim thalamotomy for ET remain scarce. METHODS: To review the results and complications of bilateral Vim thalamotomy for the treatment of ET in the upper extremities, we retrospectively analyzed the patients with ET who underwent bilateral Vim thalamotomy with radiofrequency (RF) thermal coagulation. As bilateral simultaneous thalamotomy can cause surgical complications, thalamotomy was performed in stages. The interval between the first and second thalamotomies was 21.3 ± 14.7 months. We evaluated the efficacy using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) before and after the first and second treatments, respectively. We also evaluated the complications before and after the first and second treatments, respectively. Moreover, we assessed the adverse events. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were included in the study. The mean follow-up period following the second thalamotomy was 29.3 ± 15.0 months. The CRST part A + B scores were 34.9 ± 9.7, 20.8 ± 7.0, and 7.4 ± 6.8 before, following the first (40.4% improvement, p < 0.0001) and second thalamotomies (78.6% improvement, p < 0.0001), respectively. Nine patients presented with prolonged adverse events, including dysarthria, dysgeusia, dysphagia, tongue numbness, unsteady gait, and postural instability at the last available evaluation. All adverse events were mild and did not interfere with the patient's daily activities. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral Vim thalamotomy with RF thermal coagulation was an effective treatment for ET in both upper extremities. Despite most possible complications being mild, additional studies with a larger sample size are required to ensure patient safety.",0
"Focused ultrasound is a treatment modality increasingly used for diverse therapeutic applications, and currently approved for several indications, including prostate cancers and uterine fibroids. But what about breast cancer? Breast cancer is the most common and deadliest cancer in women worldwide. While there are different treatment strategies available, there is a need for development of more effective and personalized modalities, with fewer side effects. Therapeutic ultrasound is such an option, and this review summarizes the state of the art in their use for the treatment of breast cancer and evaluate potentials of novel treatment approaches combining therapeutic ultrasound, immuno- and chemo-therapies.",0
"Real-time temperature monitoring is critical to the success of thermally ablative therapies. This work validates a 3D thermometry sequence with k-space field drift correction designed for use in magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound treatments for breast cancer. Fiberoptic probes were embedded in tissue-mimicking phantoms, and temperature change measurements from the probes were compared with the magnetic resonance temperature imaging measurements following heating with focused ultrasound. Precision and accuracy of measurements were also evaluated in free-breathing healthy volunteers (N = 3) under a non-heating condition. MR temperature measurements agreed closely with those of fiberoptic probes, with a 95% confidence interval of measurement difference from -2.0 °C to 1.4 °C. Field drift-corrected measurements in vivo had a precision of 1.1 ± 0.7 °C and were accurate within 1.3 ± 0.9 °C across the three volunteers. The field drift correction method improved precision and accuracy by an average of 46 and 42%, respectively, when compared to the uncorrected data. This temperature imaging sequence can provide accurate measurements of temperature change in aqueous tissues in the breast and support the use of this sequence in clinical investigations of focused ultrasound treatments for breast cancer.",0
"Patients with metastatic breast cancer have high and continually increasing rates of brain metastases. During the course of the disease, brain metastases can occur in up to 30% of these patients. In most cases, brain metastases are diagnosed after significant disease progression. The blood-tumor barrier increases the difficulty of treating brain metastasis by preventing accumulation of chemotherapy within metastases at therapeutically effective concentrations. Traditional therapies, such as surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, have poor efficacy, as reflected by a low median survival rate of 5-8% after post-diagnosis. Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LiFUS) is a new treatment for enhancing drug accumulation within the brain and brain malignancies. In this study, we elucidate the effect of clinical LiFUS combined with chemotherapy on tumor survival and progression in a preclinical model of triple-negative breast cancer metastasis to the brain. LiFUS significantly increased the tumor accumulation of 14C-AIB and Texas Red compared to controls (p< 0.01). LiFUS-mediated opening of the BTB is size-dependent, which is consistent with our previous studies. Mice receiving LiFUS with combinatorial Doxil and paclitaxel showed a significant increase in median survival (60 days) compared to other groups. LiFUS plus combinatorial chemotherapy of paclitaxel and Doxil also showed the slowest progression of tumor burden compared to chemotherapy alone or individual chemotherapy and LiFUS combinations. This study shows that combining LiFUS with timed combinatorial chemotherapeutic treatment is a potential strategy for improving drug delivery to brain metastases.",0
"BACKGROUND: Helplessness and hopelessness are states closely related to depressive disorders. They ensue following the anticipated absence of valid behavioral options to alleviate an aversive state. One neural structure involved in the detection of such options, is the cingulate cortex (CC), which conveys the evaluation of behavior against the value of its outcome. Accordingly, CC-related EEG measures are thought to correlate to feedback evaluation but also to anxious and conflict-related states, signaling the need for further adaptation to current requirements. Against this background, this study investigated the role (CC) functioning in the emergence and prevention of helpless/hopeless states by applying low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (litFUS) neuromodulation prior to a learned helplessness task. METHOD: In a randomized controlled double blind experimental setup with 55 participants, litFUS was used to inhibit the right lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC), a region closely connected to CC modulation. Participants were instructed to play 8 games of chess against a computer that was unbeatable to them, while an EEG was recorded. Theta oscillation in midline electrodes, playing performance and self-rate measures on cognitive, affective and physiological parameters were assessed. RESULTS: The results show a considerable influence of litFUS neuromodulation of the lPFC on midline theta activity (Fz and Pz electrode position) which in turn correlated to several psychological variables including self-report data on emotion, cognition, and arousal as well as behavioral measures (playing performance). LIMITATIONS: Due to the small sample size and sample characteristics, results cannot be generalized to the field of clinical application. A replication of results in larger samples and in context of other sonication parameters is needed to increase efficacy litFUS and robustness of results. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the development of learned helplessness/hopelessness could be positively influenced in its course by litFUS neuromodulation of the right lPFC. In line with previous results, especially the posterior midline electrode Pz seems to be an interesting target for further research in this field as theta activity at this electrode is correlated to control perception and motivated behavior. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use neuromodulation to monitor and manipulate the development of helplessness in the laboratory.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Focused ultrasound ablation (FUSA) is an emerging treatment for neurological and psychiatric diseases. We describe the initial experience from a pilot, open-label, single-center, clinical trial of unilateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) FUSA in patients with treatment-refractory epilepsy. METHODS: Two adult subjects with treatment-refractory, focal-onset epilepsy were recruited. The subjects received ANT FUSA using the Exablate Neuro (Insightec, Inc.) system. We determined the safety and feasibility (primary outcomes), and changes in seizure frequency (secondary outcome) at 3, 6 and 12-months. Safety was assessed by the absence of side effects, i.e., new-onset neurological deficits or performance deterioration on neuropsychological testing. Feasibility was defined as the ability to create a lesion within the anterior nucleus. The monthly seizure frequency was compared between baseline and post thalamotomy. RESULTS: The patients tolerated the procedure well without neurological deficits or serious adverse events. One patient experienced a decline in verbal fluency, attention/working memory, and immediate verbal memory. Seizure frequency reduced significantly in both patients: one patient was seizure free at 12-months, and in the second patient, the frequency reduced from 90-100 seizures per month to 3-6 seizures per month. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first known clinical trial to assess the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of ANT FUSA in adult patients with treatment-refractory focal-onset epilepsy.",0
"Objective: In recent years, transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (tcMRgFUS) has been established as a potential treatment option for movement disorders, including essential tremor (ET). So far, however, little is known about the impact of tcMRgFUS on structural connectivity. The objective of this study was to detect microstructural changes in tremor- and motor-related white matter tracts in ET patients treated with tcMRgFUS thalamotomy. Methods: Eleven patients diagnosed with ET were enrolled in this tcMRgFUS thalamotomy study. For each patient, 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI) including structural and diffusion MRI were acquired and the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor was assessed before the procedure as well as 1 year after the treatment. Diffusion MRI tractography was performed to identify the cerebello-thalamo-cortical tract (CTCT), the medial lemniscus, and the corticospinal tract in both hemispheres on pre-treatment data. Pre-treatment tractography results were co-registered to post-treatment diffusion data. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD), were averaged across the tracts in the pre- and post-treatment data. Results: The mean value of tract-specific DTI metrics changed significantly within the thalamic lesion and in the CTCT on the treated side (p < 0.05). Changes of DTI-derived indices within the CTCT correlated well with lesion overlap (FA: r = -0.54, p = 0.04; MD: r = 0.57, p = 0.04); RD: r = 0.67, p = 0.036). Further, a trend was seen for the correlation between changes of DTI-derived indices within the CTCT and clinical improvement (FA: r = 0.58; p = 0.062; MD: r = -0.52, p = 0.64; RD: r = -0.61 p = 0.090). Conclusions: Microstructural changes were detected within the CTCT after tcMRgFUS, and these changes correlated well with lesion-tract overlap. Our results show that diffusion MRI is able to detect the microstructural effects of tcMRgFUS, thereby further elucidating the treatment mechanism, and ultimately to improve targeting prospectively. Impact statement The results of this study demonstrate microstructural changes within the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways 1 year after MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy. Even more, microstructural changes within the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways correlated significantly with clinical outcome. These findings do not only highly emphasize the need of new targeting strategies for MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy but also help to elucidate the treatment mechanism of it.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy ameliorates symptoms in patients with essential tremor (ET). How this treatment affects canonical brain networks has not been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to clarify changes of brain networks after MRgFUS thalamotomy in ET patients by analyzing resting-state networks (RSNs). METHODS: Fifteen patients with ET were included in this study. Left MRgFUS thalamotomy was performed in all cases, and MR images, including resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), were taken before and after surgery. MR images of 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were also used for analysis. Using rsfMRI data, canonical RSNs were extracted by performing dual regression analysis, and the functional connectivity (FC) within respective networks was compared among pre-MRgFUS patients, post-MRgFUS patients, and HCs. The severity of tremor was evaluated using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) score pre- and postoperatively, and its correlation with RSNs was examined. RESULTS: Preoperatively, ET patients showed a significant decrease in FC in the sensorimotor network (SMN), primary visual network (VN), and visuospatial network (VSN) compared with HCs. The decrease in FC in the SMN correlated with the severity of tremor. After MRgFUS thalamotomy, ET patients still exhibited a significant decrease in FC in a small area of the SMN, but they exhibited an increase in the cerebellar network (CN). In comparison between pre- and post-MRgFUS patients, the FC in the SMN and the VSN significantly increased after treatment. Quantitative evaluation of the FCs in these three groups showed that the SMN and VSN increased postoperatively and demonstrated a trend toward those of HCs. CONCLUSIONS: The SMN and CN, which are considered to be associated with the cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop, exhibited increased connectivity after MRgFUS thalamotomy. In addition, the FC of the visual network, which declined in ET patients compared with HCs, tended to normalize postoperatively. This could be related to the hypothesis that visual feedback is involved in tremor severity in ET patients. Overall, the analysis of the RSNs by rsfMRI reflected the pathophysiology with the intervention of MRgFUS thalamotomy in ET patients and demonstrated a possibility of a biomarker for successful treatment.",0
"BACKGROUND: MRgFUS Vim ablation is increasingly used for the treatment of tremor in ET e PD patients but there is little published research on the importance of operator experience in this procedure. This study aims to evaluate the learning curve and the influence of the operator experience on the procedural and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 90 patients (38 ET, 52 PD) submitted to MRgFUS unilateral thalamotomy in the period between February 2018 and July 2020. Clinical endpoints, procedural times, and technical parameters were recorded in all procedures. Based on the time of treatment, patients were divided into three groups of 30 units each, comparing all variables between each time period group. RESULTS: In Group A, the average patient preparation time was 120.6 min, the treatment time was 105.2 min, the number of was sonications 14.1, and the mean target shifts 3.1. In Group B, the mean preparation time was 105.5 min, the treatment time was 89.5 min, the number of sonications was 13.2, and the target shifts 3.0. Group C showed inferior values of preparation time (101.9 min), treatment time (71.7 min), numbers of sonications (10.6), and shifts (1.7). Thalamotomy-related complications occurred in 9 patients of Group A, 2 of Group B, and 5 of Group C. Tremor relapse occurred in 7 patients of Group A, 3 of Group B, and 2 of Group C. The days of hospitalization were comparable in the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The operators experience is associated with the improvement of clinical and procedural outcome in MRgFUS thalatomy for the treatment of ET and PD tremor.",0
"BACKGROUND: neurosurgical interventions such as MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) are increasingly deployed for treatment of essential tremor. OBJECTIVE: to make recommendations for monitoring treatment effects during and after MRgFUS based on our investigation of correlations between different scales of tremor severity. METHODS: twenty-five clinical assessments were collected from thirteen patients before and after unilateral MRgFUS sequential lesioning of the thalamus and posterior subthalamic area for alleviating essential tremor. Scales included Bain Findley Spirography (BFS), Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST), Upper Extremity Total Tremor Score (UETTS) and Quality of Life of Essential Tremor (QUEST), and were documented at baseline, while lying in the scanner with stereotactic frame attached (BFS), and at 24-month follow-up. RESULTS: the four different scales of tremor severity all correlated significantly. BFS and CRST showed a strong correlation of 0.833 (p < 0.001). BFS, UETTS and CRST correlated moderately with QUEST (ρ = 0.575-0.721, p < 0.001). BFS and UETTS correlated significantly with all CRST subparts, with the strongest correlation between UETTS and CRST part C (ρ = 0.831, p < 0.001). Moreover, BFS drawn sitting upright in an outpatient setting correlated with spirals drawn in a supine position on the scanner bed with the stereotactic frame attached. CONCLUSION: we recommend a combination of BFS & UETTS for intraoperative assessment of awake essential tremor patients and BFS & QUEST for pre-operative and follow-up assessments, as these scale sets are quick and simple to collect and provide meaningful information whilst meeting the practical constraints of intraoperative assessment.",0
"BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy is used to treat essential tremor and tremor-dominant Parkinson disease. Feedback is collected throughout the procedure to verify the location of the target and completeness of response; however, variability in clinical judgments may underestimate or overestimate treatment response. OBJECTIVE: To objectively quantify joint motion after each sonication using accelerometers secured to the contralateral upper extremity in an effort to optimize MRgFUS treatment. METHODS: Before the procedure, 3 accelerometers were secured to the patient's arm, forearm, and index finger. Throughout the procedure, tremor motion was regularly recorded during postural and kinetic tremor testing and individual joint angle measures were modeled. The joint angle from each accelerometer was compared with baseline measurements to assess changes in angles. Subsequent adjustments to the target location and sonication energy were made at the discretion of the neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist. RESULTS: Intraoperative accelerometer measurements of hand tremor from 18 patients provided quantified data regarding joint angle reduction: 87.3%, 94.2%, and 86.7% for signature writing, spiral drawing, and line drawing tests, respectively. Target adjustment based on accelerometer monitoring of the angle at each joint added substantial value toward achieving optimal tremor reduction. CONCLUSION: Real-time accelerometer recordings collected during MRgFUS thalamotomy offered objective quantification of changes in joint angle after each sonication, and these findings were consistent with clinical judgments of tremor response. These results suggest that this technique could be used for fine adjustment of the location of sonication energy and number of sonications to consistently achieve optimal tremor reduction.",0
"PURPOSE: To evaluate the 2-year outcomes of ultrasound cyclo plasty (UCP) as a first procedure in glaucoma. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with uncontrolled glaucoma who underwent UCP as an initial glaucoma procedure. The main outcome measures were intraocular pressure (IOP), the number of antiglaucoma medications, visual acuity, and the presence of vision-threatening complications. Surgical outcomes of each eye were classified as either complete success, qualified success, or failure based on the main outcome measures. Differences in IOP control and success rates were compared in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). RESULTS: We included 98 eyes of 88 patients in the study. The mean follow-up period was 27.25 ± 10.1 months. At 12 and 24 months, mean IOP decreased significantly from 23.16 ± 6.4 mmHg to 16.57 ± 6.0 mmHg and 16.18 ± 5.2 mmHg, respectively, and the number of antiglaucoma medications decreased from 3.27 ± 0.9 to 1.86 ± 1.4 and 1.70 ± 1.7, respectively (p < .01 for all). There were no changes in visual acuity throughout the follow-up compared with preoperative levels. The cumulative probabilities of success were 64.3% (±4.8) [78.9% (±9.4) complete success, and 72.9% (±6.4) qualified success], and 42.9% (±5.0) [52.6% (±11.5) complete success, and 56.3% (±7.2) qualified success] at 12 and 24 months, respectively. The most common complications were cataract development/progression, anterior chamber inflammation, and macular edema. There were no significant differences in IOP, number of antiglaucoma medications, or survival rates between POAG and PACG groups. CONCLUSIONS: UCP can be used as an initial glaucoma procedure for reducing IOP and the number of antiglaucoma medications and offers comparable outcomes in POAG and PACG.",0
"PRCIS: Ultrasound cycloplasty (UCP) using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an effective and safe procedure in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma, even in those with high myopia. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UCP in glaucoma patients with high-myopia. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we enrolled 36 eyes divided into two groups based on axial length: group A (≥26.00 mm) and group B (<26.00 mm). We collected data about visual acuity, Goldmann applanation tonometry, biomicroscopy, and visual field before the procedure and at 1, 7, 30, 60, 90, 180, and 365 days after the procedure. RESULTS: Mean IOP significantly decreased in both groups after treatment (P<0.001). Mean IOP reduction from baseline to the last visit was 9.8±6.6 mmHg (38.7%) in group A and 9.6±6.3 mmHg (34.8%) in group B (P<0.001). Mean IOP at the last visit was 15.8±4.1 mmHg in the myopic group and 18.1±5.6 mmHg in the non-myopic one. Regarding the number of IOP-lowering eyedrops being taken by our patients, no statistically significant differences were found between groups A and B at baseline (2.8±0.9 and 2.6±1.0; P=0.568) nor 1 year after the procedure (2.5±1.1 and 2.6±1.1; P=0.762). No major complications occurred. All minor adverse events resolved within a few days. CONCLUSION: UCP seems to be an effective and well-tolerated strategy to lower IOP in glaucoma patients with high-myopia.",0
"Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is an application of focused ultrasound (FUS) that enables a sonosensitizing agent to prime tumors for increased sensitivity during sonication. Unfortunately, current clinical treatments for glioblastoma (GBM) are lacking, leading to low long-term survival rates among patients. SDT is a promising method for treating GBM in an effective, noninvasive, and tumor-specific manner. Sonosensitizers preferentially enter tumor cells compared to the surrounding brain parenchyma. The application of FUS in the presence of a sonosensitizing agent generates reactive oxidative species resulting in apoptosis. Although this therapy has been shown previously to be effective in preclinical studies, there is a lack of established standardized parameters. Standardized methods are necessary to optimize this therapeutic strategy for preclinical and clinical use. In this paper, we detail the protocol to perform SDT in a preclinical GBM rodent model using magnetic resonance-guided FUS (MRgFUS). MRgFUS is an important feature of this protocol, as it allows for specific targeting of a brain tumor without the need for invasive surgeries (e.g., craniotomy). The benchtop device used here can focus on a specific location in three dimensions by clicking on a target on an MRI image, making target selection a straightforward process. This protocol will provide researchers with a standardized preclinical method for MRgFUS SDT, with the added flexibility to change and optimize parameters for translational research.",0
"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Due to the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in China, the incidence of HCC in China is high, and liver cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis also brings great challenges to treatment. This paper reviewed the latest research progress on minimally invasive treatments for HCC, including percutaneous thermal ablation and new nonthermal ablation techniques, and introduced the principles, advantages, and clinical applications of various therapeutic methods in detail. DATA SOURCES: The data of treatments for HCC were systematically collected from the PubMed, ScienceDirect, American Chemical Society and Web of Science databases published in English, using ""minimally invasive"" and ""hepatocellular carcinoma"" or ""liver cancer"" as the keywords. RESULTS: Percutaneous thermal ablation is still a first-line strategy for the minimally invasive treatment of HCC. The effect of microwave ablation (MWA) on downgrading treatment before liver transplantation is better than that of radiofrequency ablation (RFA), while RFA is more widely used in the clinical practice. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is mainly used for the palliative treatment of advanced liver cancer. Electrochemotherapy (ECT) delivers chemotherapeutic drugs to the target cells while reducing the blood supply around HCC. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) uses a microsecond-pulsed electric field that induces apoptosis and necrosis and triggers a systemic immune response. The nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF) has achieved a good response in the ablation of mice with HCC, but it has not been reported in China for the treatment of human HCC. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of minimally invasive treatments provide a sufficient survival advantage for HCC patients. Nonthermal ablation will lead to a new wave with its unique advantage of antitumor recurrence and metastasis.",0
"PURPOSE: Image-guided thermal ablation are established treatment options for non-surgical patients with primary and metastatic liver cancers. However, there are limitations with nonuniformity of cancer tissue destruction, heat sink effect and the risk of thermal ablative injury. The current non-thermal ablative techniques have high risk of local recurrence and are not widely adopted. Histotripsy is a treatment technology that destroys targeted tissue under ultrasound visualization via mechanical destruction through the precise application of acoustic cavitation and can offer the potential of non-invasive, non-thermal and non-ionizing radiation cancer treatment. The aim of this multi-centre non-randomized phase I/II trial is to assess the initial safety and efficacy of the prototype investigational 'System' in the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. METHODS/DESIGN: All non-surgical patients with primary/metastatic liver cancers having had previous liver directed therapy, radiation therapy or image-guided ablation may be offered image-guided Histotripsy as per trial protocol. The co-primary endpoints are technical success and procedural safety. Technical success is determined, at ≤ 36 h post procedure, by evaluating the histotripsy treatment size and coverage. The procedural safety is defined by procedure related major complications, defined as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5) grade 3 or higher toxicities, up to 30 days post procedure. This phase I/II trial has intended to recruit up to 45 patients to show safety and efficacy of image-guided histotripsy in liver cancers.

"PURPOSE: To determine the risk of mechanical vessel wall damage resulting in hemorrhage during and after hepatic and renal histotripsy in an anticoagulated in vivo porcine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-tumor-bearing pigs (n = 8; mean weight, 52.5 kg) were anticoagulated with warfarin (initial dose, 0.08 mg/kg) to a target prothrombin time (PT) of 30%-50% above baseline. A total of 15 histotripsy procedures were performed (kidney: n = 8, 2.0-cm sphere; liver: n = 7, 2.5-cm sphere). Treatments were immediately followed by computed tomography (CT) imaging. Animals were observed for 7 days while continuing anticoagulation, followed by repeat CT and necropsy. RESULTS: All animals survived to complete the entire protocol with no signs of disability or distress. Three animals had hematuria (pink urine without clots). Baseline PT values (mean, 16.0 seconds) were elevated to 22.0 seconds (37.5% above baseline, P = .003) on the day of treatment and to 28.8 seconds (77.8% above baseline, P < .001) on the day of necropsy. At the time of treatment, 5 of 8 (63%) animals were at a therapeutic anticoagulation level, and all 8 animals (100%) reached therapeutic levels by the time of necropsy. There were no cases of intraparenchymal, peritoneal, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage associated with any treatments despite 5 of 7 (71%) liver and all 8 (100%) kidney treatments extending to the organ surface. CONCLUSIONS: Liver and kidney histotripsy seems safe with no elevated bleeding risk in this anticoagulated animal model, supporting the possibility of histotripsy treatments in patients on anticoagulation.",0
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common digestive malignancies. HCC It ranges as the fifth most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide. While The prognosis of metastatic or advanced HCC is still quite poor. Recently, locoregional treatment, especially local ablation therapies, plays an important role in the treatment of HCC. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation are the most common-used methods effective and feasible for treating HCC. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of ablation in the treatments for HCC and the HCC recurrence after ablation still are poorly understood. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), the key gene switch for adaptive responses to hypoxia, has been found to play an essential role in the rapid aggressive recurrence of HCC after ablation treatment. In this review, we summarized the current evidence of the roles of HIF in the treatment of HCC with ablation. Fifteen relevant studies were included and further analyzed. Among them, three clinical studies suggested that HIF-1α might serve as a crucial role in the RAF treatment of HCC or the local recurrence of HCC after RFA. The remainder included experimental studies demonstrated that HIF-1, 2α might target the different molecules (e.g., BNIP3, CA-IX, and arginase-1) and signaling cascades (e.g., VEGFA/EphA2 pathway), constituting a complex network that promoted HCC invasion and metastasis after ablation. Currently, the inhibitors of HIF have been developed, providing important proof of targeting HIF for the prevention of HCC recurrence after IRFA and HIFU ablation. Further confirmation by prospective clinical and in-depth experimental studies is still warranted to illustrate the effects of HIF in HCC recurrence followed ablation treatment in the future.",0
"Introduction: Allogenic hepatocyte transplantation is an attractive alternative to whole-organ transplantation, particularly for the treatment of metabolic disorders and acute liver failure. However, the shortage of human donor organs for cell isolation, the low cell yield from decellularisation regimes, and low engraftment rates from portal administration of donor cells have restricted its clinical application. Using ultrasound histotripsy to provide a nidus in the liver for direct cell transplantation offers a new approach to overcoming key limitations in current cell therapy. We have analysed the liver cavity constituents to assess their potential as a site for cell delivery and implantation. Methods: Using human organ retrieval techniques, pig livers were collected from the abattoir and transported in ice-cold storage to the laboratory. Following 2 h of cold storage, the livers were flushed with organ preservation solution and placed on an organ perfusion circuit to maintain viability. Organs were perfused with Soltran™ organ preservation solution via the portal vein at a temperature of 24-30 °C. The perfusion circuit was oxygenated through equilibration with room air. Perfused livers (n=5) were subjected to ultrasound histotripsy, producing a total of 130 lesions. Lesions were generated by applying 50 pulses at 1 Hz pulse repetition frequency and 1% duty cycle using a single element 2 MHz bowl-shaped transducer (Sonic Concepts, H-148). Following histotripsy, a focal liver lesion was produced, which had a liquid centre. The fluid from each lesion was aspirated and cultured in medium (RPMI) at 37 °C in an incubator. Cell cultures were analysed at 1 and 7 days for cell viability and a live-dead assay was performed. The histotripsy sites were excised following aspiration and H&E staining was used to characterise the liver lesions. Cell morphology was determined by histology. Results: Histotripsy created a subcapsular lesion (~5 mm below the liver capsule; size ranging from 3 to 5 mm), which contained a suspension of cells. On average, 61×104 cells per mL were isolated. Hepatocytes were present in the aspirate, were viable at 24 h post isolation and remained viable in culture for up to 1 week, as determined by phalloidin/DAPI cell viability stains. Cultures up to 21 days revealed metabolically active live hepatocyte. Live-dead assays confirmed hepatocyte viability at 1 week (Day 1: 12% to Day 7: 45% live cells; p < 0.0001), which retained metabolic activity and morphology, confirmed on assay and microscopy. Cell Titre-GloTM showed a peak metabolic activity at 1 week (average luminescence 24.6 RLU; p < 0.0001) post-culture compared with the control (culture medium alone), reduced to 1/3 of peak level (7.85 RLU) by day 21. Conclusions: Histotripsy of the liver allows isolation and culture of hepatocytes with a high rate of viability after 1 week in culture. Reproducing these findings using human livers may lead to wide clinical applications in cell therapy.",0
"Surgical extirpation of liver tumors remains a proven approach in the management of metastatic tumors to the liver, particularly those of colorectal origin. Ablative, non-resective therapies are an increasingly attractive primary therapy for liver tumors as they are generally better tolerated and result in far less morbidity and mortality. Ablative therapies preserve greater normal liver parenchyma allowing better post-treatment liver function and are particularly appropriate for treating subsequent liver-specific tumor recurrence. This article reviews the current status of ablative therapies for non-hepatocellular liver tumors with a discussion of many of the clinically available approaches.",0
"BACKGROUND: Moderate-to-severe acute pain is prevalent in many healthcare settings and associated with adverse outcomes. Peripheral nerve blockade using traditional needle-based and local anesthetic-based techniques improves pain outcomes for some patient populations but has shortcomings limiting use. These limitations include its invasiveness, potential for local anesthetic systemic toxicity, risk of infection with an indwelling catheter, and relatively short duration of blockade compared with the period of pain after major injuries. Focused ultrasound is capable of inhibiting the peripheral nervous system and has potential as a pain management tool. However, investigations of its effect on peripheral nerve nociceptive fibers in animal models of acute pain are lacking. In an in vivo acute pain model, we investigated focused ultrasound's effects on behavior and peripheral nerve structure. METHODS: Focused ultrasound was applied directly to the sciatic nerve of rats just prior to a hindpaw incision; three control groups (focused ultrasound sham only, hindpaw incision only, focused ultrasound sham+hindpaw incision) were also included. For all four groups (intervention and controls), behavioral testing (thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, hindpaw extension and flexion) took place for 4 weeks. Structural changes to peripheral nerves of non-focused ultrasound controls and after focused ultrasound application were assessed on days 0 and 14 using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Compared with controls, after focused ultrasound application, animals had (1) increased mechanical nociceptive thresholds for 2 weeks; (2) sustained increase in thermal nociceptive thresholds for ≥4 weeks; (3) a decrease in hindpaw motor response for 0.5 weeks; and (4) a decrease in hindpaw plantar sensation for 2 weeks. At 14 days after focused ultrasound application, alterations to myelin sheaths and nerve fiber ultrastructure were observed both by light and electron microscopy. DISCUSSION: Focused ultrasound, using a distinct parameter set, reversibly inhibits A-delta peripheral nerve nociceptive, motor, and non-nociceptive sensory fiber-mediated behaviors, has a prolonged effect on C nociceptive fiber-mediated behavior, and alters nerve structure. Focused ultrasound may have potential as a peripheral nerve blockade technique for acute pain management. However, further investigation is required to determine C fiber inhibition duration and the significance of nerve structural changes.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Medial thalamotomies were introduced in the late 1940s. Pain relief was shown to be achieved for all body locations. With some exceptions, these early relatively small series showed frequent, more or less complete recurrence of the original pain. The posterior part of the central lateral nucleus in the human medial thalamus was identified in the 1990s using multiarchitectonic studies and intraoperative single-cell recordings and was confirmed as a surgical target. This retrospective patient series extended over 11 years. Its goal was to demonstrate the efficacy and risk profile of the MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) central lateral thalamotomy (CLT) against chronic and therapy-resistant neuropathic (i.e., neurogenic) pain. METHODS: In this single-center, nonrandomized retrospective cross-sectional analysis of consecutive patients, 63 consecutive MRgFUS CLT interventions were performed in 55 patients. RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 55 months. A total of 112 CLT targets were performed, and the CLT was applied bilaterally in 48 patients and contralateral to their pain in 7 patients. Repeat MRgFUS interventions were performed in 8 patients. One serious adverse event with numbness of the upper lip was recorded. The mean pain relief rated by patients was 42% ± 32% at 3 months, 43% ± 36% at 1 year, and 42% ± 37% at the last follow-up (n = 63). The proportions of cases with ≥ 30% pain relief were 65% at 3 months, 63% at 1 year, and 61% at the last follow-up. Good outcomes (≥ 50% pain relief) were found in 54% of patients at 3 months, 49% at 1 year, and 51% at the last follow-up. The reduction in mean VAS scores showed similar percentage reductions as those for pain relief (-41% for continuous pain and -49% for pain attacks) at the 1-year follow-up. The mean frequency of pain attacks was reduced by 92%. Allodynia was reduced or suppressed in 68% of patients and never appeared de novo after MRgFUS CLT. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MRgFUS CLT against neuropathic pain is a safe approach and its results are stable over time. At a mean follow-up duration of 55 months, the mean pain relief was 42% and more than 50% of patients still reported ≥ 50% pain relief. Patients with classical and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia reported a higher mean pain relief compared with the whole patient group.",0
"BACKGROUND: Obesity-induced insulin resistance leads to the metabolic syndrome. Both bariatric surgery and surgical fat removal have been shown to improve metabolic health, but the metabolic benefits of nonsurgical fat removal remain uncertain. The aim of this paper is to establish whether nonsurgical fat removal exerts measurable, lasting metabolic benefits by way of changes to serum lipid profiles. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, and clinical trials registers were searched using the Polyglot Search Translator to find studies examining quantitative changes in metabolic markers after nonsurgical body contouring procedures. The MethodologicAl STandard for Epidemiological Research (MASTER) scale was adopted for the quality assessment of the included studies. The robust-error meta-regression (REMR) model was employed. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies and 676 participants were included. Peak body compositions measures manifest as a reduction of 2 units in body mass index (BMI), 1 kg of body weight (BW), 5 cm in waist circumference (WC) and 1.5 cm in abdominal fat thickness (FT), sustained up to 60 days postprocedure. Transient increases of 15 mg/dL in low-density lipoprotein (LDL), 10 mg/dl in triglycerides (TG), and 15 mg/dl in total cholesterol (TC) were observed at 2 weeks postprocedure. CONCLUSION: While nonsurgical fat removal exerts sustained effects on body anthropometrics, changes to serum lipid profiles were transient. There is no compelling evidence at present to support the conclusion that nonsurgical fat removal is metabolically beneficial.",0
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) leads to decreased subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) thickness via heat-induced adipocyte necrosis. Heat can induce adipocyte apoptosis and autophagy, and it is known that nuclear or mitochondrial p53 is involved in apoptosis and autophagy. However, whether HIFU leads to apoptosis or autophagy is unclear. We evaluated whether HIFU decreases SAT thickness via p53-related apoptosis or autophagy in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed animals. The expression of nuclear and mitochondrial p53 was increased by HIFU. HIFU also led to decreased expression of BCL2/BCL-xL (an antiapoptotic signal), increased expression of BAX/BAK (an apoptotic signal), increased levels of cleaved caspase 3/9, and increased numbers of apoptotic cells as evaluated by TUNEL assay. Furthermore, HIFU led to increased levels of ATG5, BECN1, and LC3II/LC3I, and decreased levels of p62, a marker of increased autophagy. The thickness of SAT was decreased by HIFU. In conclusion, HIFU led to nuclear and mitochondrial p53 expression, which led to apoptosis and autophagy, and eventually decreased SAT thickness in HFD-fed animals.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Currently available cytotoxic treatments have limited effect on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) because desmoplastic stroma limits drug delivery. Efforts have been made to overcome these barriers by drug targeting the tumor microenvironment. Results so far are promising, but without clinical impact. Our aim was to investigate whether ultrasound and microbubbles could improve the uptake and therapeutic response of conventional chemotherapy. METHODS: Orthotopic pancreatic tumors growing in mice were treated with commercially available FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and calcium folinate) and SonoVue microbubbles combined with focused ultrasound. Tumor uptake of platinum (Pt) was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and tumor volumes were measured by ultrasound imaging. DISCUSSION: Uptake of Pt, the active ingredient of oxaliplatin, was significantly increased after ultrasound treatment of orthotopic PDAC tumors. Multiple injections with FOLFIRONOX increased the amount of Pt in tumors. However, the enhanced accumulation did not improve therapeutic response. Increased uptake of Pt confirms that ultrasound and microbubbles have potential in clinical practice with existing drugs. CONCLUSION: The lack of therapeutic response, despite increased uptake in tumor tissue, emphasizes the importance of studying how to overcome stromal barriers.",0
"BACKGROUND: Unilateral focused ultrasound ablation of the internal segment of globus pallidus has reduced motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease in open-label studies. METHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 3:1 ratio, patients with Parkinson's disease and dyskinesias or motor fluctuations and motor impairment in the off-medication state to undergo either focused ultrasound ablation opposite the most symptomatic side of the body or a sham procedure. The primary outcome was a response at 3 months, defined as a decrease of at least 3 points from baseline either in the score on the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III (MDS-UPDRS III), for the treated side in the off-medication state or in the score on the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) in the on-medication state. Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline to month 3 in the scores on various parts of the MDS-UPDRS. After the 3-month blinded phase, an open-label phase lasted until 12 months. RESULTS: Of 94 patients, 69 were assigned to undergo ultrasound ablation (active treatment) and 25 to undergo the sham procedure (control); 65 patients and 22 patients, respectively, completed the primary-outcome assessment. In the active-treatment group, 45 patients (69%) had a response, as compared with 7 (32%) in the control group (difference, 37 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 15 to 60; P = 0.003). Of the patients in the active-treatment group who had a response, 19 met the MDS-UPDRS III criterion only, 8 met the UDysRS criterion only, and 18 met both criteria. Results for secondary outcomes were generally in the same direction as those for the primary outcome. Of the 39 patients in the active-treatment group who had had a response at 3 months and who were assessed at 12 months, 30 continued to have a response. Pallidotomy-related adverse events in the active-treatment group included dysarthria, gait disturbance, loss of taste, visual disturbance, and facial weakness. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral pallidal ultrasound ablation resulted in a higher percentage of patients who had improved motor function or reduced dyskinesia than a sham procedure over a period of 3 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer and larger trials are required to determine the effect and safety of this technique in persons with Parkinson's disease. (Funded by Insightec; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03319485.).",0
"The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) tremor remains incompletely understood and there is a lack of clinical trials specifically addressing its pharmacological treatment. Levodopa is the most efficacious drug for most patients and should be used as primary approach to control troublesome tremor. While the efficacy of oral dopamine agonists on PD tremor has been demonstrated in controlled trials, there is no evidence of greater antitremor efficacy compared to levodopa. The magnitude of the antitremor effect of anticholinergics is generally lower than that of levodopa. Due to their adverse effects, anticholinergics have a limited role in selected young and cognitively intact patients. Propranolol may improve resting and action tremor and may be considered as an adjunct in patients with insufficient tremor response to levodopa and this also applies to clozapine, despite its unfavorable adverse effect profile. Treating motor fluctuations with MAO-B and COMT inhibitors, dopamine agonists, amantadine, or on-demand treatments such as subcutaneous or sublingual apomorphine and inhaled levodopa as well as with continuous infusions of levodopa or apomorphine will improve off period tremor episodes. For patients with drug-refractory PD tremor despite levodopa optimization deep brain stimulation and focused ultrasound are first-line considerations. Surgery can also be highly effective for the treatment medication-refractory tremor in selected patients without motor fluctuations. The present review highlights the clinical essentials of parkinsonian tremor, critically examines available trial data on the effects of medication and surgical approaches and provides guidance for the choice of treatments to control PD tremor in clinical practice.",0
"OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative safety and effectiveness of two prostate cancer treatment ablation modalities-irreversible electroporation (IRE) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).  METHODS: Two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) on IRE and HIFU were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted in PubMed and EMBASE. Independent reviewers assessed literature eligibility and abstracted safety and effectiveness data. Oncological, safety, functional, and quality of life (QOL) outcomes were examined for each technology. MAs were conducted where data quality and availability allowed, using normal methods and a random/mixed effects model, and quality assessments performed. RESULTS: Fifty-five publications (n=22 IRE; n=33 HIFU) were included in the SLRs, and MAs were conducted on negative in-field post-procedure biopsy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level reduction, potency, urinary continence, and AE rate outcomes. MAs revealed that IRE patients had lower mean percent PSA level reductions, higher mean rates of in-field negative post-treatment biopsy, and higher rates of potency maintenance than HIFU patients. Most adverse events (AEs) reported were comparable and minor (Grades I, II), with urinary tract infection, dysuria, hematuria, and incontinence or urgency most frequently reported. The proportion of patients experiencing a severe AE (≥Grade III) ranged from 0 to 8% after IRE and HIFU. Both modalities were associated with positive functional outcomes as well as maintenance of QOL after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both IRE and HIFU were found to produce favorable effectiveness outcomes and have low complication rates while minimally impacting patient urinary and erectile function and maintaining overall QOL. These real-world findings can help guide clinical decision making and improve disease management for patients with prostate cancer.",0
"Focused ultrasound (FUS) can be used to physiologically change or destroy tissue in a non-invasive way. A few commercial systems have clinical approval for the thermal ablation of solid tumors for the treatment of neurological diseases and palliative pain management of bone metastases. However, the thermal effects of FUS are known to lead to various biological effects, such as inhibition of repair of DNA damage, reduction in tumor hypoxia, and induction of apoptosis. Here, we studied radiosensitization as a combination therapy of FUS and RT in a xenograft mouse model using newly developed MRI-compatible FUS equipment. Xenograft tumor-bearing mice were produced by subcutaneous injection of the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Animals were treated with FUS in 7 T MRI at 4.8 W/cm2 to reach ~45 °C and held for 30 min. The temperature was controlled via fiber optics and proton resonance frequency shift (PRF) MR thermometry in parallel. In the combination group, animals were treated with FUS followed by X-ray at a single dose of 10 Gy. The effects of FUS and RT were assessed via hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Tumor proliferation was detected by the immunohistochemistry of Ki67 and apoptosis was measured by a TUNEL assay. At 40 days follow-up, the impact of RT on cancer cells was significantly improved by FUS as demonstrated by a reduction in cell nucleoli from 189 to 237 compared to RT alone. Inhibition of tumor growth by 4.6 times was observed in vivo in the FUS + RT group (85.3%) in contrast to the tumor volume of 393% in the untreated control. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of combined MRI-guided FUS and RT for the treatment of prostate cancer in a xenograft mouse model and may provide a chance for less invasive cancer therapy through radiosensitization.",0
"OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy with coblation for the treatment of inferior turbinate hypertrophy (ITH). METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 20 patients underwent inferior turbinate surgery, which consisted of either HIFU or coblation therapy. Efficacy, safety and tolerability were evaluated by subjective symptom scores, acoustic rhinometry, and nasal endoscopy. RESULTS: The modified nasal obstruction symptom evaluation (NOSE) score and nasal obstruction visual analog scale (NO-VAS) were significantly decreased in both groups 12 weeks postoperatively. Differences between the evaluation scores of the two patient groups were not significant. On nasal endoscopy, the HIFU patients showed improvements in mucosal swelling sooner than the patients undergoing coblation therapy. Nasal crusting was significantly increased in the patients undergoing coblation over the patients undergoing HIFU therapy, until postoperative week 4. Mucosal preservation was superior in the HIFU patients. Although HIFU was less painful than coblation therapy during the procedure, the difference was not significant (4.9 vs 6.3, p=0.143). The difference between global satisfaction in the two groups was not significant, although satisfaction was slightly greater for the HIFU than the coblation patients (4.6 vs 4.1, p=0.393). CONCLUSION: HIFU provided results similar to those of coblation therapy for patients with nasal obstruction due to ITH, but HIFU therapy caused less discomfort during the procedure. HIFU therapy appears to be a good noninvasive alternative to the current surgical modalities for ITH.",0
"AIM: To compare the therapeutic efficacy of ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU) in the treatment of adenomyosis with different signal intensity (SI) on T2-weighted images (T2WI). METHODS: A total of 299 adenomyosis patients who underwent HIFU and completed a one-year follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. Based on the SI values of adenomyosis relative to myometrium and endometrium on T2WI MRI, the patients were classified into three groups: the hypointense adenomyosis (Hypo-AM) group, the isointense adenomyosis (Iso-AM) group, and the hyperintense adenomyosis (Hyper-AM) group. The non-perfused volume ratio (NPVr) and relief of dysmenorrhea were used to assess the therapeutic efficacy. Optimal cutpoints (CPs) of NPVr were determined using the postoperative dysmenorrhea score as an anchor. Logistic regression analysis was used to test the relationship between the NPVr and SI. RESULTS: The clinical effectiveness rate was significantly lower in the Hyper-AM group than in the Hypo-AM and Iso-AM groups (P < 0.05 for both). The NPVr in the Hypo-AM and Iso-AM groups were significantly higher than that in the Hyper-AM group (P < 0.05 for both). The optimal CP was 54.0% for NPVr. Logistic regression analysis showed that the SI on T2WI was an effect factor for NPVr (P < 0.05), and the probability of NPVr ≥54.0% decreased continuously as the SI of adenomyosis increased. CONCLUSIONS: The NPVr of 54.0% has a clinically significant impact on dysmenorrhea scores in patients. The efficiency of the Hypo-AM and Iso-AM was better than that of the Hyper-AM.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Thalamotomy at the nucleus ventralis intermedius using MR-guided focused ultrasound has been an effective treatment method for essential tremor (ET). However, this is not true for all cases, even for successful ablation. How the brain differs in patients with ET between those with long-term good and poor outcomes is not clear. To analyze the functional connectivity difference between patients in whom thalamotomy was effective and those in whom thalamotomy was ineffective and its prognostic role in ET treatment, the authors evaluated preoperative resting-state functional MRI in thalamotomy-treated patients. METHODS: Preoperative resting-state functional MRI data in 85 patients with ET, who were experiencing tremor relief at the time of treatment and were followed up for a minimum of 6 months after the procedure, were collected for the study. The authors conducted a graph independent component analysis of the functional connectivity matrices of tremor-related networks. The patients were divided into thalamotomy-effective and thalamotomy-ineffective groups (thalamotomy-effective group, ≥ 50% motor symptom reduction; thalamotomy-ineffective group, < 50% motor symptom reduction at 6 months after treatment) and the authors compared network components between groups. RESULTS: Seventy-two (84.7%) of the 85 patients showed ≥ 50% tremor reduction from baseline at 6 months after thalamotomy. The network analysis shows significant suppression of functional network components with connections between the areas of the cerebellum and the basal ganglia and thalamus, but enhancement of those between the premotor cortex and supplementary motor area in the noneffective group compared to the effective group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that patients in the noneffective group have suppressed functional subnetworks in the cerebellum and subcortex regions and have enhanced functional subnetworks among motor-sensory cortical networks compared to the thalamotomy-effective group. Therefore, the authors suggest that the functional connectivity pattern might be a possible predictive factor for outcomes of MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy.",0
"Transcranial ultrasound is more and more used for therapy and imaging of the brain. However, the skull is a highly attenuating and aberrating medium, with different structures and acoustic properties among samples and even within a sample. Thus, case-specific simulations are needed to perform transcranial focused ultrasound interventions safely. In this article, we provide a review of the different methods used to model the skull and to simulate ultrasound propagation through it.",0
"Optogenetics employs engineered viruses to genetically modify cells to express specific light-sensitive ion channels. The standard method for gene delivery in the brain involves invasive craniotomies that expose the brain and direct injections of viruses that invariably damage neural tissue along the syringe tract. A recently proposed alternative in which non-invasive optogenetics is performed with focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) openings has been found to non-invasively facilitate gene delivery for optogenetics in mice. Although gene delivery can be performed non-invasively, validating successful viral transduction and expression of encoded ion channels in target tissue typically involves similar invasive techniques, such as craniotomies in longitudinal studies and/or postmortem histology. Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) is an emerging neuroimaging technique that can be used to transcranially detect changes in cerebral blood volume following introduction of a stimulus. In this study, we implemented a fully non-invasive combined FUS-fUSi technique for performing optogenetics in mice. FUS successfully delivered viruses encoding the red-shifted channelrhodopsin variant ChrimsonR in all treated subjects. fUSi successfully identified stimulus-evoked cerebral blood volume changes preferentially in brain regions expressing the light-sensitive ion channels. Improvements in cell-specific targeting of viral vectors and transcranial ultrasound imaging will make the combined technique a useful tool for neuroscience research in small animals.",0
"Elastic, anisotropic tissue such as tendon has proven resistant to mechanical fractionation by histotripsy, a subset of focused ultrasound that uses the creation, oscillation and collapse of cavitation bubbles to fractionate tissue. Our objective was to fabricate an optically transparent hydrogel that mimics tendon for evaluation of histotripsy bubble dynamics. Ex vivo bovine deep digital flexor tendons were obtained (n = 4), and varying formulations of polyacrylamide (PA), collagen and fibrin hydrogels (n = 3 each) were fabricated. Axial sound speeds were measured at 1 MHz for calculation of anisotropy. All samples were treated with a 1.5-MHz focused ultrasound transducer with 10-ms pulses repeated at 1 Hz (p+ = 127 MPa, p- = 35 MPa); treatments were monitored with passive cavitation imaging and high-speed photography. Dehydrated fibrin gels were found to be the most similar to tendon in cavitation emission energy (fibrin = 0.69 ± 0.24, tendon = 0.64 ± 0.19 [× 1010 V2]) and anisotropy (fibrin = 3.16 ± 1.12, tendon = 19.4). Bubble cloud area in dehydrated fibrin (0.79 ± 0.14 mm2) was significantly smaller than most other tested hydrogels. Finally, anisotropy was found to have moderately strong linear relationships with cavitation energy and bubble cloud size (r = -0.65 and -0.80, respectively). Dehydrated fibrin shows potential as a repeatable, transparent, tissue-mimicking hydrogel for evaluation of histotripsy bubble dynamics in elastic, anisotropic tissues.",0
"BACKGROUND: Liposuction, the most common body sculpting surgical procedure known today is associated with the risk of numerous complications. A safer and more noninvasive approach involves the use of high-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU) lasers, which work by selectively damaging fat tissue through apoptosis or necrosis induction of fat cells. The authors' systematic review was designed to identify the effectiveness of HIFU for nonsurgical facial and body contouring. METHODS: An exhaustive literature search was conducted of the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Scopus, and EBSCO electronic databases for the period from November of 2005 to July of 2020. The full text of selected articles was reviewed for possible study inclusion, and articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria were recruited. Characteristics of the included studies were noted, and outcomes were assessed. Assessment of quality and risk of bias was performed for all the studies using the RevMan tool and the methodological index for nonrandomized studies. RESULTS: The initial search revealed a total of 4584 citations, of which only 11 were included in the present review: nine used HIFU for recontouring of the abdomen and only two used HIFU over the face and neck. Studies evaluated either the efficacy of HIFU or the safety of its use. The average total energy ranged from 140 to 248 J/cm 2 for the abdominal region and 0.3 to 1.2 J/cm 2 for the face and neck. The focal depth ranged from 1.1 to 1.8 cm. All the studies showed promising results with the use of HIFU. CONCLUSION: HIFU therapy is safe, effective, and minimally invasive, with predictable results when used for body and facial recontouring.",0
"Background.Noninvasive and cell-type-specific neuromodulation tools are critically needed for probing intact brain function. Sonogenetics for noninvasive activation of neurons engineered to express thermosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) by transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) was recently developed to address this need. However, using TRPV1-mediated sonogenetics to evoke behavior by targeting the cortex is challenged by its proximity to the skull due to high skull absorption of ultrasound and increased risks of thermal-induced tissue damage.Objective.This study evaluated the feasibility and safety of TRPV1-mediated sonogenetics in targeting the motor cortex to modulate the locomotor behavior of freely moving mice.Approach.Adeno-associated viral vectors was delivered to the mouse motor cortex via intracranial injection to express TRPV1 in excitatory neurons. A wearable FUS device was installed on the mouse head after a month to control neuronal activity by activating virally expressed TRPV1 through FUS sonication at different acoustic pressures. Immunohistochemistry staining ofex vivobrain slices was performed to verify neuron activation and evaluate safety.Results.TRPV1-mediated sonogenetic stimulation at 0.7 MPa successfully evoked rotational behavior in the direction contralateral to the stimulation site, activated cortical neurons as indicated by the upregulation of c-Fos, and did not induce significant changes in inflammatory or apoptotic markers (GFAP, Iba1, and Caspase-3). Sonogenetic stimulation of TRPV1 mice at a higher acoustic pressure, 1.1 MPa, induced significant changes in motor behavior and upregulation of c-Fos compared with FUS sonication of naïve mice at 1.1 MPa. However, signs of damage at the meninges were observed at 1.1 MPa.Significance.TRPV1-mediated sonogenetics can achieve effective and safe neuromodulation at the cortex with carefully selected FUS parameters. These findings expand the application of this technique to include superficial brain targets.",0
"Background: Focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening is a noninvasive, safe and reversible technique for targeted drug delivery to the brain. Most preclinical systems developed to perform and monitor BBB opening are comprised of a separate geometrically focused transducer and passive cavitation detector (PCD) or imaging array. This study builds upon previous work from our group developing a single imaging phased array configuration for simultaneous BBB opening and monitoring called theranostic ultrasound (ThUS), leveraging ultra-short pulse lengths (USPLs) and a novel rapid alternating steering angles (RASTA) pulse sequence design for simultaneous bilateral sonications with target-specific USPL. The RASTA sequence was further employed to evaluate the impact of USPL on BBB opening volume, power cavitation imaging (PCI) pixel intensity, BBB closing timeline, drug delivery efficiency, and safety. Methods: A P4-1 phased array transducer driven by a Verasonics Vantage ultrasound system was operated using a custom script to run the RASTA sequence which consisted of interleaved steered, focused transmits and passive imaging. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed initial opening volume and closure of the BBB by longitudinal imaging through 72 hours post-BBB opening. For drug delivery experiments, mice were systemically administered a 70 kDa fluorescent dextran or adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) for fluorescence microscopy or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to evaluate ThUS-mediated molecular therapeutic delivery. Additional brain sections were also H&E-stained to evaluate histological damage, and IBA1- and GFAP-stained to elucidate the effects of ThUS-mediated BBB opening on stimulation of key cell types involved in the neuro-immune response, microglia and astrocytes. Results: The ThUS RASTA sequence induced distinct BBB openings simultaneously in the same mouse where volume, PCI pixel intensity, level of dextran delivery, and AAV reporter transgene expression were correlated with brain hemisphere-specific USPL, consistent with statistically significant differences between 1.5, 5, and 10-cycle USPL groups. BBB closure after ThUS required 2-48 hours depending on USPL. The potential for acute damage and neuro-immune activation increased with USPL, but such observable damage was nearly reversed 96 hours post-ThUS. Conclusion: ThUS is a versatile single-array technique which exhibits the potential for investigating a variety of non-invasive therapeutic delivery applications in the brain.",0
"Several therapeutic agents for neurological disorders are usually not delivered to the brain owing to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a special structure present in the central nervous system (CNS). Focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles can reversibly and temporarily open the BBB, enabling the application of various therapeutic agents in patients with neurological disorders. In the past 20 years, many preclinical studies on drug delivery through FUS-mediated BBB opening have been conducted, and the use of this method in clinical applications has recently gained popularity. As the clinical application of FUS-mediated BBB opening expands, it is crucial to understand the molecular and cellular effects of FUS-induced microenvironmental changes in the brain so that the efficacy of treatment can be ensured, and new treatment strategies established. This review describes the latest research trends in FUS-mediated BBB opening, including the biological effects and applications in representative neurological disorders, and suggests future directions.",0
"BACKGROUND: Transcranial ultrasound imaging and therapy depend on the efficient transmission of acoustic energy through the skull. Multiple previous studies have concluded that a large incidence angle should be avoided during transcranial focused ultrasound therapy to ensure transmission through the skull. Alternatively, some other studies have shown that longitudinal-to-shear wave mode conversion might improve transmission through the skull when the incidence angle is increased above the critical angle (i.e., 25° to 30°). PURPOSE: The effect of skull porosity on the transmission of ultrasound through the skull at varying incidence angles was investigated for the first time to elucidate why transmission through the skull at large angles of incidence is decreased in some cases but improved in other cases. METHODS: Transcranial ultrasound transmission at varying incidence angles (0° to 50°) was investigated in phantoms and ex vivo skull samples with varying bone porosity (0% to 28.54 ± 3.36%) using both numerical and experimental methods. First, the elastic acoustic wave transmission through the skull was simulated using micro-computed tomography data of ex vivo skull samples. The trans-skull pressure was compared between skull segments having three levels of porosity, i.e. low porosity (2.65 ± 0.03%), medium porosity (13.41 ± 0.12%) and high porosity (26.9%). Next, transmission through two 3D-printed resin skull phantoms (compact versus porous phantoms) was experimentally measured to test the effect of porous microstructure alone on ultrasound transmission through flat plates. Finally, the effect of skull porosity on ultrasound transmission was investigated experimentally by comparing transmission through two ex vivo human skull segments having similar thicknesses but different porosities (13.78 ± 2.05% versus 28.54 ± 3.36%). RESULTS: Numerical simulations indicated that an increase in transmission pressure occurs at large incidence angles for skull segments having low porosities but not for those with high porosity. In experimental studies, a similar phenomenon was observed. Specifically, for the low porosity skull sample (13.78 ± 2.05%), the normalized pressure was 0.25 when the incidence angle increased to 35°. However, for the high porosity sample (28.54 ± 3.36%), the pressure was no more than 0.1 at large incidence angles. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the skull porosity has an evident effect on the transmission of ultrasound at large incidence angles. The wave mode conversion at large, oblique incidence angles could enhance the transmission of ultrasound through parts of the skull having lower porosity in the trabecular layer. However, for transcranial ultrasound therapy in the presence of highly porous trabecular bone, transmission at a normal incidence angle is preferable relative to oblique incidence angles due to the higher transmission efficiency.

"To improve the ultrasonic energy and realize far-field ultrasonic abrasive machining of complex surfaces, a spherical-array-focused ultrasonic abrasive machining system was established. By combining ultrasonic field simulation, detection and a single-factor experiment, the influences of the ultrasonic generator current, abrasive concentration, and particle size on the material removal properties and surface quality evolution of quartz glass were investigated. When the current was less than 0.4 A, the material removal showed plastic removal at the nanoscale. When the current was more than 0.5 A, the cavitation phenomenon formed micron-scale impact removal traces on the workpiece surface. The increase in abrasive concentration increased the impact density and material removal rate, while excessive abrasive concentration increased the impeding effect between abrasive particles and reduced the material removal rate. Moreover, the increase in abrasive particle concentration enhanced heterogeneous cavitation nucleation, promoted the removal of abrasive impact materials under the action of a cavitation jet, and inhibited the removal of direct surface cavitation. The abrasive particle size affects the heterogeneous cavitation nucleation and the acceleration of the cavitation jet on abrasive particles, which affects the material removal rate and surface quality. By controlling the energy of the focused ultrasound and abrasive parameters, the plastic or brittle domain removal of quartz glass can be achieved at the micro- and nanoscales.",0
"Sonodynamic therapy involving the non-invasive and local generation of lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) via ultrasound (US) with sonosensitizers has been proposed as an emerging tumor therapy strategy. However, such therapy is usually associated with inertial cavitation and unnecessary damage to healthy tissue because current sonosensitizers have insufficient sensitivity to US. Here, we report the use of a new proposed sonosensitizer, carbon dots (C-dots), to assemble microbubbles with a gas core (C-dots MBs). As the C-dots were directly integrated into the MB shell, they could effectively absorb the energy of inertial cavitation and transfer it to ROS. Our results revealed the appearance of 1O2, •OH, and H2O2 after US irradiation of C-dots MBs. In in vitro experiments, treatment with C-dots MBs plus US induced lipid peroxidation, elevation of intracellular ROS, and apoptosis in 32.5%, 45.3%, and 50.1% of cells respectively. In an animal solid tumor model, treatment with C-dots MBs plus US resulted in a 3-fold and 2.5-fold increase in the proportion of ROS-damaged cells and apoptotic cells, respectively, compared to C-dots MBs alone. These results will pave the way for the design of novel multifunctional sonosensitizers for SDT tumor therapy.",0
"Tissue mimicking phantoms (TMPs) play an essential role in modern biomedical research as cost-effective quality assurance and training tools, simultaneously contributing to the reduction of animal use. Herein, we present the development and evaluation of an anatomically accurate mouse phantom intended for image-guided thermal ablation and Focused Ultrasound (FUS) applications. The proposed mouse model consists of skeletal and soft tissue mimics, whose design was based on the Computed tomography (CT) scans data of a live mouse. Advantageously, it is compatible with US, CT, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The compatibility assessment was focused on the radiological behavior of the phantom due to the lack of relevant literature. The X-ray linear attenuation coefficient of candidate materials was estimated to assess the one that matches best the radiological behavior of living tissues. The bone part was manufactured by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printing using Acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA) material. For the soft-tissue mimic, a special mold was 3D printed having a cavity with the unique shape of the mouse body and filled with an agar-based silica-doped gel. The mouse phantom accurately matched the size and reproduced the body surface of the imaged mouse. Tissue-equivalency in terms of X-ray attenuation was demonstrated for the agar-based soft-tissue mimic. The phantom demonstrated excellent MRI visibility of the skeletal and soft-tissue mimics. Good radiological contrast between the skeletal and soft-tissue models was also observed in the CT scans. The model was also able to reproduce realistic behavior during trans-skull sonication as proved by thermocouple measurements. Overall, the proposed phantom is inexpensive, ergonomic, and realistic. It could constitute a powerful tool for image-guided thermal ablation and FUS studies in terms of testing and optimizing the performance of relevant equipment and protocols. It also possess great potential for use in transcranial FUS applications, including the emerging topic of FUS-mediated blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption.",0
"BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to compare safety and functional outcomes of total, hemi and focal ablation by the latest focal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device. METHODS: This is a prospective study including patients with low to intermediate-risk PCa treated with HIFU by Focal One® device from 11/2018 to 3/2020. Before the treatment all patients underwent mp-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequent MRI/transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion and standard biopsy. Patients were stratified according to the type of ablation: total, hemi- or focal ablation. Functional data (IPSS, Quality of Life [QoL], IIEF-5, maximum flow [Qmax] and post void residual [PVR] at flowmetry) were assessed preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Moreover, the urinary symptoms reported by patients at IPSS questionnaire were divided in ""irritative"" and ""obstructive"" and compared. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled. Median prostate volume and lesion diameter were 46 (IQR 25-75) mL and 10 (IQR 6-13) mm. 15, 50 and 35 patients underwent total, hemi- and focal ablation, respectively. No differences were found between them except for operative time (lower in the focal group, P<0.01). Significant lower incidence of irritative symptoms was identified in the focal group compared to the others (P<0.05 at 1 and 3 months of follow-up). No differences were found among the baseline status and the postoperative assessment in terms of obstructive IPSS items, IIEF-5, QoL, Qmax and PVR (all P value>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that patients' specific HIFU tailoring with the MRI/real-time TRUS Guidance by Focal One® device is able to minimize the side effects of treatment.",0
"BACKGROUND: Although amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and unfortunately incurable yet, incremental attention has been drawn to targeting the health of corticospinal motor neurons. Focused ultrasound combined with systemically circulating microbubbles (FUS/MB) is an emerging modality capable of site-specific molecular delivery temporarily and noninvasively within a range of appropriate parameters. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of FUS/MB-enhanced delivery of therapeutics to the motor cortex on the disease progression by using a transgenic mouse model of ALS. METHODS: Multiple FUS/MB-enhanced deliveries of Edaravone (Eda) to the motor cortex were performed on the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS. The motor function of the animals was evaluated by gait analysis, grip strength and wire hanging tests. Corticospinal and spinal motor neuronal health, misfolded SOD1 protein and neuroinflammation after treatments were evaluated by histological examination. RESULTS: Ultrasound-enhanced delivery of Eda in the targeted motor cortex was achieved by a two-fold increase without gross tissue damage. Compared with the ALS mice administered Eda treatments only, the animals given additionally FUS/MB-enhanced brain delivery of Eda (FUS/MB + Eda) exhibited further improvements in neuromuscular functions characterized by gait patterns, muscular strength, and motor coordination along with rescued muscle atrophy. FUS/MB + Eda treatments conferred remarkable neuroprotection to both upper and lower motor neurons revealed by normalized neuronal morphology with increasing cell body size and profoundly alleviated neuroinflammation and misfolded SOD1 protein in the brains and lumbar spinal cords. CONCLUSION: We report a pilot study that non-invasive ultrasound-enhanced brain delivery of Eda provides additive amelioration on disease progression of ALS and suggest that broadening the target from spinal to cortical network functions using the FUS/MB-enhanced delivery can be a rational therapeutic strategy of this debilitating disorder.",0
"PURPOSE: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an intractable disease for which various treatments have been attempted, but with little effect. This study aimed to measure the effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and sonodynamic therapy (SDT), which are currently being used to treat brain tumors, as well as sono-photodynamic therapy (SPDT), which is the combination of these two. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with C6 glioma cells in a cortical region and treated with PDT, SDT, and SPDT. Gd-MRI was monitored weekly and 18F-FDG-PET the day before and 1 week after the treatment. The acoustic power used during sonication was 5.5 W/cm² using a 0.5-MHz single-element transducer. The 633-nm laser was illuminated at 100 J/cm². Oxidative stress and apoptosis markers were evaluated 3 days after treatment using immunohistochemistry (IHC): 4-HNE, 8-OhdG, and Caspase-3. RESULTS: A decrease in tumor volume was observed in MRI imaging 12 days after the treatment in the PDT group (p<0.05), but the SDT group showed a slight increase compared to the 5-Ala group. The high expression rates of reactive oxygen species-related factors, such as 8-OhdG (p<0.001) and Caspase-3 (p<0.001), were observed in the SPDT group compared to other groups in IHC. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that light with sensitizers can inhibit GBM growth, but not ultrasound. Although SPDT did not show the combined effect in MRI, high oxidative stress was observed in IHC. Further studies are needed to investigate the safety parameters to apply ultrasound in GBM.",0
"In recent years, veterinary medicine has expanded its practices beyond conventional methods, gradually integrating the Focused Ultrasound (FUS) technology in the care of companion animals like dogs and cats. The current study aimed to examine the feasibility and provide insights into the application of thermal FUS in canine and feline mammary cancer therapy. FUS was delivered by a 2-MHz single-element spherically focused ultrasonic transducer as integrated with an existing robotic positioning device. The functionality of the FUS system and sonication protocol in efficiently and safely ablating live tissue was initially validated in a rabbit thigh model in a laboratory environment. Nine (9) dogs and cats with superficial mammary cancer were recruited through a dedicated campaign according to specific safety criteria. The veterinary patients underwent FUS ablation followed by immediate surgical resection of the entire malignancy. Histopathology examination demonstrated well-defined regions of coagulative necrosis in all treated tumors with no off-target damage. Further study with a larger patient population is needed to confirm the current findings and demonstrate the safety and feasibility of complete FUS ablation of deep-seated tumors.",0
"This article reviews the results of various non-surgical curative treatments for operable breast cancer. Radiotherapy is considered the most important among such treatments, but conventional radiotherapy alone and concurrent chemoradiotherapy do not achieve high cure rates. As a radiosensitization strategy, intratumoral injection of hydrogen peroxide before radiation has been investigated, and high local control rates (75-97%) were reported. The authors treated 45 patients with whole-breast radiotherapy, followed by stereotactic or intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost, with or without a radiosensitization strategy employing either hydrogen peroxide injection or hyperthermia plus oral tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium. Stages were 0-I in 23 patients, II in 19, and III in 3. Clinical and cosmetic outcomes were good, with 5-year overall, progression-free, and local recurrence-free survival rates of 97, 86, and 88%, respectively. Trials of carbon ion radiotherapy are ongoing, with promising interim results. Radiofrequency ablation, focused ultrasound, and other image-guided ablation treatments yielded complete ablation rates of 20-100% (mostly ≥70%), but long-term cure rates remain unclear. In these treatments, combination with radiotherapy seems necessary to treat the extensive intraductal components. Non-surgical treatment of breast cancer is evolving steadily, with radiotherapy playing a major role. In the future, proton therapy with the ultra-high-dose-rate FLASH mode is expected to further improve outcomes.",0
"Introduction: The side effects of conventional therapy for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are severe, with inflammatory reactions playing a pivotal role. It is particularly important to explore new ways of treatment thrombosis by targeting inflammatory factors. Methods: A targeted microbubble contrast agent was prepared using the biotin-avidin method. The 40 DVT model rabbits were established and divided into four groups according to different treatment regimens. The four coagulation indexes, TNF-α, and D-dimer content of experimental animals were measured before modeling and before and after treatment, and the thrombolysis was assessed by ultrasound imaging. Finally, the results were verified by pathology. Results and Discussion: Fluorescence microscopy verified the successful preparation of targeted microbubbles. Among the groups, PT, APTT, and TT in Group II-IV were longer than those in Group I (all p < 0.05). FIB and D-dimer content were lower than those in Group I (all p < 0.05), and TNF-α content in Group IV was lower than that in Group I-III (all p < 0.05). Pairwise comparison before modeling and before treatment and after treatment showed that, after treatment, the PT, APTT, and TT in Group II-IV were longer than those before modeling (all p < 0.05). The contents of FIB and D-dimer were lower than those before modeling and before treatment (all p < 0.05). The content of TNF-α decreased significantly only in Group IV, but increased in the other three groups. Targeted microbubbles combined with Low-power focused ultrasound can reduce inflammation, significantly promote thrombolysis, and provide new ideas and methods for the diagnosis and treatment of acute DVT.",0
"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) are common and potentially incapacitating conditions. Even when recognized and adequately treated, in over a third of patients with these conditions the response to first-line pharmacological and psychotherapeutic measures is not satisfactory. After more assertive measures including pharmacological augmentation (and in the case of depression, transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy, or treatment with ketamine or esketamine), a significant number of individuals remain severely symptomatic. In these persons, different ablation and deep-brain stimulation (DBS) psychosurgical techniques have been employed. However, apart from the cost and potential morbidity associated with surgery, on average only about half of patients show adequate response, which limits the widespread application of these potentially life-saving interventions. Possible reasons are considered for the wide variation in outcomes across different series of patients with MDD or OCD exposed to ablative or DBS psychosurgery, including interindividual anatomical and etiological variability. Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is an emerging technique that holds promise in its ability to achieve anatomically circumscribed, noninvasive, and reversible neuromodulation of deep brain structures. A possible role for LIFU in the personalized presurgical definition of neuromodulation targets in the individual patient is discussed, including a proposed roadmap for clinical trials addressed at testing whether this technique can help to improve psychosurgical outcomes.",0
"OBJECTIVE: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) followed by curettage or uterine artery embolization (UAE) followed by curettage are relatively effective methods for cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP), which can provide a high success rate and repregnancy while reducing blood loss and adverse events. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pregnancy outcomes of HIFU groups versus UAE groups with CSP. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases were systematically searched to find studies that compared the therapeutic effects of HIFU groups versus UAE groups. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Our primary end points were blood loss, adverse events, success rate, and repregnancy. We implemented random-effects models or fixed-effects models to evaluate the pooled data. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Thirty-four eligible items were included in studies. The blood loss was significantly reduced in HIFU groups compared with UAE groups (standardized mean difference = -1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.21 to -0.68; p <.001). Significantly fewer adverse events occurred in the HIFU groups than in UAE groups (odds ratio [OR] = 0.36, 95% CI, 0.23-0.57; p <.001). The success rate of HIFU groups was higher than that of UAE groups (OR = 1.56, 95% CI, 1.05-2.32; p = .03). There were more pregnancies in HIFU groups than in UAE groups (OR = 1.64, 95% CI, 1.28-2.11; p <.001). CONCLUSION: In the CSP, the effect of HIFU groups was better than that of UAE groups: less blood loss, high success rate, fewer adverse events, and favorable fertility protection. Thus, it is a promising therapeutic method for patients.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) compared with uterine artery embolization (UAE) in caesarean section pregnancy (CSP), and to calculate the success rate of HIFU. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase on September 30, 2022, and the related studies were independently reviewed by two researchers. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Medical subject headings and relevant terms from other articles were used for the database search. Patients with CSP who underwent HIFU were included in this analysis. The following results were recorded: success rate, intraoperative blood loss, time for serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hcg) normalisation and menstruation recovery, adverse events, hospitalisation time, and hospitalisation expenses. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scoring system and the methodological index for non-randomised studies system to evaluate the quality of the studies. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Data from six studies were used to compare the efficacy and safety of UAE and HIFU. We pooled the success rate of HIFU by including 10 studies. No data overlap between the 10 studies. Success rate was higher in the HIFU group (odds ratio [OR]=1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-3.41; P=.03; I2=0). We performed the meta-analysis of single rate in R 4.2.0 software, and the success rate of HIFU group was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96; P=.04; I2=48%). Intraoperative blood loss (mean difference [MD]= -21.94 mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] -67.34-23.47; P=.34; I2=99%) and time for serum β-hcg normalisation (MD=3.13 days; 95% CI 0.02-6.25; P=.05; I2=70%) were not significantly different. Time to menstruation recovery (MD=2.72 days; 95% CI 1.32-4.12; P=.000; I2=0) in the UAE group was shorter than that in the HIFU group. Adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups (OR=0.53; 95% CI 0.22-1.29; P=.16; I2=81%). Hospitalisation time was not significantly different between the HIFU and UAE groups (MD=-0.41 days; 95% CI -1.14-0.31; P=.26; I2=55%). Hospitalisation expenses of the HIFU group were lower than those of the UAE group (MD=-7488.49 yuan; 95% CI -8460.13 to -6516.84; P<.000; I2=0). Heterogeneity of the time for β-hcg normalisation, adverse events, and hospitalisation time were improved after excluding one study, and HIFU showed better results in the sensitivity analysis of adverse events and hospitalisation time. CONCLUSION: According to our analysis, HIFU demonstrated satisfactory treatment success, accompanied by similar intraoperative blood loss, slower normalisation of β-hcg levels, and menstruation recovery, but potentially shorter hospitalisation time, lower adverse events, and lower costs than UAE. Therefore, HIFU is an effective, safe, and economical treatment for patients with CSP. These conclusions should be interpreted with caution because of the significant heterogeneity. However, large and strictly designed clinical trials are required to verify these conclusions.",0
"OBJECTIVE: It is unknown whether ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption can promote epileptogenesis and how BBB integrity changes over time after sonication. METHODS: To gain more insight into the safety profile of ultrasound (US)-induced BBB opening, we determined BBB permeability as well as histological modifications in C57BL/6 adult control mice and in the kainate (KA) model for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in mice after sonication with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPU). Microglial and astroglial changes in ipsilateral hippocampus were examined at different time points following BBB disruption by respectively analyzing Iba1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity. Using intracerebral EEG recordings, we further studied the possible electrophysiological repercussions of a repeated disrupted BBB for seizure generation in nine non-epileptic mice. RESULTS: LIPU-induced BBB opening led to transient albumin extravasation and reversible mild astrogliosis, but not to microglial activation in the hippocampus of non-epileptic mice. In KA mice, the transient albumin extravasation into the hippocampus mediated by LIPU-induced BBB opening did not aggravate inflammatory processes and histologic changes that characterize the hippocampal sclerosis. Three LIPU-induced BBB opening did not induce epileptogenicity in non-epileptic mice implanted with depth EEG electrodes. CONCLUSION: Our experiments in mice provide persuasive evidence of the safety of LIPU-induced BBB opening as a therapeutic modality for neurological diseases.",0
"The efficacy of many anti-epileptic drugs, including phenytoin (PHT), is reduced by plasma protein binding (PPB) that sequesters therapeutically active drug molecules within the bloodstream. An increase in systemic dose elevates the risk of drug side effects, which demands an alternative technique to increase the unbound concentration of PHT in a region-specific manner. We present a low-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) technique that locally enhances the efficacy of PHT by transiently disrupting its binding to albumin. We first identified the acoustic parameters that yielded the highest PHT unbinding from albumin among evaluated parameter sets using equilibrium dialysis. Then, rats with chronic mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) received four sessions of PHT injection, each followed by 30 min of FUS delivered to the ictal region, across 2 weeks. Two additional groups of mTLE rats underwent the same procedure, but without receiving PHT or FUS. Assessment of electrographic seizure activities revealed that FUS accompanying administration of PHT effectively reduced the number and mean duration of ictal events compared to other conditions, without damaging brain tissue or the blood-brain barrier. Our results demonstrated that the FUS technique enhanced the anti-epileptic efficacy of PHT in a chronic mTLE rodent model by region-specific PPB disruption.",0
"Focused ultrasound (FUS) has the potential to modulate regional brain excitability and possibly aid seizure control; however, effects on behavior of FUS used as a seizure therapy are unknown. This study explores behavioral effects and hippocampal restoration induced by pulsed FUS in a kainic acid (KA) animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Twenty-nine male Sprague-Dawley rats were observed for 20 weeks with anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and behavioral performance evaluations, comprising measures of anxiety, limb usage, sociability, and memory. FUS targeted to the right hippocampus was given 9 and 14 weeks after KA was delivered to the right amygdala. Ultrasound pulsations were delivered with the acoustic settings of 0.25 of mechanical index, 0.5 W/cm2 of intensity spatial peak temporal average (ISPTA), 100 Hz of pulse repetition frequency, and 30% of duty cycle, during three consecutive pulse trains of 10 min separated by 5-min rests. Controls included normal animals with sham injections and KA-exposed animals without FUS exposure. Longitudinal MRI observations showed that FUS substantially protected hippocampal and striatal structures from KA-induced atrophy. KA alone increased anxiety, impaired contralateral limb usage, and reduced sociability and learning. Two courses of FUS sonications partially ameliorated these impairments by enhancing exploring and learning, balancing limb usage, and increasing social interaction. The histology results indicated that two sonications enhanced neuroprotection effect and decreased the inflammation markers induced by KA. This study supports existence of both neuroprotective and beneficial behavioral effects from low-intensity pulsed ultrasound in the KA animal model of epilepsy.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate, at 4 and 5 years posttreatment, the long-term safety and efficacy of unilateral MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy for medication-refractory essential tremor in a cohort of patients from a prospective, controlled, multicenter clinical trial. METHODS: Outcomes per the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST), including postural tremor scores (CRST Part A), combined hand tremor/motor scores (CRST Parts A and B), and functional disability scores (CRST Part C), were measured by a qualified neurologist. The Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST) was used to assess quality of life. CRST and QUEST scores at 48 and 60 months post-MRgFUS were compared to those at baseline to assess treatment efficacy and durability. All adverse events (AEs) were reported. RESULTS: Forty-five and 40 patients completed the 4- and 5-year follow-ups, respectively. CRST scores for postural tremor (Part A) for the treated hand remained significantly improved by 73.3% and 73.1% from baseline at both 48 and 60 months posttreatment, respectively (both p < 0.0001). Combined hand tremor/motor scores (Parts A and B) also improved by 49.5% and 40.4% (p < 0.0001) at each respective time point. Functional disability scores (Part C) increased slightly over time but remained significantly improved through the 5 years (p < 0.0001). Similarly, QUEST scores remained significantly improved from baseline at year 4 (p < 0.0001) and year 5 (p < 0.0003). All previously reported AEs remained mild or moderate, and no new AEs were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy demonstrates sustained and significant tremor improvement at 5 years with an overall improvement in quality-of-life measures and without any progressive or delayed complications. Clinical trial registration no.: NCT01827904 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",0
"BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance-guided focused-ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy is an effective treatment for essential and other tremors. It targets the ventrointermedius (Vim) nucleus, which is the thalamic relay in a proprioceptive pathway, and contains kinesthetic cells. Although MRgFUS thalamotomy reduces some risks associated with more invasive surgeries, it still has side effects, such as balance and gait disturbances; these may be caused by the lesion impacting proprioception. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to quantitatively measure the effects of MRgFUS on proprioception and limb use in essential tremor patients. We hypothesized that this thalamotomy alters proprioception, because the sensorimotor Vim thalamus is lesioned. METHODS: Proprioception was measured using the Kinarm exoskeleton robot in 18 patients. Data were collected pre-operatively, and then 1 day, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. Patients completed four tasks, assessing motor coordination and postural control, goal-directed movement and bimanual planning, position sense, and kinesthesia. RESULTS: Immediately after surgery there were changes in posture speed (indicating tremor improvement), and in bimanual hand use, with the untreated limb being preferred. However, these measures returned to pre-operative baseline over time. There were no changes in parameters related to proprioception. None of these measures correlated with lesion size or lesion-overlap with the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first quantitative assessment of proprioception and limb preference following MRgFUS thalamotomy. Our results suggest that focused-ultrasound lesioning of the Vim thalamus does not degrade proprioception but alters limb preference. This change may indicate a required ""relearning"" in the treated limb, because the effect is transient. © 2023 The Authors.

"BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has become popular as an incisionless mode of neurosurgical treatment. However, head pain during sonication is common and its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To explore the characteristics of head pain occurring during MRgFUS thalamotomy. METHODS: Our study comprised 59 patients who answered questions about the pain they experienced during unilateral MRgFUS thalamotomy. The location and features of pain were investigated using a questionnaire including the numerical rating scale (NRS) to estimate maximum pain intensity and the Japanese version of the Short Form of McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of pain. Several clinical factors were investigated for possible correlation with pain intensity. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (81%) reported sonication-related head pain, and the degree of pain was severe (NRS score ≥ 7) in 39 patients (66%). The distribution of sonication-related pain was ""localized"" in 29 (49%) and ""diffuse"" in 16 (27%); the most frequent location was the ""occipital"" region. The pain features most frequently reported were those in the ""affective"" subscale of the Short Form of McGill Pain Questionnaire 2. Patients with diffuse pain had a higher NRS score and lower skull density ratio than did patients with localized pain. The NRS score negatively correlated with tremor improvement at 6 months post-treatment. CONCLUSION: Most patients in our cohort experienced pain during MRgFUS. The distribution and intensity of pain varied according to the skull density ratio, indicating that the pain might have had different origins. Our results may contribute to the improvement of pain management during MRgFUS.",0
"Effective chemotherapy delivery for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is limited by drug transport across the blood-brain barrier and poor efficacy of single agents. Polymer-drug conjugates can be used to deliver drug combinations with a ratiometric dosing. However, the behaviors and effectiveness of this system have never been well investigated in GBM models. Here, we report flexible conjugates of hyaluronic acid (HA) with camptothecin (CPT) and doxorubicin (DOX) delivered into the brain using focused ultrasound (FUS). In vitro toxicity assays reveal that DOX-CPT exhibited synergistic action against GBM in a ratio-dependent manner when delivered as HA conjugates. FUS is employed to improve penetration of DOX-HA-CPT conjugates into the brain in vivo in a murine GBM model. Small-angle x-ray scattering characterizations of the conjugates show that the DOX:CPT ratio affects the polymer chain flexibility. Conjugates with the highest flexibility yield the highest efficacy in treating mouse GBM in vivo. Our results demonstrate the association of FUS-enhanced delivery of combination chemotherapy and the drug-ratio-dependent flexibility of the HA conjugates. Drug ratio in the polymer nanocomplex may thus be employed as a key factor to modulate FUS drug delivery efficiency via controlling the polymer flexibility. Our characterizations also highlight the significance of understanding the flexibility of drug carriers in ultrasound-mediated drug delivery systems.",0
"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the sustainable antihypertensive effects and protection against target organ damage caused by low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) stimulation and the underlying mechanism in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) model. METHODS AND RESULTS: SHRs were treated with ultrasound stimulation of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (VlPAG) for 20 min every day for 2 months. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was compared among normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats, SHR control group, SHR Sham group, and SHR LIFU stimulation group. Cardiac ultrasound imaging and hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining of the heart and kidney were performed to assess target organ damage. The c-fos immunofluorescence analysis and plasma levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, hydrocortisone, and endothelin-1 were measured to investigate the neurohumoral and organ systems involved. We found that SBP was reduced from 172 ± 4.2 mmHg to 141 ± 2.1 mmHg after 1 month of LIFU stimulation, P < 0.01. The next month of treatment can maintain the rat's blood pressure at 146 ± 4.2 mmHg at the end of the experiment. LIFU stimulation reverses left ventricular hypertrophy and improves heart and kidney function. Furthermore, LIFU stimulation enhanced the neural activity from the VLPAG to the caudal ventrolateral medulla and reduced the plasma levels of ANGII and Aldo. CONCLUSION: We concluded that LIFU stimulation has a sustainable antihypertensive effect and protects against target organ damage by activating antihypertensive neural pathways from VLPAG to the caudal ventrolateral medulla and further inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity, thereby supporting a novel and noninvasive alternative therapy to treat hypertension.",0
"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the combined treatment of focused ultrasound (FUS) and chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, nPac/Gem) for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Patients pathologically diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer were included. Low (Isppa = 1.5 kW/cm2), intermediate (2.0 kW/cm2), and high (2.5 kW/cm2) FUS intensity treatment groups were predefined. A 1% duty cycle and the 3+3 scheme were used. Six combined treatments were performed, and adverse events were assessed. Changes in tumor size and tumor response, CA 19-9 level, and patient-reported outcomes at the immediate follow-up (F/U) and/or at the 3-month F/U and survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Three participants were enrolled in each intensity group. No adverse device effect or dose-limiting toxicity occurred in any of the participants. Seven of the nine participants experienced a >15% tumor size decrease at the immediate F/U CT and at the 3-month F/U CT. The CA 19-9 level decreased in all of the participants at the immediate F/U. All participants in the intermediate-intensity treatment group showed a > 30% tumor size decrease, partial response, and a significant decrease in the CA 19-9 level at 3-month F/U and longer survival (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: FUS with an intensity of 1.5 to 2.5 kW/cm2 was safe in the combined treatment of FUS and nPac/Gem. Considering the results of the change in tumor size, the change in CA 19-9 level, tumor response, and survival, these FUS parameters can be used for subsequent clinical trials. KEY POINTS: • No adverse device effect or dose-limiting toxicity occurred in any of the participants when focused ultrasound with an intensity of 1.5-2.5 kW/cm2 and a low duty cycle of 1% was combined with chemotherapy. • The intermediate-intensity group showed a >30% tumor size decrease, partial response, and a significant decrease in CA 19-9 in all of the participants at the 3-month follow-up and the longest survival. • Any focused ultrasound setting used in this study could be safe and optimal for subsequent clinical trials.",0
"BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been applied successfully in treating refractory tremors in Parkinson disease (PD). It generates a precise thermal ablation in a specific nucleus or tract, such as ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) or pallidothalamic tract (PTT). Despite a single lesion improving parts of the PD symptoms, the feasibility and efficacy of a stepwise dual-lesion in VIM and PTT are yet to be explored. METHODS: Three patients with tremor-dominant PD (aged 60.7 ± 6.0 years) received dual-target MRgFUS treatment with a series of primary and secondary outcome measures. The VIM and PTT were navigated based on individual magnetic resonance imaging planning of the brain. The primary outcome measures were the off-status Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III). The secondary outcome measures included UPDRS I, II, IV, Hohen and Yahr score, Neuropsychiatry Inventory, Quality of life in PD Rating Scale, Non-Motor Symptoms Scale, and Clinical Global Impression. The baseline data were compared with those acquired 1 day and 1 month following the treatment. RESULTS: The severity of tremor and motor deficits represented by Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor-part B and UPDRS III were significantly improved (P < 0.05 by nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests) after dual-target ablations. The nonmotor symptoms investigated by UPDRS II and Non-Motor Symptoms Scale also showed significant improvement at the 1-day and 1-month follow-up. There was no adverse effect except temporary procedure-related headache and dizziness during the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Stepwise dual-lesion targeting VIM and PTT is a safe and effective MRgFUS therapeutic strategy for patients with PD.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Unilateral magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound subthalamotomy (FUS-STN) has been shown to improve the cardinal motor features of Parkinson disease (PD). Whether this effect is sustained is not known. This study aims to report the long-term outcome of patients with PD treated with unilateral FUS-STN. METHODS: We conducted a prospective open-label study of patients with asymmetrical PD who underwent unilateral FUS-STN. All patients were evaluated up to 36 months after treatment. The primary outcome was the difference from baseline to 36 months after FUS-STN in the score of the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor part (III) for the treated hemibody in the off-medication state. The safety outcome included all adverse events occurring during follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the change in the MDS-UPDRS III score on-medication; subscores of rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and axial features; total MDS-UPDRS III; and the MDS-UPDRS part IV. Functional disability and quality of life were assessed using the MDS-UPDRS II and the PDQ39, respectively. Patient impression of change and satisfaction with the treatment were self-assessed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test with subsequent Bonferroni's correction was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with PD were evaluated at 36 months after treatment. The mean (±SD) age at baseline was 56.0 ± 10.1 years, with a mean disease duration of 6.8 ± 2.8 years. The MDS-UPDRS III score for the treated hemibody off-medication was improved by 52.3% from baseline to 3 years (score reduction from 19.0 ± 3.2 to 8.9 ± 3.3, 95% CI 8.7 to 11.6, p < 0.001), and all specific motor features were improved from baseline. No disabling or delayed adverse events were reported. The total MDS-UPDRS III off-medication score was 22.9% lower at 3 years than before treatment (36.8 ± 7.4 vs 27.4 ± 6.2, 95% CI 6.0 to 11.5, p < 0.001). The MDS-UPDRS II, IV, and PDQ39 scores and levodopa dose were equivalent to those at baseline. DISCUSSION: The benefit of unilateral FUS-STN on PD motor features is sustained in the long term. FUS-STN contributes to better clinical control over several years of evolution. NCT02912871/03454425. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence on the utility of focused ultrasound unilateral subthalamotomy in the treatment of people with Parkinson disease.",0
"Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a novel and minimally invasive technology. Since the US Food and Drug Administration approved unilateral ventral intermediate nucleus-MRgFUS for medication-refractory essential tremor in 2016, studies on new indications, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), psychiatric diseases, and brain tumors, have been on the rise, and MRgFUS has become a promising method to treat such neurological diseases. Currently, as the second most common degenerative disease, PD is a research hotspot in the field of MRgFUS. The actions of MRgFUS on the brain range from thermoablation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, to neuromodulation. Intensity is a key determinant of ultrasound actions. Generally, high intensity can be used to precisely thermoablate brain targets, whereas low intensity can be used as molecular therapies to modulate neuronal activity and open the BBB in conjunction with injected microbubbles. Here, we aimed to summarize advances in the application of MRgFUS for the treatment of PD, with a focus on thermal ablation, BBB opening, and neuromodulation, in the hope of informing clinicians of current applications.",0
"We report a patient with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease who had a mild cavitation bioeffect during magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy. During the aligning phase with low-energy sonication, cavitation caused mild dysarthria and paresthesia, prompting treatment cessation. At the same time, tremor and rigidity improved. MRI revealed extensive high-intensity lesions in the thalamus 1 day after the procedure followed by steroid infusion, which resulted in resolution of adverse events. Tremor and rigidity improved 1.5 years after the procedure. Although cavitation can relieve tremors and rigidity, it should be carefully monitored due to potential permanent adverse events by unpredictable and unknown behaviors.",0
"BACKGROUND: Whilst MRI guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy is an effective treatment option for tremor disorders, there are reports of tremor recurrence in patients with tremor dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). The mechanisms for tremor recurrence are unknown but likely relate to the duality of tremor network pathways with ramifications for subsequent treatment options. CASES: We report two cases of tremor dominant PD who experienced tremor recurrence following MRgFUS thalamotomy with subsequent successful subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (DBS). Tremor scores were measured at baseline, 1- and 3-months post MRgFUS and at least 18 months post DBS in both patients. Both cases evidenced immediate improvement in tremor, after MRgFUS, followed by subsequent tremor recurrence. STN DBS resulted in almost complete long-term tremor alleviation in both cases. CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of STN DBS in patients with tremor dominant PD with tremor recurrence following MRgFUS thalamotomy. We discuss the dualism of tremor outflow pathways that may have implications for single target lesional therapies.",0
"BACKGROUND: Safety and efficacy of ultrasound prostate ablation for radiorecurrent prostate cancer (PCa) in the presence of gold fiducial markers has not been previously reported. PURPOSE: To evaluate safety, functional, and early-stage oncological outcomes for patients with gold fiducial markers undergoing salvage magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (sTULSA) for radiorecurrent PCa. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were acquired from an ethics-approved, single-center phase-1 study. Eight patients with 18 total gold fiducial markers inside the planned treatment volume were identified. MRI controls were performed at three and 12 months, followed by PSMA-PET-CT imaging and biopsies at 12 months. A control cohort of 13 patients who underwent sTULSA without markers were also identified for safety profile comparison. Adverse events were reported using the Clavien-Dindo classification, and questionnaires including EPIC-26, IPSS, and IIEF-5 were collected. RESULTS: Of 18 markers, 2 (11%) were directly responsible for poor ultrasound penetration. However, there were no local recurrences at 12 months. PSA, prostate volume, and non-perfused volume all decreased over time. At 12 months, 11/18 (61%) of fiducial markers had disappeared via sloughing. The adverse event profile was similar between both patient cohorts, and when controlled for ablation type, no statistical difference in functional outcomes between the two cohorts was observed. CONCLUSION: Patients with radiorecurrent PCa with intraprostatic gold fiducial markers can be successfully treated with TULSA. The early-stage efficacy of sTULSA for patients with intraprostatic gold markers is encouraging and the safety profile is unaffected by marker presence.",0
"BACKGROUND: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)/transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a focal treatment option for MRI-visible localized prostate cancer (PCa). High-quality evidence regarding the clinical efficacy remains limited. OBJECTIVE: To assess medium-term oncological efficacy along with patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective single-center cohort study was performed from 2014 to 2020. Patients with primary International Society of Urological Pathologists (ISUP) grade group (GG) ≤2 by combined MRI/TRUS fusion and systematic prostate biopsy and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10 ng/ml were included. INTERVENTION: MRI/TRUS fusion-guided focal HIFU therapy. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was the cancer-free rate of the HIFU-treated lesion by biopsy after 1 yr. Secondary endpoints included salvage treatment-free survival (STFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), overall survival (OS), and PROMs according to International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement recommendations. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Fifty patients were included (median [range] age 68 [48-80] yr; median PSA 6.5 [1.2-9.9] ng/ml; GG 1 54% [n = 27], and GG 2 46% [n = 23]). The median (range) PSA decrease from baseline to 12 mo was 51% (35.9-72.7%). In total, 37/50 patients (74%) underwent a 1-yr biopsy. PCa was detected in 23 patients (46%; GG 1 20% [n = 10]; GG >1 26% [n = 13]; infield 40% [n = 20]). At a median follow-up of 42 (13-73) mo, PCa was detected in 30 men (60%). Among all patients, 19 (38%) underwent salvage treatments (median [95% confidence interval] STFS 53 [44.3-61.7] mo). MFS and OS were 100% and 98%, respectively. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 sexual domain decreased by 20.8 points (p = 0.372). CONCLUSIONS: MRI/TRUS-guided focal HIFU therapy results in complete cancer ablation in only half of the treated patients after 1 yr, with further recurrences at medium-term follow-up. A decline of potency occurs in a subset of patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: Focal image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy controls cancer in one of two patients. Its impact on urinary continence and erectile function is low.",0
"PURPOSE: Focal therapy (FT) for localized prostate cancer (PCa) is only recommended within the context of clinical trials by international guidelines. We aimed to investigate oncological follow-up and safety data of focal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment. METHODS: We conducted a single-center prospective study of 29 patients with PCa treated with (focal) HIFU between 2016 and 2021. Inclusion criteria were unilateral PCa detected by mpMRI-US-fusion prostate biopsy and maximum prostate specific antigen (PSA) of 15 ng/ml. Follow-up included mpMRI-US fusion-re-biopsies 12 and 24 months after HIFU. No re-treatment of HIFU was allowed. The primary endpoint was failure-free survival (FFS), defined as freedom from intervention due to cancer progression. RESULTS: Median follow-up of all patients was 23 months, median age was 67 years and median preoperative PSA was 6.8 ng/ml. One year after HIFU treatment PCa was still detected in 13/ 29 patients histologically (44.8%). Two years after HIFU another 7/29 patients (24.1%) were diagnosed with PCa. Until now, PCa recurrence was detected in 11/29 patients (37.93%) which represents an FFS rate of 62%.One patient developed local metastatic disease 2 years after focal HIFU. Adverse events (AE) were low with 70% of patients remaining with sufficient erectile function for intercourse and 97% reporting full maintenance of urinary continence. CONCLUSION: HIFU treatment in carefully selected patients is feasible. However, HIFU was oncologically not as safe as expected because of progression rates of 37.93% and risk of progression towards metastatic disease. Thus, we stopped usage of HIFU in our department.",0
"PURPOSE: To describe the national-level patterns of care for local ablative therapy among men with PCa and identify patient- and hospital-level factors associated with the receipt of these techniques. METHODS: We retrospectively interrogated the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for men with clinically localized PCa between 2010 and 2017. The main outcome was receipt of local tumor ablation with either cryo- or laser-ablation, and ""other method of local tumor destruction including high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)"". Patient level, hospital level, and demographic variables were collected. Mixed effect logistic regression models were fitted to identify separately patient- and hospital-level predictors of receipt of local ablative therapy. RESULTS: Overall, 11,278 patients received ablative therapy, of whom 78.8% had cryotherapy, 15.6% had laser, and 5.7% had another method including HIFU. At the patient level, men with intermediate-risk PCa were more likely to be treated with local ablative therapy (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.00-1.11; p = 0.05), as were men with Charlson Comorbidity Index > 1 (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.29-1.43; p < 0.01), men between 71 and 80 years (OR 3.70; 95% CI 3.43-3.99; p < 0.01), men with Medicare insurance (OR 1.38; 95% 1.31-1.46; p < 0.01), and an income < $47,999 (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.06-1.21; p < 0.01). At the hospital-level, local ablative therapy was less likely to be performed in academic/research facilities (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.32-0.64; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Local ablative therapy for PCa treatment is more commonly offered among older and comorbid patients. Future studies should investigate the uptake of these technologies in non-hospital-based settings and in light of recent changes in insurance coverage.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of single ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU) ablation in managing placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 40 PAS patients between April 2017 and October 2021. All the patients received one session of HIFU treatment. Regular follow-up was done after HIFU treatment until normal menstruation returned and placental tissue disappeared. The patient's reproductive-related outcomes were obtained through telephone interviews. RESULTS: The median follow-up time for the 40 patients was 30.50 (15.75-44.00) months and the mean placental tissue elimination time was 45.29 ± 33.32 days. The mean duration of bloody lochia was 13.43 ± 10.01 days, with no incidences of severe bleeding. Notably, Linear regression analysis showed that the residual placenta volume before HIFU was a factor affecting the duration of bloody lochia after HIFU (R2 = 0.284, B = 0.062, P = 0.000). The normal menstrual return time was 58.71 ± 31.14 days. One (2.50%) patient developed an infection. Two (5.00%) patients were subjected to ultrasound-guided suction curettage for persistent vaginal discharge for more than one month without infection. Notably, 7 of the 18 patients who expressed reproductive plans became pregnant during the 4 to 53 months of follow-up without placental abnormalities. The remaining 11 patients were on contraceptives. CONCLUSIONS: Single HIFU is an effective treatment option for managing PAS. However, future studies on further treatment strategies to reduce complications and promote patient recovery after HIFU ablation are desirable.",0
"Characterized by high morbidity, mortality, and disability, stroke usually causes symptoms of cerebral hypoxia due to a sudden blockage or rupture of brain vessels, and it seriously threatens human life and health. Rehabilitation is the essential treatment for post-stroke patients suffering from functional impairments, through which hemiparesis, aphasia, dysphagia, unilateral neglect, depression, and cognitive dysfunction can be restored to various degrees. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is a popular neuromodulatory technology of rehabilitation focusing on the local cerebral cortex, which can improve clinical functions by regulating the excitability of corresponding neurons. Increasing evidence has been obtained from the clinical application of NIBS, especially repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). However, without a standardized protocol, existing studies on NIBS show a wide variation in terms of stimulation site, frequency, intensity, dosage, and other parameters. Its application for neurorehabilitation in post-stroke patients is still limited. With advances in neuronavigation technologies, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, and functional MRI, specific brain regions can be precisely located for stimulation. On the basis of our further understanding on neural circuits, neuromodulation in post-stroke rehabilitation has also evolved from single-target stimulation to co-stimulation of two or more targets, even circuits and the network. The present study aims to review the findings of current research, discuss future directions of NIBS application, and finally promote the use of NIBS in post-stroke rehabilitation.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to ascertain the finding of future diagnosis of malignancy in women who undergo non-surgical treatment for uterine fibroid disease with Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures. DESIGN: Mixed methods retrospective cohort study PATIENTS: 491 women who underwent radiologic intervention for fibroids between 2006 and 2016 at two tertiary care academic hospitals in Boston, MA. EXPOSURE: Uterine artery embolization (UAE) or high intensity focused ultrasound ablation (HIFU) MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subsequent surgical interventions and diagnosis of gynecologic malignancy following IR procedure RESULTS: During the study period, 491 women underwent treatment of fibroids with IR procedures; follow-up information was available for 346 cases. The mean age was 45.3 ± 4.8 years and 69.7% were between 40 to 49 years old. Regarding ethnicity, 58.9% of patients were white and 26.1% Black. The most common symptoms were: abnormal uterine bleeding (87%), pelvic pressure (62.3%) and pelvic pain (60.9%). A total of 106 patients underwent subsequent surgical treatment of fibroids. Out of the 346 patients who had follow-up, four were diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma following their interventional treatment for fibroids (1.2%). An additional two cases of endometrial adenocarcinoma and one case of a premalignant lesion of the endometrium were noted. CONCLUSION: The proportion of patients who went on to be diagnosed with LMS following conservative IR treatments appears to be higher than previously reported. A thorough pre-procedural workup and patient counseling regarding the possibility of underlying uterine malignancy must be undertaken.",0
"Novel treatment options for uterine fibroids, such as uterine artery embolization (UAE), ultrasound-guided and magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU and MRgHIFU), and transcervical radiofrequency ablation (TFA) methods, are widely used in clinical practice. This systematic review and meta-analysis (CRD42022297312) aims to assess and compare reproductive and obstetric outcomes in women who underwent these minimally invasive approaches for uterine fibroids. The search was performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Cochrane guidelines. The articles were selected to meet the following eligibility criteria: (1) research article, (2) human subject research, and (3) the study of pregnancy outcomes after the treatment of uterine fibroids by either one of three methods-UAE, HIFU, and TFA. The analysis of 25 eligible original articles shows a similar rate of live births for UAE, USgHIFU, MRgHIFU, and TFA (70.8%, 73.5%, 70%, and 75%, respectively). The number of pregnancies varied considerably among these studies, as well as the mean age of pregnant women. However, the results of pregnancy outcomes for TFA are insufficient to draw firm conclusions, since only 24 women became pregnant in these studies, resulting in three live births. The miscarriage rate was highest in the UAE group (19.2%). USgHIFU was associated with a higher rate of placental abnormalities compared to UAE (2.8% vs. 1.6%). The pooled estimate of pregnancies was 17.31% to 44.52% after UAE, 18.69% to 78.53% after HIFU, and 2.09% to 7.63% after TFA. The available evidence confirmed that these minimally invasive uterine-sparing treatment options for uterine fibroids are a good approach for patients wishing to preserve their fertility, with comparable reproductive and obstetric outcomes among the different techniques.",0
"PURPOSE: To predict the efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation for uterine leiomyomas based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indicators and imaging features. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with 85 uterine leiomyomas were consecutively enrolled in this retrospective study and underwent DTI scanning before HIFU treatment. Based on whether the non-perfused volume ratio (NPVR) was greater than 70%, all patients were assigned to sufficient ablation (NPVR ≥ 70%) or insufficient ablation (NPVR < 70%) groups. The selected DTI indicators and imaging features were incorporated to construct a combined model. The predictive performance of DTI indicators and the combined model were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: There were 42 leiomyomas in the sufficient ablation group (NPVR ≥ 70%) and 43 leiomyomas in the insufficient ablation group (NPVR < 70%). The fractional anisotropy (FA) and relative anisotropy (RA) values were higher in the sufficient ablation group than in the insufficient ablation group (p < 0.05). Conversely, the volume ratio (VR) and mean diffusivity (MD) values were lower in the sufficient ablation group than those in the insufficient ablation group (p < 0.05). Notably, the combined model composed of the RA and enhancement degree values had high predictive efficiency, with an AUC of 0.915. The combined model demonstrated higher predictive performance than FA and MD alone (p = 0.032 and p < 0.001, respectively) but showed no significant improvement compared with RA and VR (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: DTI indicators, especially the combined model incorporating DTI indicators and imaging features, can be a promising imaging tool to assist clinicians in predicting HIFU efficacy for uterine leiomyomas.",0
"To compare the treatment efficacies of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), HIFU combined with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a), and HIFU combined with GnRH-a and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) for adenomyosis. We conducted a literature search in SCIENCE DIRECT, COCHRANE LIBRARY, WILLEY ONLINE LIBRARY, PUBMED, and TAYLOR FRANCIS. A total of 471 articles identified, 12 were included in a systematic review, and 11 of them deemed quantitively eligible included in the meta-analysis. The efficacies of the three treatment regimens were assessed using the dysmenorrhea and menstrual scores at 3, 6, 12, 24 months. Of the three regimens, HIFU combined with GnRH-a and LNG-IUS provides the best outcome. On dysmenorrhea score at 6 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity with P < 0.00001 (I2 = 100% WMD 21.44 [6.34, 36.53]) with statistical significance P = 0.005. At 12 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.00001 (I2 = 100% WMD 23.47 [6.00, 40.94]) with statistically significant P < 0.008. At 24 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.0005 (I2 = 92% WMD 6.05 [4.81, 7.30]) with statistical significance P < 0.00001. HIFU combined with GnRH-a and LNG-IUS on menstrual score at 3 months was significantly different higher heterogeneity with P < 0.00001 (I2 = 100% WMD 56.23 [16.01, 96.45]) with statistical significance P = 0.006. At 6 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.00001 (I2 = 99% WMD 93.86 [64.15, 123.57]) with statistical significance P < 0.00001. At 12 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.00001 (I2 = 99% WMD 97.13 [67.81, 126.46]) with statistical significance P < 0.00001 compared to treatments with only HIFU and HIFU combined with GnRH-a. HIFU combined with GnRH-a and LNG-IUS treatment is more effective than only HIFU monotherapy and HIFU combined with GnRH-a.",0
"OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the overall pregnancy outcomes after uterus-sparing operative treatment in patients with adenomyosis (AD). DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase for literature from January 2000 to January 2022. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We included all studies reporting reproductive outcomes of uterine-sparing surgery for AD patients with fertility requirements. Surgical treatment classified as complete excision or incomplete removal of AD and non-excisional techniques for induction of necrosis in AD. The latter included physically removing tissue where pathology is present, or disrupting the blood flow to the affected area, involving high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), uterine artery embolization (UAE). Two independent researchers performed study selection according to the screening criteria. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: A total of 13 studies with 1319 patients with AD were included in the present study, comprising 795 women wishing fertility. Pooled estimate of pregnancy, miscarriage and live-birth rates after excisional treatment for women attempting to conceive were 40% (95%CI 29%-52%) , 21% (95%CI 16%-27%) and 70% (95%CI 64%-76%) , respectively. and corresponding rates after non-excisional treatment were 51% (95%CI 42%-60%) , 22% (95%CI 13%-34%) and 71% (95%CI 57%-83%) , respectively. The differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Excisional treatment could be a treatment consideration for patients with symptomatic AD and infertility for several years or repeated failure of ART. Non-excisional techniques may be considered probably for AD-related infertility.",0
"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the ablation of rectus abdominis endometriosis (RAE) as a noninvasive modality. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with RAE who underwent HIFU ablation were followed up for 7 years. The following demographic characteristics of the patients were collected and analyzed: lesion location, size, and number; HIFU ablation; and recurrence. RESULTS: HIFU ablated 65 lesions in 56 patients with a median age of 36.5±9.19 years and a median lesion volume of 8.2 cm3. The main symptom was a palpable painful mass (n=61, 93.9%), which protruded from the skin surface in 6 cases (9.23%). Ultrasound was initially scanned in all patients (n=56, 100%), while 6% (n=3) required magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish the features and range of the masses. Ablation was completed with a median sonication time of 393 s, a treatment time of 46 min, 150 W of power, and 63,525 J of total energy to treat lesions with a median volume of 5.03 cm3. There were no severe complications during the 84-month follow-up period, except for 2 patients who experiences hematuria. The pooled recurrence rate of RAE in this cohort was 1.8% (n=1). CONCLUSIONS: As HIFU is effective and safe and retains the integrity of the abdominal wall, it should be the preferred method for the treatment of RAE.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an obstacle for molecules to pass through from blood to the brain. Focused ultrasound is a new method which temporarily opens the BBB, which makes pharmaceutical delivery or removal of neurodegenerative proteins possible. This study was demonstrated to review our BBB opening procedure with magnetic resonance guided images and find specific patterns in the BBB opening. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed the procedures and results of two clinical studies on BBB opening using focused ultrasound regarding its safety and clinical efficacy. Magnetic resonance images were also reviewed to discover any specific findings. RESULTS: Two clinical trials showed clinical benefits. All clinical trials demonstrated safe BBB opening, with no specific side effects. Magnetic resonance imaging showed temporary T1 contrast enhancement in the sonication area, verifying the BBB opening. Several low-signal intensity spots were observed in the T2 susceptibility-weighted angiography images, which were also reversible and temporary. Although these spots can be considered as microbleeding, evidence suggests these are not ordinary microbleeding but an indicator for adequate BBB opening. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance images proved safe and efficient BBB opening in humans, using focused ultrasound.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to allow therapeutic drug passage can be achieved by inducing microbubble cavitation using focused ultrasound (FUS). This approach can be monitored through analysis of the received signal to distinguish between stable cavitation associated with safe BBB opening and inertial cavitation associated with blood vessel damage. In this study, FUS phantom and animal studies were used to evaluate the experimental conditions that generate several cross-consistent metrics having the potential to be combined for the reliable, automatic control of cavitation levels. METHODS: Typical metrics for cavitation monitoring involve observing changes in the spectrum generated by applying the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to the time domain signal detected using a hydrophone during FUS. A confocal hydrophone was used to capture emissions during a 10 ms FUS burst, sampled at 32 ns intervals, to produce 321,500 points and a high-resolution spectrum when transformed. The FUS spectra were analyzed to show the impact that equipment-transients and well-known DFT-related distortions had on the metrics used for cavitation control. A new approach, physical sparsification (PH-SP), was introduced to sharpen FUS spectral peaks and minimize the effect of these distortions. DISCUSSION: It was demonstrated that the general spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) could be improved by removing the initial noisy phantom hydrophone signal transient. Minor changes in the transient length digitally removed from the sampled values significantly changed the spectral bandwidths of all the harmonically related FUS signals. We evaluated signal processing techniques to minimize the impact these DFT-related distortions on area-under-the-curve (AUC) metric calculations, and we identified the advantages of using PH-SP and proposed new metrics when characterizing FUS spectral properties. The results show many second, third and sub-harmonic metrics provide cross-consistent evidence of changes between stable and inertial cavitation levels. Removing the first harmonic signal component with a hardware low-pass filter allowed the hydrophone gain to be boosted without introducing distortion, leading to an improved analysis of the sub-harmonic signal orders of magnitude smaller in intensity. Metrics that optimized the energy in the real component of the complex-valued PH-SP spectra provided a 32% increase in the sub-harmonic sensitivity compared to standard metrics. CONCLUSION: A preliminary investigation of existing and proposed metrics showed that system noise could be large enough to mask the transition between stable and inertial cavitation. Strong narrowing of sub-harmonic peak shapes on applying physical sparsification (PH-SP) were seen in both phantom and animal studies. However, validating equivalent trends of the metrics with pressure were limited by the increased system noise level in the animal study combined with the natural variability between subjects studied. The combined use of hardware low-pass filters and physical sparsification to selectively removing distortions in the spectrum allowed the optimization of metrics for cavitation monitoring by improving the sub-harmonic sensitivity.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Phase aberration from soft tissue limits the efficacy of histotripsy, a therapeutic ultrasound technique based on acoustic cavitation. Previous work has shown that the acoustic emissions from cavitation can serve as ""point sources"" for aberration correction (AC). This study compared the efficacy of soft tissue AC for histotripsy using acoustic cavitation emissions (ACE) from bubble cloud nucleation and collapse. METHODS: A 750-kHz, receive-capable histotripsy array was pulsed to generate cavitation in ex vivo porcine liver through an intervening abdominal wall. Received ACE signals were used to determine the arrival time differences to the focus and compute corrective delays. Corrections from single pulses and from the median of multiple pulses were tested. DISCUSSION: On average, ACE AC obtained 96% ± 3% of the pressure amplitude obtained by hydrophone-based correction (compared with 71% ± 5% without AC). Both nucleation- and collapse-based corrections obtained >96% of the hydrophone-corrected pressure when using medians of ≥10 pulses. When using single-pulse corrections, nucleation obtained a range of 49%-99% of the hydrophone-corrected pressure, while collapse obtained 95%-99%. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that (i) ACE AC can recover nearly all pressure amplitude lost owing to soft tissue aberration and that (ii) the collapse signal permits robust AC using a small number of pulses.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The potential of transcranial magnetic resonance (MR)-guided histotripsy for brain applications has been described in prior in vivo studies in the swine brain through an excised human skull. The safety and accuracy of transcranial MR-guided histotripsy (tcMRgHt) rely on pre-treatment targeting guidance. In the work described here, we investigated the feasibility and accuracy of using ultrasound-induced low-temperature heating and MR thermometry for histotripsy pre-treatment targeting in ex vivo bovine brain. METHODS: A 15-element, 750-kHz MRI-compatible ultrasound transducer with modified drivers that can deliver both low-temperature heating and histotripsy acoustic pulses was used to treat seven bovine brain samples. The samples were first heated to an approximately 1.6°C temperature increase at the focus, and MR thermometry was used to localize the target. Once the targeting was confirmed, a histotripsy lesion was generated at the focus and visualized on post-histotripsy MR images. DISCUSSION: The accuracy of MR thermometry targeting was evaluated with the mean/standard deviation of the difference between the locus of peak heating identified by MR thermometry and the center of mass of the post-treatment histotripsy lesion, which was 0.59/0.31 mm and 1.31/0.93 mm in the transverse and longitudinal directions, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study determined that MR thermometry could provide reliable pre-treatment targeting for transcranial MR-guided histotripsy treatment.",0
"Emerging holographic haptic interfaces focus ultrasound in air to enable their users to touch, feel, and manipulate three-dimensional virtual objects. However, current holographic haptic systems furnish tactile sensations that are diffuse and faint, with apparent spatial resolutions that are far coarser than would be theoretically predicted from acoustic focusing. Here, we show how the effective spatial resolution and dynamic range of holographic haptic displays are determined by ultrasound-driven elastic wave transport in soft tissues. Using time-resolved optical imaging and numerical simulations, we show that ultrasound-based holographic displays excite shear shock wave patterns in the skin. The spatial dimensions of these wave patterns can exceed nominal focal dimensions by more than an order of magnitude. Analyses of data from behavioral and vibrometry experiments indicate that shock formation diminishes perceptual acuity. For holographic haptic displays to attain their potential, techniques for circumventing shock wave artifacts, or for exploiting these phenomena, are needed.",0
"INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) represents an incisionless treatment option for essential or parkinsonian tremor. The incisionless nature of this procedure has garnered interest from both patients and providers. As such, an increasing number of centers are initiating new MRgFUS programs, necessitating development of unique workflows to optimize patient care and safety. Herein, we describe establishment of a multi-disciplinary team, workflow processes, and outcomes for a new MRgFUS program. METHODS: This is a single-academic center retrospective review of 116 consecutive patients treated for hand tremor between 2020 and 2022. MRgFUS team members, treatment workflow, and treatment logistics were reviewed and categorized. Tremor severity and adverse events were evaluated at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-MRgFUS with the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Part B (CRST-B). Trends in outcome and treatment parameters over time were assessed. Workflow and technical modifications were noted. RESULTS: The procedure, workflow, and team members remained consistent throughout all treatments. Technique modifications were attempted to reduce adverse events. A significant reduction in CRST-B score was achieved at 3 months (84.5%), 6 months (79.8%), and 12 months (72.2%) post-procedure (p < 0.0001). The most common post-procedure adverse events in the acute period (<1 day) were gait imbalance (61.1%), fatigue and/or lethargy (25.0%), dysarthria (23.2%), headache (20.4%), and lip/hand paresthesia (13.9%). By 12 months, the majority of adverse events had resolved with a residual 17.8% reporting gait imbalance, 2.2% dysarthria, and 8.9% lip/hand paresthesia. No significant trends in treatment parameters were found. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the feasibility of establishing an MRgFUS program with a relatively rapid increase in evaluation and treatment of patients while maintaining high standards of safety and quality. While efficacious and durable, adverse events occur and can be permanent in MRgFUS.",0
"BACKGROUND: The morbidity and socioeconomic costs of fractures are considerable. The length of time to healing is an important factor in determining a person's recovery after a fracture. Ultrasound may have a therapeutic role in reducing the time to union after fracture by stimulating osteoblasts and other bone-forming proteins. This is an update of a review previously published in February 2014.   OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of low-intensity ultrasound (LIPUS), high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFUS) and extracorporeal shockwave therapies (ECSW) as part of the treatment of acute fractures in adults.  SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase (1980 to March 2022), Orthopaedic Proceedings, trial registers and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs including participants over 18 years of age with acute fractures (complete or stress fractures) treated with either LIPUS, HIFUS or ECSW versus a control or placebo-control. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodology expected by Cochrane. We collected data for the following critical outcomes: participant-reported quality of life, quantitative functional improvement, time to return to normal activities, time to fracture union, pain, delayed or non-union of fracture. We also collected data for treatment-related adverse events. We collected data in the short term (up to three months after surgery) and in the medium term (later than three months after surgery).   MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 studies, involving 1543 fractures in 1517 participants; two studies were quasi-RCTs. Twenty studies tested LIPUS and one trial tested ECSW; no studies tested HIFUS. Four studies did not report any of the critical outcomes. All studies had unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded for imprecision, risk of bias and inconsistency. LIPUS versus control (20 studies, 1459 participants) We found very low-certainty evidence for the effect of LIPUS on Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measured by SF-36 at up to one year after surgery for lower limb fractures (mean difference (MD) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.85 to 3.97, favours LIPUS; 3 studies, 393 participants). This result was compatible with a clinically important difference of 3 units with both LIPUS or control. There may be little to no difference in time to return to work after people had complete fractures of the upper or lower limbs (MD 1.96 days, 95% CI -2.13 to 6.04, favours control; 2 studies, 370 participants; low-certainty evidence).  There is probably little or no difference in delayed union or non-union up to 12 months after surgery (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.09, favours control; 7 studies, 746 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Although data for delayed and non-union included both upper and lower limbs, we noted that there were no incidences of delayed or non-union in upper limb fractures. We did not pool data for time to fracture union (11 studies, 887 participants; very low-certainty evidence) because of substantial statistical heterogeneity which we could not explain. In upper limb fractures, MDs ranged from 0.32 to 40 fewer days to fracture union with LIPUS. In lower limb fractures, MDs ranged from 88 fewer days to 30 more days to fracture union. We also did not pool data for pain experienced at one month after surgery in people with upper limb fractures (2 studies, 148 participants; very low-certainty evidence) because of substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity. Using a 10-point visual analogue scale, one study reported less pain with LIPUS (MD -1.7, 95% CI -3.03 to -0.37; 47 participants), and the effect was less precise in the other study (MD -0.4, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.53; 101 participants). We found little or no difference in skin irritation (a possible treatment-related adverse event) between groups but judged the certainty of the evidence from this small study to be very low (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.65; 1 study, 101 participants). No studies reported data for functional recovery. Data for treatment adherence were inconsistently reported across studies, but was generally described to be good. Data for costs were reported for one study, with higher direct costs, as well as combined direct and indirect costs, for LIPUS use. ECSW versus control (1 study, 56 participants) We are uncertain whether ECSW reduces pain at 12 months after surgery in fractures of the lower limb (MD -0.62, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.27, favours ECSW); the difference between pain scores was unlikely to be clinically important, and the certainty of the evidence was very low. We are also uncertain of the effect of ECSW on delayed or non-union at 12 months because the certainty of this evidence is very low (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.01; 1 study, 57 participants). There were no treatment-related adverse events. This study reported no data for HRQoL, functional recovery, time to return to normal activities, or time to fracture union. In addition, no data were available for adherence or cost. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We were uncertain of the effectiveness of ultrasound and shock wave therapy for acute fractures in terms of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS), for which few studies reported data. It is probable that LIPUS makes little or no difference to delayed union or non-union. Future trials should be double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials recording validated PROMs and following up all trial participants. Whilst time to union is difficult to measure, the proportion of participants achieving clinical and radiographic union at each follow-up point should be ascertained, alongside adherence with the study protocol and cost of treatment in order to better inform clinical practice.",0
"Thrombosis in cardiovascular disease is an urgent global issue, but treatment progress is limited by the risks of current antithrombotic approaches. The cavitation effect in ultrasound-mediated thrombolysis offers a promising mechanical alternative for clot lysis. Further addition of microbubble contrast agents introduces artificial cavitation nuclei that can enhance the mechanical disruption induced by ultrasound. Recent studies have proposed sub-micron particles as novel sonothrombolysis agents with increased spatial specificity, safety and stability for thrombus disruption. In this article, the applications of different sub-micron particles for sonothrombolysis are discussed. Also reviewed are in vitro and in vivo studies that apply these particles as cavitation agents and as adjuvants to thrombolytic drugs. Finally, perspectives on future developments in sub-micron agents for cavitation-enhanced sonothrombolysis are shared.",0
"Recently, emerging evidence has demonstrated that cavitation actually creates important bidirectional channels on biological barriers for both intratumoral drug delivery and extratumoral biomarker release. To promote the barrier-breaking effects of cavitation for both therapy and diagnosis, we first reviewed recent technical advances of ultrasound and its contrast agents (microbubbles, nanodroplets, and gas-stabilizing nanoparticles) and then reported the newly-revealed cavitation physical details. In particular, we summarized five types of cellular responses of cavitation in breaking the plasma membrane (membrane retraction, sonoporation, endocytosis/exocytosis, blebbing and apoptosis) and compared the vascular cavitation effects of three different types of ultrasound contrast agents in breaking the blood-tumor barrier and tumor microenvironment. Moreover, we highlighted the current achievements of the barrier-breaking effects of cavitation in mediating drug delivery and biomarker release. We emphasized that the precise induction of a specific cavitation effect for barrier-breaking was still challenged by the complex combination of multiple acoustic and non-acoustic cavitation parameters. Therefore, we provided the cutting-edge in-situ cavitation imaging and feedback control methods and suggested the development of an international cavitation quantification standard for the clinical guidance of cavitation-mediated barrier-breaking effects.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Single-element low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is an emerging form of human neuromodulation. Current coupling methods are impractical for clinical bedside use. Here, we evaluate commercially available high-viscosity gel polymer matrices as couplants for human LIFU neuromodulation applications. METHODS: We first empirically tested the acoustic transmission of three densities at 500 kHz and then subjected the gel with the least acoustic attenuation to further tests of the effect of thickness, frequency, de-gassing and production variability. RESULTS: The highest-density gel had the lowest acoustic attenuation (3.3%) with low lateral (<0.5 mm) and axial (<2 mm) beam distortion. Different thicknesses of the gel up to 10 mm did not appreciably affect results. The gel polymers exhibited frequency-dependent attenuation at 1 and 3 MHz up to 86.6%, as well as significant beam distortion >4 mm. Poor de-gassing methods also increased pressure attenuation at 500 kHz up to 59.6%. Standardized methods of making these gels should be established to reduce variability. CONCLUSION: Commercially available de-gassed, high-density gel matrices are a low-cost, easily malleable, low-attenuation and distortion medium for the coupling of single-element LIFU transducers for human neuromodulation applications at 500 kHz.",0
"Nano-based drug delivery systems hold significant promise for cancer therapies. Presently, the poor accumulation of drug-carrying nanoparticles in tumors has limited their success. In this study, based on a combination of the paradigms of intravascular and extravascular drug release, an efficient nanosized drug delivery system with programmable size changes is introduced. Drug-loaded smaller nanoparticles (secondary nanoparticles), which are loaded inside larger nanoparticles (primary nanoparticles), are released within the microvascular network due to temperature field resulting from focused ultrasound. This leads to the scale of the drug delivery system decreasing by 7.5 to 150 times. Subsequently, smaller nanoparticles enter the tissue at high transvascular rates and achieve higher accumulation, leading to higher penetration depths. In response to the acidic pH of tumor microenvironment (according to the distribution of oxygen), they begin to release the drug doxorubicin at very slow rates (i.e., sustained release). To predict the performance and distribution of therapeutic agents, a semi-realistic microvascular network is first generated based on a sprouting angiogenesis model and the transport of therapeutic agents is then investigated based on a developed multi-compartment model. The results show that reducing the size of the primary and secondary nanoparticles can lead to higher cell death rate. In addition, tumor growth can be inhibited for a longer time by enhancing the bioavailability of the drug in the extracellular space. The proposed drug delivery system can be very promising in clinical applications. Furthermore, the proposed mathematical model is applicable to broader applications to predict the performance of drug delivery systems.",0
"Microbubble enhanced high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is of great interest to tissue ablation for solid tumor treatments such as in liver and brain cancers, in which contrast agents/microbubbles are injected into the targeted region to promote heating and reduce prefocal tissue damage. A compressible Euler-Lagrange coupled model has been developed to accurately characterize the acoustic and thermal fields during this process. This employs a compressible Navier-Stokes solver for the ultrasound acoustic field and a discrete singularities model for bubble dynamics. To address the demanding computational cost relevant to practical medical applications, a multilevel hybrid message-passing interface (MPI)-open multiprocessing (OpenMP) parallelization scheme is developed to take advantage of both scalability of MPI and load balancing of OpenMP. At the first level, the Eulerian computational domain is divided into multiple subdomains and the bubbles are subdivided into groups based on which subdomain they fall into. At the next level, in each subdomain containing bubbles, multiple OpenMP threads are activated to speed up the computations of the bubble dynamics. For improved throughput, the OpenMP threads are more heavily distributed to subdomains where the bubbles are clustered. By doing this, MPI load imbalance issue due to uneven bubble distribution is mitigated by OpenMP speedup locally for those subdomains hosting more bubbles than others. The hybrid MPI-OpenMP Euler-Lagrange solver is used to conduct simulations and physical studies of bubble-enhanced HIFU problems containing a large number of microbubbles. The phenomenon of acoustic shadowing caused by the bubble cloud is then analyzed and discussed. Efficiency tests on two different machines with 48 processors are conducted and indicate 2-3 times speedup with the same hardware by introducing an OpenMP parallelization in combination with the MPI parallelization.",0
"Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) and high-intensity focused ultrasound thermal ablation are treatment options with great potential to treat glioblastoma, metastasis, epilepsy, essential tremor, and chronic pain. Results from recent studies show that LITT is a viable alternative to conventional surgical techniques in select patient populations. Although many of the bases for these treatments have existed since the 1930s, the most important advancement in these techniques has occurred in the last 15 years and the coming years hold much promise for these treatments.",0
"Should one recommend stereotactic ablation for Parkinson disease, tremor, dystonia, and obsessive compulsive disorder, in this era of DBS? The answer depends on several variables such as the symptoms to treat, the patient's preferences and expectations, the surgeons' competence and preference, the availability of financial means (by government health care, by private insurance), the geographical issues, and not least the current and dominating fashion at that particular time. Both ablation and stimulation can be either used alone or even combined (provided expertise in both of them) to treat various symptoms of movement and mind disorders.",0
"Modern transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound is an incisionless, ablative treatment modality for a growing number of neurologic disorders. This procedure selectively destroys a targeted volume of cerebral tissue and relies on real-time MR thermography to monitor tissue temperatures. By focusing on a submillimeter target through a hemispheric phased array of transducers, ultrasound waves pass through the skull and avoid overheating and brain damage. High-intensity focused ultrasound techniques are increasingly used to create safe and effective stereotactic ablations for medication-refractory movement and other neurologic and psychiatric disorders.",0
"The sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is a novel swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. It has a fast convergence speed and strong global search ability. However, SSA also has many shortcomings, such as the unstable quality of the initial population, easy to fall into the local optimal solution, and the diversity of the population decreases with the iterative process. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA). ISSA uses Chebyshev chaotic map and elite opposition-based learning strategy to initialize the population and improve the quality of the initial population. In the process of producer location update, dynamic weight factor and Levy flight strategy are introduced to avoid falling into a local optimal solution. The mutation strategy is applied to the scrounger location update process, and the mutation operation is performed on individuals to increase the diversity of the population. In order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of ISSA, it is tested on 23 benchmark functions. The results show that compared with other seven algorithms, ISSA has higher convergence accuracy, faster convergence speed, and stronger stability. Finally, ISSA is used to optimize the sound field of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). The results show that ISSA can effectively improve the focusing performance and reduce the influence of sound field sidelobe, which is of great benefit for HIFU treatment.",0
"Cancer thermal therapy, also known as hyperthermia therapy, has long been exploited to eradicate mass lesions that are now defined as cancer. With the development of corresponding technologies and equipment, local hyperthermia therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and high-intensity focused ultrasound, have has been validated to effectively ablate tumors in modern clinical practice. However, they still face many shortcomings, including nonspecific damages to adjacent normal tissues and incomplete ablation particularly for large tumors, restricting their wide clinical usage. Attributed to their versatile physiochemical properties, biomaterials have been specially designed to potentiate local hyperthermia treatments according to their unique working principles. Meanwhile, biomaterial-based delivery systems are able to bridge hyperthermia therapies with other types of treatment strategies such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Therefore, in this review, we discuss recent progress in the development of functional biomaterials to reinforce local hyperthermia by functioning as thermal sensitizers to endow more efficient tumor-localized thermal ablation and/or as delivery vehicles to synergize with other therapeutic modalities for combined cancer treatments. Thereafter, we provide a critical perspective on the further development of biomaterial-assisted local hyperthermia toward clinical applications.",0
"Treating the brain with focused ultrasound (FUS) at low intensities elicits diverse responses in neurons, astroglia, and the extracellular matrix. In combination with intravenously injected microbubbles, FUS also opens the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and facilitates focal drug delivery. However, an incompletely understood cellular specificity and a wide parameter space currently limit the optimal application of FUS in preclinical and human studies. In this perspective, we discuss how different FUS modalities can be utilized to achieve short- and long-term improvements, thereby potentially treating brain disorders. We review the ongoing efforts to determine which parameters induce neuronal inhibition versus activation and how mechanoreceptors and signaling cascades are activated to induce long-term changes, including memory improvements. We suggest that optimal FUS treatments may require different FUS modalities and devices, depending on the targeted brain area or local pathology, and will be greatly enhanced by new techniques for monitoring FUS efficacy.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Ultrasound-mediated cavitation has been harnessed to improve the delivery of various therapeutics, including the extravasation of small molecule drugs and nanoparticles (<1 µm) into soft tissue. This study investigated whether cavitation could also enhance the extravasation of larger (>10 µm) therapeutic particles, representative of radio- or chemo-embolic particles, in a tissue-mimicking phantom. METHODS: High-speed (103-106 frames/s) optical imaging was used to observe the motion of glass microspheres with diameters of 15-32 or 105-107 µm in an agar phantom under exposure to high-intensity focused ultrasound (0.5 MHz) at a range of peak negative pressures (1.9-2.8 MPa) in the presence of SonoVue microbubbles. RESULTS: In contrast to the microstreaming reported to be responsible for nanoparticle transport, the formation and translation of bubble clouds were found to be primarily responsible for the motion of glass microspheres. The bubble clouds were seen both to create channels in the phantom and to travel along them under the action of primary acoustic radiation force, either propelling or entraining microspheres with them. Collisions between microspheres were also seen to promote cloud formation and cavitation activity. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-mediated cavitation can promote the transport of solid microparticles in tissue-mimicking material. Further work is needed to understand the influence of tissue mechanical properties and ultrasound exposure parameters on the extent and uniformity of particle distribution that can be achieved.",0
"BACKGROUND: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) contains various growth factors and inflammatory regulators, which can effectively reduce inflammation in joints and promote tissue repair. Multiple studies have proved its effectiveness in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) are non-invasive and safe physical therapy methods for KOA. This study is the first to propose the treatment of KOA with physical stimulation after PRP treatment, and to observe the clinical efficacy of the treatment method. METHODS: This is a protocol paper that outlines a randomized controlled trial, patients will be assigned randomly to the PRP group, PRP+LIFU group, PRP+TENS group, and PRP+LIFU combined TENS group. The patients will be followed at 12-week and 24-week time points to evaluate the primary and secondary outcomes of the study. The primary outcome is the VAS pain score. Secondary outcomes include Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and International Knee Documentation Committee scores (IKDC). After baseline examination, all patients will sign a written informed consent for study participation after a full explanation of the treatment protocol. We have planned a total of 120 patients (30 patients per group). DISCUSSION: The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of different physical stimulation after PRP treatment for KOA. The data will be published after the completion of the study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry. REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2200065119 (registered date: 10/28/2022).",0
"OBJECTIVE: The ability to predict final lesion characteristics during magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy for the treatment of essential tremor remains technically challenging, yet it is essential in order to avoid off-target ablation and to ensure adequate treatment. The authors sought to evaluate the technical feasibility and utility of intraprocedural diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the prediction of final lesion size and location. METHODS: Lesion diameter and distance from the midline were measured on both intraprocedural and immediate postprocedural diffusion and T2-weighted sequences. Bland-Altman analysis was utilized to determine differences in measurement between intraprocedural and immediate postprocedural images with both sequences. RESULTS: Lesion size increased on both the postprocedural diffusion and T2-weighted sequences, although the difference was smaller on the T2-weighted sequence. There was only a small difference in intraprocedural and postprocedural lesion distance from the midline on both the diffusion and T2-weighted sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Intraprocedural DWI is both feasible and useful with regard to predicting final lesion size and providing an early indication of lesion location. Further research should determine the value of intraprocedural DWI in predicting delayed clinical outcomes.",0
"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) systems have been approved for therapeutic ultrasound delivery to cause tissue ablation or induced hyperthermia. Microbubble agents have also been used in combination with sonication exposures. These require temperature feedback and monitoring to prevent unstable cavitation and prevent excess tissue heating. Previous work has utilized lower power and pressure to oscillate microbubbles and transfer energy to endothelial cells in the absence of thermally induced damage that can radiosensitize tumors. This work investigated whether reduced acoustic power and pressure on a commercial available MR-integrated HIFU system could result in enhanced radiation-induced tumor response after exposure to ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles (USMB) therapy. A commercially available MR-integrated HIFU system was used with a hyperthermia system calibration provided by the manufacturer. The ultrasound transducer was calibrated to reach a peak negative pressure of - 750 kPa. Thirty male New Zealand white rabbits bearing human derived PC3 tumors were grouped to receive no treatment, 14 min of USMB, 8 Gy of radiation in a separate irradiation cabinet, or combined treatments. In vivo temperature changes were collected using MR thermometry at the tumor center and far-field muscle region. Tissues specimens were collected 24 h post radiation therapy. Tumor cell death was measured and compared to untreated controls through hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical analysis. The desired peak negative pressure of - 750 kPa used for previous USMB occurred at approximately an input power of 5 W. Temperature changes were limited to under 4 °C in ten of twelve rabbits monitored. The median temperature in the far-field muscle region of the leg was 2.50 °C for groups receiving USMB alone or in combination with radiation. Finally, statistically significant tumor cell death was demonstrated using immunohistochemical analysis in the combined therapy group compared to untreated controls. A commercial MR-guided therapy HIFU system was able to effectively treat PC3 tumors in a rabbit model using USMB therapy in combination with radiation exposures. Future work could find the use of reduced power and pressure levels in a commercial MR-guided therapy system to mechanically stimulate microbubbles and damage endothelial cells without requiring high thermal doses to elicit an antitumor response.",0
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an emerging therapeutic tool for the effective thermal ablation of pathological tissue. For accurate localization of the target and safe control of the HIFU dosage, real-time imaging guidance during the HIFU exposure is desired. Ultrasound imaging has the capability to guide clinicians toward a lesion in real time, but is not an ideal option, as HIFU application causes strong interference, thereby substantially distorting the images used for guidance. Thus, this study introduces singular value decomposition-based filtering capable of restoring ultrasound harmonic images from HIFU interference without undesirable spectral distortion. The results were experimentally validated with a custom-made phantom, indicating that this approach effectively eliminates HIFU-induced artifacts, which is essential for real-time monitoring of the therapeutic process.",0
"Purpose: Aortic maximal rate of systolic distention (MRSD) is a prognosis factor of ascending aorta dilatation with magnetic resonance imaging. Its calculation requires precise continuous tracking of the aortic diameter over the cardiac cycle, which is not feasible by focused ultrasound. We aimed to develop an automatic aortic acquisition using ultrafast ultrasound imaging (UUI) to provide access to the aortic MRSD. Methods: A phased array probe and developed sequences at 2000 frames/s were used. A created interface automatically tracked the anterior and posterior aortic walls over the cardiac cycle. Tissue Doppler allowed a precise estimation of the walls' movements. MRSD was the maximum derivative of the aortic diameter curve over time. To assess its feasibility, 34 patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and 31 controls were consecutively included to evaluate the BAV-associated aortopathy at the sinus of Valsalva, the tubular ascending aorta, and the aortic arch. Results: UUI acquisitions and the dedicated interface allow tracking of the aortic diameter and calculating the MRSD for the BAV patients and controls (mean age of 34 vs. 43 years, p = 0.120). A trend toward lower deformation in the different aortic segments was observed, as expected. Still, only the MRSD with UUI was significantly different at the sinus of Valsalva in this small series: (0.61 .103.s-1 [0.37-0.72] for BAV patients vs. 0.92 .103.s-1 [0.72-1.02] for controls, p = 0.025). Conclusion: Aortic deformation evaluated with UUI deserves attention with a simple and automated measurement technique that could assess the segmental aortic injury associated with BAV.",0
"Mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is the most thoroughly studied mechanosensitive channel in prokaryotes. Owing to its small molecular weight, clear mechanical gating mechanism, and nanopore forming ability upon opening, accumulating studies are implemented in regulating cell function by activating mechanosensitive channel of large conductance in mammalian cells. This study aimed to investigate the potentials of mechanosensitive channel of large conductance as a nanomedicine and a mechano-inducer in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells from the view of molecular pathways and acoustics. The stable cytoplasmic vacuolization model about NSCLC A549 cells was established via the targeted expression of modified mechanosensitive channel of large conductance channels in different subcellular organelles. Subsequent morphological changes in cellular component and expression levels of cell death markers are analyzed by confocal imaging and western blots. The permeability of mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) exhibited a vital role in cytoplasmic vacuolization formation. Furthermore, mechanosensitive channel of large conductance channel can be activated by low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) in A549 cells, and the suppression of A549 tumors in vivo was achieved by LIFU with sound pressure as low as 0.053 MPa. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying non-apoptotic cell death, and validate the nanochannel-based non-invasive ultrasonic strategy for cancer therapy.",0
"Surface tension provides microbubbles (MB) with a perfect spherical shape. Here, we demonstrate that MB can be engineered to be nonspherical, endowing them with unique features for biomedical applications. Anisotropic MB were generated via one-dimensionally stretching spherical poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) MB above their glass transition temperature. Compared to their spherical counterparts, nonspherical polymeric MB displayed superior performance in multiple ways, including i) increased margination behavior in blood vessel-like flow chambers, ii) reduced macrophage uptake in vitro, iii) prolonged circulation time in vivo, and iv) enhanced blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation in vivo upon combination with transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS). Our studies identify shape as a design parameter in the MB landscape, and they provide a rational and robust framework for further exploring the application of anisotropic MB for ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery and imaging applications.",0
"INTRODUCTION: Cerebral diseases have been threatening public physical and psychological health in the recent years. With the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), it is particularly hard for therapeutic proteins like peptides, enzymes, antibodies, etc. to enter the central nervous system (CNS) and function in diagnosis and treatment in cerebral diseases. Fortunately, the past decade has witnessed some emerging strategies of delivering macromolecular therapeutic proteins across the BBB. AREAS COVERED: Based on the structure, functions, and substances transport mechanisms, various enhanced delivery strategies of therapeutic proteins were reviewed, categorized by molecule-mediated delivery strategies, carrier-mediated delivery strategies, and other delivery strategies. EXPERT OPINION: As for molecule-mediated delivery strategies, development of genetic engineering technology, optimization of protein expression and purification techniques, and mature of quality control systems all help to realize large-scale production of recombinant antibodies, making it possible to apply to the clinical practice. In terms of carrier-mediated delivery strategies and others, although nano-carriers/adeno-associated virus (AAV) are also promising candidates for delivering therapeutic proteins or genes across the BBB, some issues still remain to be further investigated, including safety concerns related to applied materials, large-scale production costs, quality control standards, combination therapies with auxiliary delivery strategies like focused ultrasound, etc.",0
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising non-invasive therapeutic technique in clinical applications. Challenges in stimulation or ablation HIFU therapy are to accurately target the treatment spot, flexibly deliver or fast-move focus points in the treatment region, and monitor therapy progress in real-time. In this paper, we develop an array-based HIFU system integrated with real-time ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. The array-based HIFU transducer can be dynamically focused in a lateral range of ∼16 mm and an axial range of ∼40 mm via electronically adjusting the excitation phase map. To monitor the HIFU therapy progress in real-time, sequential HIFU transmission, PA imaging, PA thermometry, and US imaging are implemented to display the dual-modal images and record the local temperature changes. Co-registered dual-modal images show structural and functional information and thus can guide the HIFU therapy for precise positioning and dosage control. Besides therapy, the multi-element HIFU transducer can also be used to acquire US images to precisely align the imaging coordinates with the HIFU coordinates. Phantom experiments validate the precise and dynamic steering capability of HIFU ablation. We also show that dual-modal imaging can guide HIFU in the designated region and monitor the temperature in biological tissue in real-time.",0
"Within the last decade, ultrasound has been ""rediscovered"" as a technique for brain therapies. Modern technologies allow focusing ultrasound through the human skull for highly focal tissue ablation, clinical neuromodulatory brain stimulation, and targeted focal blood-brain-barrier opening. This article gives an overview on the state-of-the-art of the most recent application: ultrasound neuromodulation as a new brain therapy. Although research centers have existed for decades, the first treatment centers were not established until 2020, and clinical applications are spreading rapidly.",0
"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive and non-ionizing sonic energy-based therapeutic technology for inducing thermal and non-thermal effects in tissues. Depending on the parameters, HIFU can ablate tissues by heating them to >55 °C to induce denaturation and coagulative necrosis, improve radio- and chemo-sensitizations and local drug delivery from nanoparticles at moderate hyperthermia (∼41-43 °C), and mechanically fragment cells using acoustic cavitation (also known as histotripsy). HIFU has already emerged as an attractive modality for treating human & veterinary cancers, infectious diseases, and neuromodulation. Herein, we comprehensively review the role of HIFU in enhancing drug delivery and immunomodulation in soft and calcified tissues. Specifically, the ability of HIFU to improve adjuvant treatments from various classes of therapeutic agents are described. These crucial insights highlight the opportunities and challenges of HIFU technology and its potential to support new clinical trials and translation to patients.",0
"Our aim is to summarize the new European Resuscitation Council (ERC) 2021 guidelines on paediatric life support. In children, exhaustion of compensatory mechanisms in respiratory or circulatory failure leads to cardiac arrest. Recognition and treatment of children in critical condition are the most important element of its prevention. With the ABCDE approach, life-threatening problems can be identified and treated using simple interventions (bag-mask ventilation, intraosseous access, fluid bolus, etc.). Important new recommendations: 4-hand ventilation during bag-mask ventilation, target saturation of 94-98% during oxygen therapy, and fluid bolus of 10 ml/kg. In pediatric basic life support, if there is no normal breathing after 5 initial rescue breaths in absence of signs of life, chest compression should be initiated immediately using primarily two-thumb encircling method for infants. Recommended rate is 100-120/min, ratio of compression to ventilation is 15 : 2. Pediatric advanced life support is a teamwork. The structure of the algorithm is unchanged, high-quality chest compression is still a paramount. Recognition and treatment of potential reversible causes (4H-4T) and the decisive role of focused ultrasound are emphasized. New features: recommendation of 4-hand technique bag-mask ventilation, role of capnography, and age-dependent ventilatory rate in the case of continuous chest compression after endotracheal intubation. Drug therapy is unchanged, the fastest way to administer adrenaline during resuscitation is via intraosseous access. Treatment after return of spontaneous circulation decisively influences neurological outcome. Patient care is further based on the ABCDE scheme. Important goals are maintaining normoxia, normocapnia, avoiding hypotension, hypoglycemia, fever and use of targeted temperature management. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(12): 463-473.",0
"Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) uses ultrasonic pulsations at lower intensities than ultrasound and is being tested as a reversible and precise neuromodulatory technology. Although LIFU-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening has been explored in detail, no standardized technique for blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) opening has been established to date. Therefore, this protocol presents a method for successful BSCB disruption using LIFU sonication in a rat model, including descriptions of animal preparation, microbubble administration, target selection and localization, as well as BSCB disruption visualization and confirmation. The approach reported here is particularly useful for researchers who need a fast and cost-effective method to test and confirm target localization and precise BSCB disruption in a small animal model with a focused ultrasound transducer, evaluate the BSCB efficacy of sonication parameters, or explore applications for LIFU at the spinal cord, such as drug delivery, immunomodulation, and neuromodulation. Optimizing this protocol for individual use is recommended, especially for advancing future preclinical, clinical, and translational work.",0
"Endogenous neural stem cells (eNSCs) in the adult brain, which have the potential to self-renew and differentiate into functional, tissue-appropriate cell types, have raised new expectations for neurological disease therapy. Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFUS)-induced blood-brain barrier modulation has been reported to promote neurogenesis. Although these studies have reported improved behavioral performance and enhanced expression of brain biomarkers after LIFUS, indicating increased neurogenesis, the precise mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated eNSC activation as a mechanism for neurogenesis after LIFUS-induced blood-brain barrier modulation. We evaluated the specific eNSC markers, Sox-2 and nestin, to confirm the activation of eNSCs. We also performed 3'-deoxy-3'[18F] fluoro-L-thymidine positron emission tomography ([18F] FLT-PET) to evaluate the activation of eNSCs. The expression of Sox-2 and nestin was significantly upregulated 1 week after LIFUS. After 1 week, the upregulated expression decreased sequentially; after 4 weeks, the upregulated expression returned to that of the control group. [18F] FLT-PET images also showed higher stem cell activity after 1 week. The results of this study indicated that LIFUS could activate eNSCs and induce adult neurogenesis. These results show that LIFUS may be useful as an effective treatment for patients with neurological damage or neurological disorders in clinical settings.",0
"Cyclodextrins (CDs) are suitable drug carriers because of their doughnut-shaped cavities with hydrophilic outer and hydrophobic inner surfaces. Temperature-responsive CD-based drug carriers are expected to be one of the most promising candidates for drug delivery systems. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the inclusion complex of β-CD with cyclophosphamide (CP) at temperatures from 300 K to 400 K to investigate the temperature dependency of the release behaviour of CP and structural changes of β-CD in an aqueous solution. We analysed the distance between the centres of mass of β-CD and CP and the radius of gyration of β-CD. The CP molecule was released from the β-CD cavity at 400 K, whereas two different inclusion complexes, partially and completely, were observed at T < 400 K. β-CD encapsulating a CP molecule had a more spherical shape and rigidity than β-CD without a CP, and the rigidity of their inclusion complex decreased with increasing temperature. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the behaviours of the β-CD/CP complex and drug release at the molecular level and can facilitate the development of new temperature-responsive drug delivery systems with CD nanocarriers triggered by localised temperature increases using focused ultrasound.",0
"RNAi has considerable potential as a cancer therapeutic approach, but effective and efficient delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA) to tumors remains a major hurdle. It remains a challenge to prepare a functional siRNA complex, target enough dose to the tumor, and stimulate its internalization into tumor cells and its release to the cytoplasm. Here, we show how these key barriers to siRNA delivery can be overcome with a complex─comprising siRNA, cationic lipids, and pH-responsive peptides─that is suited to tumor uptake enhancement via focused ultrasound (FUS). The complex provides effective nucleic acid encapsulation, nuclease protection, and endosomal escape such that gene silencing in cells is substantially more effective than that obtained with either equivalent lipoplexes or commercial reagents. In mice bearing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts, both lipid and ternary, lipid:peptide:siRNA complexes, prepared with near-infrared fluorescently labeled siRNA, accumulate in tumors following FUS treatments. Therefore, combining a well-designed lipid:peptide:siRNA complex with FUS tumor treatments is a promising route to achieve robust in vivo gene delivery.",0
"OBJECTIVES: Previously in rodent and swine models, we have shown that external low intensity focused ultrasound (liFUS) can be used to modulate pain responses. To ensure no adverse heating events occur with liFUS modulation in a non-invasive manner, we perform initial work in swine to show that magnetic resonance thermometry imaging (MRTI) is capable of measuring <2.0 °C changes at the L5 DRG. Further, we show that our device can be constructed in an MR-compatible fashion to minimize artifact. METHODS: Three MRTI techniques (referenceless, corrected proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS), and PRFS) were applied to assess accuracy of detecting thermal changes at the L5 DRG in unheated euthanized swine. A region of interest (ROI) that includes the L5 DRG was delineated, within which MRTI temperature changes were spatially averaged (ground truth 0 °C). In separate experiments with phantoms, B0 field-inhomogeneity, RF transmit (B1+) and fast gradient echo (fSPGR) magnitude images were acquired to downselect liFUS device materials that produce the least MRI artifacts. RESULTS: Referenceless, corrected PRFS, and PRFS MRTI resulted in temperature measurements of 0.8 ± 1.1 °C, 1.1 ± 1.3 °C and 5.2 ± 5 °C, respectively. Both materials caused B0 perturbation but minimal B1+ and MRTI artifacts. The presence of imaging artifacts did not preclude thermal imaging of the region. SIGNIFICANCE: We provide preliminary data suggesting that referenceless MRTI can adequately detect small thermal changes at the DRG that may occur with neuromodulation, which is one of the first steps in creating a table of safe parameters for liFUS therapy in humans.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Acoustic attenuation in the propagation path of focused ultrasound ablation surgery determines the energy loss toward the focal region and is critical to the consequent treatment outcomes. In situ non-invasive, reliable, and accurate measurement is challenging for multi-layered heterogeneous tissues within the focusing angle. METHODS: A novel measurement approach is proposed and its performance is evaluated using ex vivo porcine tenderloin and bovine heart. A big boiling bubble (i.e., larger than a few millimeters in size) was produced at the focus as a strong reflector inside the tissue, and the echo amplitudes were used to determine the acoustic attenuation. Two models, acoustic ray and energy loss, were developed to derive the equivalent acoustic attenuation coefficient for a focused beam. RESULTS: The measured acoustic attenuation coefficients of ex vivo porcine tenderloin and bovine heart at 0.97 MHz and a thickness of 3 cm are 0.159 ± 0.002 and 0.250 ± 0.005 Np/cm, respectively, which are all within the scope of measured values in the literature. In addition, the echo amplitude is sensitive to the conditions of the propagation path, and the inverse acoustic attenuation coefficient of the silicone gel pad placed in front of the tissue sample was 0.807 ± 0.002 Np/cm, which is comparable to the measurement using the insertion substitution method, 0.766 ± 0.003 Np/cm. CONCLUSION: Our proposed approach could determine the tissue acoustic attenuation for focused ultrasound ablation surgery reliably and accurately in situ. The easy operating protocol may allow clinical translation and adoption for improved safety and efficacy.",0
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising and representative non-invasive therapeutic method for treating cancer with a high degree of efficacy. This non-invasive method induces tumour cell necrosis by increasing the local temperature and mechanical pressure. However, the clinical application of HIFU is limited given its low penetration depth and the incidence of off-target side effects. With their promising structural adjustability and targeting ability, nanomedicines have been adopted to improve the ablative efficacy of HIFU in the treatment of cancer. By selectively changing the acoustic environment (tissue structure, density and blood supply) of tumour tissue, these nanomedicines may allow for lower HIFU doses and treatment duration, while additionally achieving a higher degree of efficacy. The use of nanomedicines may also enable cancer theranostics of HIFU, allowing for precise cancer therapeutics. The present review aimed to provide an overview of advances in nanomedicines for HIFU cancer treatment and theranostics, stating their current limitations and future perspectives.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Efficient, sustained and long-term delivery of therapeutics to the brain remains an important challenge to treatment of diseases such as brain cancer, stroke and neurodegenerative disease. Focused ultrasound can assist movement of drugs into the brain, but frequent and long-term use has remained impractical. Single-use intracranial drug-eluting depots show promise but are limited for the treatment of chronic diseases as they cannot be refilled non-invasively. Refillable drug-eluting depots could serve as a long-term solution, but refilling is hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which prevents drug refills from accessing the brain. In this article, we describe how focused ultrasound enables non-invasive loading of intracranial drug depots in mice. METHODS: Female CD-1 mice (n = 6) were intracranially injected with click-reactive and fluorescent molecules that are capable of anchoring in the brain. After healing, animals were treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound and microbubbles to temporarily increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and deliver dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-Cy7. The mice were perfused, and the brains were imaged via ex vivo fluorescence imaging. RESULTS: Fluorescence imaging indicated small molecule refills are captured by intracranial depots as long as 4 wk after administration and are retained for up to 4 wk based on fluorescence imaging. Efficient loading was dependent on both focused ultrasound and the presence of refillable depots in the brain as absence of either prevented intracranial loading. CONCLUSION: The ability to target and retain small molecules at predetermined intracranial sites with pinpoint accuracy provides opportunities to continuously deliver drugs to the brain over weeks and months without excessive BBB opening and with minimal off-target side effects.",0
"Harmonic motion imaging (HMI) is an ultrasound-based elasticity imaging technique that utilizes oscillatory acoustic radiation force to estimate the mechanical properties of tissues, as well as monitor high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment. Conventionally, in HMI, a focused ultrasound (FUS) transducer generates oscillatory tissue displacements, and an imaging transducer acquires channel data for displacement estimation, with each transducer being driven with a separate system. The fixed position of the FUS focal spot requires mechanical translation of the transducers, which can be a time-consuming and challenging procedure. In this study, we developed and characterized a new HMI system with a multi-element FUS transducer with the capability of electronic focal steering of ±5 mm and ±2 mm from the geometric focus in the axial and lateral directions, respectively. A pulse sequence was developed to drive both the FUS and imaging transducers using a single ultrasound data acquisition (DAQ) system. The setup was validated on a tissue-mimicking phantom with embedded inclusions. Integrating beam steering with the mechanical translation of the transducers resulted in a consistent high contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the inclusions with Young's moduli of 22 and 44 kPa within a 5-kPa background while the data acquisition speed is increased by 4.5-5.2-fold compared to the case when only mechanical movements were applied. The feasibility of simultaneous generation of multiple foci and tracking the induced displacements is demonstrated in phantoms for applications where imaging or treatment of a larger region is needed. Moreover, preliminary feasibility is shown in a human subject with a breast tumor, where the mean HMI displacement within the tumor was about 4 times lower than that within perilesional tissues. The proposed HMI system facilitates data acquisition in terms of flexibility and speed and can be potentially used in the clinic for breast cancer imaging and treatment.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the changes of cervical soluble immune markers after focused ultrasound (FU) treatment to explore the underlying local immune effects of FU in the treatment of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection-related low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL). METHODS: A total of 35 patients diagnosed with HR-HPV infection-related histological LSIL who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this prospective study and treated with FU. The authors used cytometric bead array to measure T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine (interleukin [IL] 2, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon γ) and Th2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10) levels in the cervicovaginal lavage of patients before and 3 months after FU treatment. RESULTS: After FU treatment, the concentrations of Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-6 were significantly lower than those before FU treatment (P = 0.044 and P = 0.028, respectively). HR-HPV infection was cleared in 27 patients, with a clearance rate of 77.1% (27 of 35). The concentration of IL-4 in patients with HR-HPV clearance after FU treatment was significantly lower than that in patients without HR-HPV clearance (P = 0.045). CONCLUSION: FU can inhibit the production of certain Th2 cytokines and may improve the local immune status of the cervix, thereby eliminating HR-HPV infection.",0
"BACKGROUND: Helplessness and hopelessness are states closely related to depressive disorders. They ensue following the anticipated absence of valid behavioral options to alleviate an aversive state. One neural structure involved in the detection of such options, is the cingulate cortex (CC), which conveys the evaluation of behavior against the value of its outcome. Accordingly, CC-related EEG measures are thought to correlate to feedback evaluation but also to anxious and conflict-related states, signaling the need for further adaptation to current requirements. Against this background, this study investigated the role of CC functioning in the emergence and prevention of helpless/hopeless states by applying low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (litFUS) neuromodulation prior to a learned helplessness task. METHOD: In a randomized controlled double blind experimental setup with 55 participants, litFUS was used to inhibit the right lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC), a region closely connected to CC modulation. Participants were instructed to play 8 games of chess against a computer that was unbeatable to them, while an EEG was recorded. Theta oscillation in midline electrodes, playing performance and self-rate measures on cognitive, affective and physiological parameters were assessed. RESULTS: The results show a considerable influence of litFUS neuromodulation of the lPFC on midline theta activity (Fz and Pz electrode position) which in turn correlated to several psychological variables including self-report data on emotion, cognition, and arousal as well as behavioral measures (playing performance). LIMITATIONS: Due to the small sample size and sample characteristics, results cannot be generalized to the field of clinical application. A replication of results in larger samples and in context of other sonication parameters is needed to increase the robustness of results and to maximize the efficacy of litFUS application. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the development of learned helplessness/hopelessness could be positively influenced in its course by litFUS neuromodulation of the right lPFC. In line with previous results, especially the posterior midline electrode Pz seems to be an interesting target for further research in this field as theta activity at this electrode is correlated to control perception and motivated behavior. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use neuromodulation to monitor and manipulate the development of helplessness in the laboratory.",0
"It is of great social significance and clinical value to explore new effective treatments for depression. Low-intensity focused ultrasound stimulation (LIFUS) has been indicated to have notable neuroprotective effects on depression. However, little is known about how different strategies of LIFUS affect the therapeutic effect. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether the effects of LIFUS on depression-like behaviors are associated with the intensity and the underlying mechanisms. We established the depression rats model using the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and applied the LIFUS with high/low intensity (Ispta = 500 and 230 mW/cm2, respectively) to the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) after CUS. We found that two intensities of LIFUS both could significantly improve depression-like behaviors to a comparable degree. We further found that theta oscillation synchronization and synaptic functional plasticity in the hippocampal vCA1-mPFC pathway were significantly improved by chronic LIFUS which mainly due to the alternation of synaptic structural plasticity and the expression of post-synaptic proteins in the mPFC. These results suggest that LIFUS ameliorates the depression-like behaviors associated with improving the synaptic plasticity in the vCA1-mPFC pathway. Our study provides preclinical evidence and a theoretical basis for applying LIFUS for depression treatment.",0
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffuse midline glioma H3K27-altered (DMG) is an aggressive, inoperable, predominantly paediatric brain tumour. Treatment strategies are limited, resulting in a median survival of only 11 months. Currently, radiotherapy (RT), often combined with temozolomide, is considered the standard of care but remains palliative, highlighting the urgency for new therapies. Radiosensitisation by olaparib, an inhibitor of PARP1 and subsequently PAR-synthesis, is a promising treatment option. We assessed whether PARP1 inhibition enhances radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo following focused ultrasound mediated blood-brain barrier opening (FUS-BBBO). METHODS: Effects of PARP1 inhibition were evaluated in vitro using viability, clonogenic, and neurosphere assays. In vivo olaparib extravasation and pharmacokinetic profiling following FUS-BBBO was measured by LC-MS/MS. Survival benefit of FUS-BBBO combined with olaparib and RT was assessed using a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) DMG mouse model. RESULTS: Treatment with olaparib in combination with radiation delayed tumour cell proliferation in vitro through the reduction of PAR. Prolonged exposure of low olaparib concentration was more efficient in delaying cell growth than short exposure of high concentration. FUS-BBBO increased olaparib bioavailability in the pons by 5.36-fold without observable adverse effects. A Cmax of 54.09 μM in blood and 1.39 μM in the pontine region was achieved following administration of 100 mg/kg olaparib. Although RT combined with FUS-BBBO mediated olaparib extravasation delayed local tumour growth, survival benefits were not observed in an in vivo DMG PDX model. CONCLUSIONS: Olaparib effectively radiosensitises DMG cells in vitro and reduces primary tumour growth in vivo when combined with RT. Further studies are needed to investigate the therapeutic benefit of olaparib in suitable preclinical PDX models.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Focused ultrasound ablation (FUSA) is an emerging treatment for neurological and psychiatric diseases. We describe the initial experience from a pilot, open-label, single-center clinical trial of unilateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) FUSA in patients with treatment-refractory epilepsy. METHODS: Two adult subjects with treatment-refractory, focal onset epilepsy were recruited. The subjects received ANT FUSA using the Exablate Neuro (Insightec) system. We determined the safety and feasibility (primary outcomes), and changes in seizure frequency (secondary outcome) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Safety was assessed by the absence of side effects, that is, new onset neurological deficits or performance deterioration on neuropsychological testing. Feasibility was defined as the ability to create a lesion within the anterior nucleus. The monthly seizure frequency was compared between baseline and postthalamotomy. RESULTS: The patients tolerated the procedure well, without neurological deficits or serious adverse events. One patient experienced a decline in verbal fluency, attention/working memory, and immediate verbal memory. Seizure frequency reduced significantly in both patients; one patient was seizure-free at 12 months, and in the second patient, the frequency reduced from 90-100 seizures per month to 3-6 seizures per month. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first known clinical trial to assess the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of ANT FUSA in adult patients with treatment-refractory focal onset epilepsy.",0
"BACKGROUND: Focused ultrasound (FUS-T) and stereotactic radiosurgery thalamotomy (SRS-T) targeting the ventral intermediate nucleus are effective incisionless surgeries for essential tremor (ET). However, their efficacy for tremor reduction and, importantly, adverse event incidence have not been directly compared. OBJECTIVE: To present a comprehensive systematic review with network meta-analysis examining both efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of FUS-T vs SRS-T for treating medically refractory ET. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, using the PubMed and Embase databases. We included all primary FUS-T/SRS-T studies with approximately 1-year follow-up, with unilateral Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale or Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor scores prethalamotomy/post-thalamotomy and/or AEs. The primary efficacy outcome was Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale A+B score reduction. AEs were reported as an estimated incidence. RESULTS: Fifteen studies of 464 patients and 3 studies of 62 patients met inclusion criteria for FUS-T/SRS-T efficacy comparison, respectively. Network meta-analysis demonstrated similar tremor reduction between modalities (absolute tremor reduction: FUS-T: -11.6 (95% CI: -13.3, -9.9); SRS-T: -10.3 (95% CI: -14.2, -6.0). FUS-T had a greater 1-year adverse event rate, particularly imbalance and gait disturbances (10.5%) and sensory disturbances (8.3%). Contralateral hemiparesis (2.7%) often accompanied by speech impairment (2.4%) were most common after SRS-T. There was no correlation between efficacy and lesion volume. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review found similar efficacy between FUS-T and SRS-T for ET, with trend toward higher efficacy yet greater adverse event incidence with FUS-T. Smaller lesion volumes could mitigate FUS-T off-target effects for greater safety.",0
"BACKGROUND: Ultrasound beam aberration correction is vital when focusing ultrasound through the skull bone in transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (tcMRgFUS) applications. Current methods make transducer element phase adjustments to compensate for the variation in skull properties (shape, thickness, and acoustic properties), but do not account for variations in the internal brain anatomy. PURPOSE: Our objective is to investigate the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain anatomy on beam focusing in tcMRgFUS treatments. METHODS: Simulations were conducted with imaging data from 20 patients previously treated with focused ultrasound for disabling tremor. The Hybrid Angular Spectrum (HAS) method was used to test the effect of including cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and brain anatomy in determining the element phases used for aberration correction and beam focusing. Computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images from patient treatments were used to construct a segmented model of each patient's head. The segmented model for treatment simulation consisted of water, skin, fat, brain, CSF, diploë, and cortical bone. Transducer element phases used for treatment simulation were determined using time reversal from the desired focus, generating a set of phases assuming a homogeneous brain in the intracranial volume, and a second set of phases assigning CSF acoustic properties to regions of CSF. In addition, for three patients, the relative effect of separately including CSF speed of sound values compared to CSF attenuation values was found. RESULTS: We found that including CSF acoustic properties (speed of sound and attenuation) during phase planning compared to phase correction without considering CSF increased the absorbed ultrasound power density ratios at the focus over a range of 1.06 to 1.29 (mean of 17% ± 6%) for 20 patients. Separately considering the CSF speed of sound and CSF attenuation showed that the increase was due almost entirely to including the CSF speed of sound; considering only the CSF attenuation had a negligible effect. CONCLUSIONS: Based on HAS simulations, treatment planning phase determination using morphologically realistic CSF and brain anatomy yielded an increase of up to 29% in the ultrasound focal absorbed power density. Future work will be required to validate the CSF simulations.",0
"PURPOSE: The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ultrasound ciliary plasty (UCP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma for three consecutive years. METHODS: Sixty-one patients (62 eyes) with primary and secondary glaucoma were enrolled to undergo UCP. The primary outcome measures were intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, success rates, glaucoma medication use and visual acuity after UCP. An IOP reduction of 20% compared to the baseline value without re-intervention was considered a successful treatment. Complete success was defined as cessation of antiglaucoma medications. Secondary outcome measures included intraoperative and postoperative complications. Measurements were performed preoperatively and at the first week, and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients (41 eyes) were evaluated 36-month after UCP. The mean ± SD values of IOP preoperatively at 1 day, 1 week, 1; 3; 6; 12; 18; 24; 30 and 36 months postoperatively were 22.7 ± 5.0 mmHg, 17.1 ± 4.2 mmHg (p < 0.001), 15.7 ± 4.8 mmHg (p < 0.001), 18.8 ± 4.8 mmHg (p < 0.001), 17.3 ± 3.7 mmHg (p < 0.001), 16.9 ± 3.2 mmHg (p < 0.001), 16.6 ± 2.7 mmHg (p < 0.001), 16.3 ± 3.0 mmHg (p < 0.001), 15.8 ± 3.4 mmHg (p < 0.001), 15.3 ± 2.1 mmHg (p < 0.001) and 16.3 ± 3.0 mmHg (p < 0.001), respectively. The mean IOP at the last follow-up was reduced by 28.5%. The qualified success rate was 64.0%. All patients at 36-month follow-up visit required the use of antiglaucoma medications - none of the patients achieved complete success. The decrease in the number of antiglaucoma medications was statistically significant at each follow-up visit compared to the baseline. Choroid detachment was observed in three patients (4.8%), while macular oedema was observed in three patients (4.8%) after the procedure. No other major intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound ciliary plasty seems to be an effective and well-tolerated method to reduce IOP in patients with refractory glaucoma. Further studies with a larger group are needed to confirm the efficacy of this procedure.",0
"PRCIS: Ultrasound cyclo plasty (UCP) using high-intensity focused ultrasound is an effective and safe procedure in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma, even in those with high myopia. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UCP in glaucoma patients with high myopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we enrolled 36 eyes divided into 2 groups based on axial length: group A (≥26.00 mm) and group B (<26.00 mm). We collected data about visual acuity, Goldmann applanation tonometry, biomicroscopy, and visual field before the procedure and at 1, 7, 30, 60, 90, 180, and 365 days after the procedure. RESULTS: Mean IOP significantly decreased in both groups after treatment ( P <0.001). Mean IOP reduction from baseline to the last visit was 9.8±6.6 mmHg (38.7%) in group A and 9.6±6.3 mmHg (34.8%) in group B ( P <0.001). Mean IOP at the last visit was 15.8±4.1 mmHg in the myopic group and 18.1±5.6 mmHg in the non-myopic one. Regarding the number of IOP-lowering eyedrops being taken by our patients, statistically significant differences were found between groups A and B neither at baseline (2.8±0.9 and 2.6±1.0; P =0.568) nor 1 year after the procedure (2.5±1.1 and 2.6±1.1; P =0.762). No major complications occurred. All minor adverse events resolved within a few days. CONCLUSION: UCP seems to be an effective and well-tolerated strategy to lower IOP in glaucoma patients with high myopia.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and microwave ablation (MWA) for the treatment of small liver metastatic tumors. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with small liver metastatic tumors who underwent HIFU (n = 28) or MWA (n = 30) at Suining Central Hospital between January 2016 and December 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Operation times were longer and hospitalization costs were lower in the HIFU group than in the MWA group. Postoperative hospitalization times, tumor ablation rates, and clinical response and control rates did not differ significantly between the two groups 1 month after surgery. Rates of postoperative complications such as fever, liver dysfunction, injury, pain, and biliary leakage did not differ between the two groups. The 1- and 3-year cumulative survival rates were 96.4% and 52.4%, respectively, after HIFU and 93.3% and 51.4%, respectively, after MWA, which did not represent significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: HIFU is a safe and feasible method of treating small liver metastatic tumors. Compared with MWA, HIFU was associated with lower hospitalization costs, reduced trauma, and fewer postoperative complications, making it a promising new local ablative treatment option for liver metastatic tumors.",0
"Pulsed high intensity focused ultrasound (pHIFU) is a non-invasive method that allows to permeabilize pancreatic tumors through inertial cavitation and thereby increase the concentration of systemically administered drug. In this study the tolerability of weekly pHIFU-aided administrations of gemcitabine (gem) and their influence on tumor progression and immune microenvironment were investigated in genetically engineered KrasLSL.G12D/þ; p53R172H/þ; PdxCretg/þ (KPC) mouse model of spontaneously occurring pancreatic tumors. KPC mice were enrolled in the study when the tumor size reached 4-6 mm and treated once a week with either ultrasound-guided pHIFU (1.5 MHz transducer, 1 ms pulses, 1% duty cycle, peak negative pressure 16.5 MPa) followed by administration of gem (n = 9), gem only (n = 5) or no treatment (n = 8). Tumor progression was followed by ultrasound imaging until the study endpoint (tumor size reaching 1 cm), whereupon the excised tumors were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene expression profiling (Nanostring PanCancer Immune Profiling panel). The pHIFU + gem treatments were well tolerated; the pHIFU-treated region of the tumor turned hypoechoic immediately following treatment in all mice, and this effect persisted throughout the observation period (2-5 weeks) and corresponded to areas of cell death, according to histology and IHC. Enhanced labeling by Granzyme-B was observed within and adjacent to the pHIFU treated area, but not in the non-treated tumor tissue; no difference in CD8 + staining was observed between the treatment groups. Gene expression analysis showed that the pHIFU + gem combination treatment lead to significant downregulation of 162 genes related to immunosuppression, tumorigenesis, and chemoresistance vs gem only treatment.",0
"Intracerebral vector delivery in nonhuman primates has been a major challenge. We report successful blood-brain barrier opening and focal delivery of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vectors into brain regions involved in Parkinson's disease using low-intensity focus ultrasound in adult macaque monkeys. Openings were well tolerated with generally no associated abnormal magnetic resonance imaging signals. Neuronal green fluorescent protein expression was observed specifically in regions with confirmed blood-brain barrier opening. Similar blood-brain barrier openings were safely demonstrated in three patients with Parkinson's disease. In these patients and in one monkey, blood-brain barrier opening was followed by 18F-Choline uptake in the putamen and midbrain regions based on positron emission tomography. This indicates focal and cellular binding of molecules that otherwise would not enter the brain parenchyma. The less-invasive nature of this methodology could facilitate focal viral vector delivery for gene therapy and might allow early and repeated interventions to treat neurodegenerative disorders.",0
"Focal therapy for localized prostate cancer (PC) using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is gaining in popularity as it is noninvasive and associated with fewer side effects than standard whole-gland treatments. However, better methods to evaluate response to HIFU ablation are an unmet need. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and gastrin-releasing peptide receptors are both overexpressed in PC. In this study, we evaluated a novel approach of using both 68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/MRI in each patient before and after HIFU to assess the accuracy of target tumor localization and response to treatment. Methods: Fourteen men, 64.5 ± 8.0 y old (range, 48-78 y), with newly diagnosed PC were prospectively enrolled. Before HIFU, the patients underwent prostate biopsy, multiparametric MRI, 68Ga-PSMA11, and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI. Response to treatment was assessed at a minimum of 6 mo after HIFU with prostate biopsy (n = 13), as well as 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI (n = 14). The SUVmax and SUVpeak of known or suspected PC lesions were collected. Results: Pre-HIFU biopsy revealed 18 cancers, of which 14 were clinically significant (Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4). Multiparametric MRI identified 18 lesions; 14 of them were at least score 4 in the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System. 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI each showed 23 positive intraprostatic lesions; 21 were congruent in 13 patients, and 5 were incongruent in 5 patients. Before HIFU, 68Ga-PSMA11 identified all target tumors, whereas 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI missed 2 tumors. After HIFU, 68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/MRI both identified clinically significant residual disease in 1 patient. Three significant ipsilateral recurrent lesions were identified, whereas 1 was missed by 68Ga-PSMA11. The pretreatment level of prostate-specific antigen decreased significantly after HIFU, by 66%. Concordantly, the pretreatment SUVmax decreased significantly after HIFU for 68Ga-PSMA11 (P = 0.001) and 68Ga-RM2 (P = 0.005). Conclusion: This pilot study showed that 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI identified the target tumor for HIFU in 100% and 86% of cases, respectively, and accurately verified response to treatment. PET may be a useful tool in the guidance and monitoring of treatment success in patients receiving focal therapy for PC. These preliminary findings warrant larger studies for validation.",0
"OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative safety and effectiveness of 2 prostate cancer treatment ablation modalities: irreversible electroporation (IRE) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).  METHODS: Two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) on IRE and HIFU were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted in PubMed and EMBASE. Independent reviewers assessed literature eligibility and abstracted safety and effectiveness data. Oncological, safety, functional, and quality of life (QOL) outcomes were examined for each technology. MAs were conducted where data quality and availability allowed, using normal methods and a random/mixed effects model, and quality assessments performed. RESULTS: Fifty-five publications (n = 22 IRE; n = 33 HIFU) were included in the SLRs, and MAs were conducted on negative in-field post-procedure biopsy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level reduction, potency, urinary continence, and AE rate outcomes. MAs revealed that IRE patients had lower mean percent PSA level reductions, higher mean rates of in-field negative post-treatment biopsy, and higher rates of potency maintenance than HIFU patients. Most adverse events (AEs) reported were comparable and minor (Grades I, II), with urinary tract infection, dysuria, hematuria, and incontinence or urgency most frequently reported. The proportion of patients experiencing a severe AE (≥Grade III) ranged from 0 to 8% after IRE and HIFU. Both modalities were associated with positive functional outcomes as well as maintenance of QOL after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both IRE and HIFU were found to produce favorable effectiveness outcomes and have low complication rates while minimally impacting patient urinary and erectile function and maintaining overall QOL. These real-world findings can help guide clinical decision making and improve disease management for patients with prostate cancer.",0
"PURPOSE: In older patients who do not wish to undergo watchful waiting, focal therapy could be an alternative to the more morbid radical treatment. We evaluated the role of focal therapy in patients 70 years and older as an alternative management modality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 649 patients across 11 UK sites receiving focal high-intensity focused ultrasound or cryotherapy between June 2006 and July 2020 reported within the UK-based HEAT (HIFU Evaluation and Assessment of Treatment) and ICE (International Cryotherapy Evaluation) registries were evaluated. Primary outcome was failure-free survival, defined by need for more than 1 focal reablation, progression to radical treatment, development of metastases, need for systemic treatment, or prostate cancer-specific death. This was compared to the failure-free survival in patients undergoing radical treatment via a propensity score weighted analysis. RESULTS: Median age was 74 years (IQR: 72, 77) and median follow-up 24 months (IQR: 12, 41). Sixty percent had intermediate-risk disease and 35% high-risk disease. A total of 113 patients (17%) required further treatment. Sixteen had radical treatment and 44 required systemic treatment. Failure-free survival was 82% (95% CI: 76%-87%) at 5 years. Comparing patients who had radical therapy to those who had focal therapy, 5-year failure-free survival was 96% (95% CI: 93%-100%) and 82% (95% CI: 75%-91%) respectively (P < .001). Ninety-three percent of those in the radical treatment arm had received radiotherapy as their primary treatment with its associated use of androgen deprivation therapy, thereby leading to potential overestimation of treatment success in the radical treatment arm, especially given the similar metastases-free and overall survival rates seen. CONCLUSIONS: We propose focal therapy to be an effective management option for the older or comorbid patient who is unsuitable for or not willing to undergo radical treatment.",0
"INTRODUCTION: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as part of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is an important sequence for the detection of prostate cancer (PCa). The objective of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in biopsy-proven PCa undergoing TULSA-PRO (MR-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of the prostate) at 3.0 T after 1, 3, and 6-12 months posttreatment. METHODS: Nineteen patients underwent follow-up examinations after 1, 3, and 6-12 months including mpMRI at 3.0 T and urological-clinical examinations with quantitative analysis of ADCs. RESULTS: In PCa, a significant increase of ADC values after 6-12 months was measured after TULSA-PRO treatment by 29.1% (pre-TULSA: 0.79 ± 0.16 × 10-3 mm2/s, 6-12 months: 1.02 ± 0.35 × 10-3 mm2/s), while the corresponding value in the reference tissue decreased by 48.5% (pre-TULSA: 1.20 ± 0.15 × 10-3 mm2/s, 6-12 months: 0.91 ± 0.29 × 10-3 mm2/s). The mean ADC values in the early follow-up groups at 1 and 3 months did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: DWI with ADC as part of mpMRI can serve as a biomarker to dynamically monitor the follow-up after TULSA after 6-12 months. For early posttreatment progression, it is not suitable due to too many confounding variables.",0
"BACKGROUND: Several reports are available regarding the treatment decision regret of patients receiving conventional treatments for localized prostate cancer (PCa); yet data on patients undergoing focal therapy (FT) are sparse. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the treatment decision satisfaction and regret among patients who underwent FT for PCa with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) or cryoablation (CRYO). DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We identified consecutive patients who underwent HIFU or CRYO FT as the primary treatment for localized PCa at three US institutions. A survey with validated questionnaires, including the five-question Decision Regret Scale (DRS), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), was mailed to the patients. The regret score was calculated based on the five items of the DRS, and regret was defined as a DRS score of >25. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess the predictors of treatment decision regret. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of 236 patients, 143 (61%) responded to the survey. Baseline characteristics were similar between responders and nonresponders. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 43 (26-68) mo, the treatment decision regret rate was 19.6%. On a multivariable analysis, higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at nadir after FT (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2, p = 0.009), presence of PCa on follow-up biopsy (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.5-10.6, p = 0.006), higher post-FT IPSS (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.37, p = 0.03), and newly diagnosed impotence (OR 6.67, 95% CI 1.57-27, p = 0.03) were independent predictors of treatment regret. The type of energy treatment (HIFU/CRYO) was not a predictor of regret/satisfaction. Limitations include retrospective abstraction. CONCLUSIONS: FT for localized PCa is well accepted by the patients, with a low regret rate. Higher PSA at nadir, presence of cancer on follow-up biopsy, bothersome postoperative urinary symptoms, and impotence after FT were independent predictors of treatment decision regret. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we looked at the factors affecting satisfaction and regret in patients with prostate cancer undergoing focal therapy. We found that focal therapy is well accepted by the patients, while presence of cancer on follow-up biopsy as well as bothersome urinary symptoms and sexual dysfunction can predict treatment decision regret.",0
"To retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided microwave (MWA), radiofrequency (RF), and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation in the treatment of uterine leiomyoma and to provide a suggestion for the selection of clinical treatment of uterine leiomyoma. The retrospective cohort studies on the efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound in treating uterine leiomyoma was collected through a literature search in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library, Scopus, and Web of Science, and selected according to the specified inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. Evaluate the study quality, extract relevant data, and RevMan 5.4.1 was used to conduct this meta-analysis. Compared with HIFU therapy, the complete or partial ablation rate and recurrence rate of uterine leiomyoma treated with RFA/MWA were statistically different (P < 0.05). Compared with RF, the overall efficacy of HIFU in treating uterine leiomyoma was not as good as that of RF. There was no significant difference between the RFA therapy and the MWA. HIFU still has mild and short-term complications, such as abdominal pain, bloody vaginal discharge, sacral pain, and fever. Although myomectomy is usually the first choice for uterine preservation, RFA/MWA and HIFU have also been shown to relieve clinical symptoms significantly, shorten treatment time, reduce complications, and improve prognosis.",0
"Gene delivery via focused ultrasound (FUS) mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening is a disruptive therapeutic modality. Unlocking its full potential will require an understanding of how FUS parameters (e.g., peak-negative pressure (PNP)) affect transfected cell populations. Following plasmid (mRuby) delivery across the BBB with 1 MHz FUS, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to ascertain that distributions of transfected cell types were highly dependent on PNP. Cells of the BBB (i.e., endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes) were enriched at 0.2 MPa PNP, while transfection of cells distal to the BBB (i.e., neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) was augmented at 0.4 MPa PNP. PNP-dependent differential gene expression was observed for multiple cell types. Cell stress genes were upregulated proportional to PNP, independent of cell type. Our results underscore how FUS may be tuned to bias transfection toward specific brain cell types in vivo and predict how those cells will respond to transfection.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the functional brain imaging techniques to effectively measure neuronal activity, but its low spatial resolution makes it difficult to localize evoked excitatory neurons or areas of abnormal firing. Multimodal imaging techniques are expected to combine the high spatial resolution (mm level) of focused ultrasound (FUS) with the high temporal resolution (ms level) of EEG. The technique must be performed under the premise that ultrasound stimulation does not affect neuronal firing, and there is an urgent need to determine the threshold of this ultrasound stimulation parameter. METHODS: In this paper, the subthalamic nucleus neuronal firing model and the bilayer sonophore model are combined to numerically simulate the neuronal firing rhythm under the conditions of different stimulation parameters. The correlation and frequency differences of neuronal firing rhythms with and without ultrasound stimulation were compared and used as an index to evaluate the degree of change, and the final range of effective threshold parameters for ultrasound stimulation of neurons but not inducing neuronal firing was obtained. RESULTS: The results showed that the correlation of neuronal firing rhythms in both conditions with and without stimulation decreased and the frequency difference increased with increasing ultrasound parameters such as duty cycle, intensity, center frequency and pulse repetition frequency. CONCLUSION: An effective range of stimulation threshold parameters can be obtained based on the correlation coefficients and frequency difference matrices under different parameter combinations. SIGNIFICANCE: The threshold can further promote the safe and effective application of FUS for multimodal electrophysiological imaging.",0
"Focused ultrasound (FUS)-enabled liquid biopsy (sonobiopsy) is an emerging technique for the noninvasive and spatiotemporally controlled diagnosis of brain cancer by inducing blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption to release brain tumor-specific biomarkers into the blood circulation. The feasibility, safety, and efficacy of sonobiopsy were demonstrated in both small and large animal models using magnetic resonance-guided FUS devices. However, the high cost and complex operation of magnetic resonance-guided FUS devices limit the future broad application of sonobiopsy in the clinic. In this study, a neuronavigation-guided sonobiopsy device is developed and its targeting accuracy is characterized in vitro, in vivo, and in silico. The sonobiopsy device integrated a commercially available neuronavigation system (BrainSight) with a nimble, lightweight FUS transducer. Its targeting accuracy was characterized in vitro in a water tank using a hydrophone. The performance of the device in BBB disruption was verified in vivo using a pig model, and the targeting accuracy was quantified by measuring the offset between the target and the actual locations of BBB opening. The feasibility of the FUS device in targeting glioblastoma (GBM) tumors was evaluated in silico using numerical simulation by the k-Wave toolbox in glioblastoma patients. It was found that the targeting accuracy of the neuronavigation-guided sonobiopsy device was 1.7 ± 0.8 mm as measured in the water tank. The neuronavigation-guided FUS device successfully induced BBB disruption in pigs with a targeting accuracy of 3.3 ± 1.4 mm. The targeting accuracy of the FUS transducer at the GBM tumor was 5.5 ± 4.9 mm. Age, sex, and incident locations were found to be not correlated with the targeting accuracy in GBM patients. This study demonstrated that the developed neuronavigation-guided FUS device could target the brain with a high spatial targeting accuracy, paving the foundation for its application in the clinic.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Histotripsy is an emerging non-invasive, non-ionizing and non-thermal focal tumor therapy. Although histotripsy targeting is currently based on ultrasound (US), other imaging modalities such as cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) have recently been proposed to enable the treatment of tumors not visible on ultrasound. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a multi-modality phantom to facilitate the assessment of histotripsy treatment zones on both US and CBCT imaging. METHODS: Fifteen red blood cell phantoms composed of alternating layers with and without barium were manufactured. Spherical 25-mm histotripsy treatments were performed, and treatment zone size and location were measured on CBCT and ultrasound. Sound speed, impedance and attenuation were measured for each layer type. RESULTS: The average ± standard deviation signed difference between measured treatment diameters was 0.29 ± 1.25 mm. The Euclidean distance between measured treatment centers was 1.68 ± 0.63 mm. The sound speed in the different layers ranged from 1491 to 1514 m/s and was within typically reported soft tissue ranges (1480-1560 m/s). In all phantoms, histotripsy resulted in sharply delineated treatment zones, allowing segmentation in both modalities. CONCLUSION: These phantoms will aid in the development and validation of X-ray-based histotripsy targeting techniques, which promise to expand the scope of treatable lesions beyond only those visible on ultrasound.",0
"Historically, pathological brain lesions provided the foundation for localization of symptoms and therapeutic lesions were used as a treatment for brain diseases. New medications, functional neuroimaging and deep brain stimulation led to a decline in lesions in the past few decades. However, recent advances have improved our ability to localize lesion-induced symptoms, including localization to brain circuits rather than individual brain regions. Improved localization can lead to more precise treatment targets, which may mitigate traditional advantages of deep brain stimulation over lesions such as reversibility and tunability. New tools for creating therapeutic brain lesions such as high intensity focused ultrasound allow for lesions to be placed without a skin incision and are already in clinical use for tremor. Although there are limitations and caution is warranted, improvements in lesion-based localization are refining our therapeutic targets and improved technology is providing new ways to create therapeutic lesions, which together may facilitate the return of the lesion.",0
"This paper provides an overview of current robot-assisted high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) systems for image-guided therapies. HIFU is a minimally invasive technique that relies on the thermo-mechanical effects of focused ultrasound waves to perform clinical treatments, such as tumor ablation, mild hyperthermia adjuvant to radiation or chemotherapy, vein occlusion, and many others. HIFU is typically performed under ultrasound (USgHIFU) or magnetic resonance imaging guidance (MRgHIFU), which provide intra-operative monitoring of treatment outcomes. Robot-assisted HIFU probe manipulation provides precise HIFU focal control to avoid damage to surrounding sensitive anatomy, such as blood vessels, nerve bundles, or adjacent organs. These clinical and technical benefits have promoted the rapid adoption of robot-assisted HIFU in the past several decades. This paper aims to present the recent developments of robot-assisted HIFU by summarizing the key features and clinical applications of each system. The paper concludes with a comparison and discussion of future perspectives on robot-assisted HIFU.",0
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly regulated physical and functional boundarythat tightly controls the transport of materials between the blood and the brain. There is an increasing recognition that the BBB is dysfunctional in a wide range of neurological disorders; this dysfunction can be symptomatic of the disease but can also play a role in disease etiology. BBB dysfunction can be exploited for the delivery of therapeutic nanomaterials. Forexample, there can be a transient, physical disruption of the BBB in diseases such as brain injury and stroke, which allows temporary access of nanomaterials into the brain. Physicaldisruption of the BBB through external energy sources is now being clinically pursued toincrease therapeutic delivery into the brain. In other diseases, the BBB takes on new properties that can beleveraged by delivery carriers. For instance, neuroinflammation induces the expression ofreceptors on the BBB that can be targeted by ligand-modified nanomaterials, and theendogenous homing of immune cells into the diseased brain can be hijacked for the delivery ofnanomaterials. Lastly, BBB transport pathways can be altered to increase nanomaterial transport. In this review, we will describe changes that can occur in the BBB in disease, and how these changes have been exploited by engineered nanomaterials forincreased transport into the brain.",0
"Focused ultrasound stimulation (FUS) activates mechanosensitive ion channels and is emerging as a method of noninvasive neuromodulation. In preclinical studies, FUS of the spleen (sFUS) activates an anti-inflammatory neural pathway which suppresses acute and chronic inflammation. However, the relevance of sFUS for regulating inflammatory responses in humans is unknown. Here, we used a modified diagnostic ultrasound imaging system to target the spleen of healthy human subjects with 3 min of continuously swept or stationary focused pulsed ultrasound, delivered at three different energy levels within allowable safety exposure limits. Potential anti-inflammatory effects of sFUS were assessed by measuring sFUS-elicited changes in endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in whole blood samples from insonified subjects. We found that stimulation with either continuously swept or focused pulsed ultrasound has an anti-inflammatory effect: sFUS lowers TNF production for >2 h, with TNF returning to baseline by 24 h following sFUS. This response is independent of anatomical target (i.e., spleen hilum or parenchyma) or ultrasound energy level. No clinical, biochemical, or hematological parameters are adversely impacted. This is the first demonstration that sFUS suppresses the normal inflammatory response in humans, with potential implications for noninvasive bioelectronic therapy of inflammatory disorders.",0
"Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation is a promising therapeutic modality for human brain disorders because of its noninvasiveness, long penetration depth, and versatile spatial control capability through beamforming and beam steering. However, the skull presents a major hurdle for successful applications of ultrasound stimulation. Specifically, skull-induced focal aberration limits the capability for accurate and versatile targeting of brain subregions. In addition, there lacks a fully functional preclinical neuromodulation system suitable to conduct behavioral studies. Here, we report a miniature ultrasound system for neuromodulation applications that is capable of highly accurate multiregion targeting based on acoustic holography. Our work includes the design and implementation of an acoustic lens for targeting brain regions with compensation for skull aberration through time-reversal recording and a phase conjugation mirror. Moreover, we utilize MEMS and 3D-printing technology to implement a 0.75-g lightweight neuromodulation system and present in vivo characterization of the packaged system in freely moving mice. This preclinical system is capable of accurately targeting the desired individual or multitude of brain regions, which will enable versatile and explorative behavior studies using ultrasound neuromodulation to facilitate widespread clinical adoption.",0
"BACKGROUND: Mild hyperthermia has been demonstrated to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy in various cancer types. One localized, non-invasive method of administering mild hyperthermia is magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU). However, challenges for ultrasound such as beam deflection, refraction and coupling issues may result in a misalignment of the HIFU focus and the tumor during hyperthermia. Currently, the best option is to stop the treatment, wait for the tissue to cool, and redo the treatment planning before restarting the hyperthermia. This current workflow is both time-consuming and unreliable. PURPOSE: An adaptive targeting algorithm was developed for MRgHIFU controlled hyperthermia treatments for cancer therapeutics. This algorithm executes in real time while hyperthermia is being administered to ensure that the focus is within our target region. If a mistarget is detected, the HIFU system will electronically steer the focus of the HIFU beam to the correct target. The goal of this study was to quantify the accuracy and precision of the adaptive targeting algorithm's ability to correct a purposely misplanned hyperthermia treatment in real-time using a clinical MRgHIFU system. METHODS: A gelatin phantom with acoustic properties matched to the average speed of sound in human tissue was used to test the adaptive targeting algorithm's accuracy and precision. The target was purposely offset 10 mm away from the focus at the origin, in four orthogonal directions, allowing the algorithm to correct for this mistarget. In each direction, 10 data sets were collected for a total sample size of 40. Hyperthermia was administered with a target temperature set at 42°C. The adaptive targeting algorithm was run during the hyperthermia treatment and 20 thermometry images were collected after the beam steering occurred. The location of the focus was quantified by calculating the center of heating on the MR thermometry data. RESULTS: The average calculated trajectory passed to the HIFU system was 9.7 mm ± 0.4 mm where the target trajectory was 10 mm. The accuracy of the adaptive targeting algorithm after the beam steering correction was 0.9 mm and the precision was 1.6 mm. CONCLUSION: The adaptive targeting algorithm was implemented successfully and was able to correct the 10 mm mistargets with high accuracy and precision in gelatin phantoms. The results demonstrate the capability to correct the MRgHIFU focus location during controlled hyperthermia.",0
"Pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound (pHIFU) uses nonlinearly distorted millisecond-long ultrasound pulses of moderate intensity to induce inertial cavitation in tissue without administration of contrast agents. The resulting mechanical disruption permeabilizes the tissue and enhances the diffusion of systemically administered drugs. This is especially beneficial for tissues with poor perfusion such as pancreatic tumors. Here we characterize the performance of a dual-mode ultrasound array designed for image-guided pHIFU therapies in producing inertial cavitation and ultrasound imaging. The 64-element linear array (1.071 MHz, aperture of 14.8 mm x 51.2 mm, and pitch of 0.8 mm) with elevational focal length of 50 mm was driven by the Verasonics V-1 ultrasound system with extended burst option. The attainable focal pressures and electronic steering range in linear and nonlinear operating regimes (relevant to pHIFU treatments) were characterized through hydrophone measurements, acoustic holography, and numerical simulations. The steering range at ±10% from the nominal focal pressure was found to be ±6 mm axially and ±11 mm azimuthally. Focal waveforms with shock fronts of up to 45 MPa, and peak negative pressures up to 9 MPa were achieved at focusing distances of 38-75 mm from the array. Cavitation behaviors induced by isolated 1 ms pHIFU pulses in optically transparent agarose gel phantoms were observed by high-speed photography across a range of excitation amplitudes and focal distances. For all focusing configurations the appearance of sparse, stationary cavitation bubbles occurred at the same P_ threshold of 2 MPa. As the output level increased, a qualitative change in cavitation behavior occurred, to pairs and sets of proliferating bubbles. The pressure P_ at which this transition was observed corresponded to substantial nonlinear distortion and shock formation in the focal region and was thus dependent on the focal distance of the beam ranging within 3-4 MPa for azimuthal F-numbers of 0.74 to 1.5. The array was capable of B-mode imaging at 1.5 MHz of centimeter-sized targets in phantoms and in vivo pig tissues at depths of 3 cm to 7 cm, relevant to pHIFU applications in abdominal targets.",0
"BACKGROUND: Transcranial focused ultrasound has the potential to noninvasively modulate deep brain circuits and impart sustained, neuroplastic effects. OBJECTIVE: Bring the approach closer to translations by demonstrating sustained modulation of deep brain circuits and choice behavior in task-performing non-human primates. METHODS: Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound of 30 s in duration was delivered in a controlled manner into deep brain targets (left or right lateral geniculate nucleus; LGN) of non-human primates while the subjects decided whether a left or a right visual target appeared first. While the animals performed the task, we recorded intracranial EEG from occipital screws. The ultrasound was delivered into the deep brain targets daily for a period of more than 6 months. RESULTS: The brief stimulation induced effects on choice behavior that persisted up to 15 minutes and were specific to the sonicated target. Stimulation of the left/right LGN increased the proportion of rightward/leftward choices. These effects were accompanied by an increase in gamma activity over visual cortex. The contralateral effect on choice behavior and the increase in gamma, compared to sham stimulation, suggest that the stimulation excited the target neural circuits. There were no detrimental effects on the animals' discrimination performance over the months-long course of the stimulation. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that brief, 30-s ultrasonic stimulation induces neuroplastic effects specifically in the target circuits, and that the stimulation can be applied daily without detrimental effects. These findings encourage repeated applications of transcranial ultrasound to malfunctioning deep brain circuits in humans with the goal of providing a durable therapeutic reset.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Nakagami imaging is an appealing monitoring and evaluation technique for high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment when bubbles are present in ultrasound images. This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of thermal lesion detection using Nakagami imaging. METHODS: Simulations were conducted to explore and quantify the influence of the bubbles and the subresolvable effect at the boundary of the thermal lesion on thermal lesion detection. The thermal ablation experiments were conducted in phantom and porcine liver ex vivo. RESULTS: In the simulation, the estimated lateral and axial size of the thermal lesion in the Nakagami image was 4.91 and 4.79 mm, close to the actual size (5 × 5 mm). The simulation results indicated that the subresolvable region in high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment thermal ablation mainly happened at the boundary between bubbles and the untreated region and does not affect the accuracy of thermal lesion detection. The accurate detection of the thermal lesion using Nakagami imaging mainly depends on bubbles and thermal lesion characterization. Our thermal ablation experiments confirmed that Nakagami imaging has the ability to accurately identify thermal lesions from bubbles. CONCLUSION: The subresolvable effect is helpful for thermal lesion identification, and precision is related to the Nakagami values chosen for boundary division in Nakagami imaging. Therefore, Nakagami imaging is a promising method for accurately evaluating thermal lesions. Further studies in vivo and in clinical settings will be needed to explore its potential applications.",0
"PURPOSE: This paper presents a high-intensity focus ultrasound (HIFU) robotic system for treating breast fibroadenoma under the guidance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Based on the thermal and mechanical effects of ultrasound, the system aims to deliver ultrasound energy to a target precisely without damaging the normal tissue. The temperature elevation can be monitored in real time by MRI, and the treatment plan can be adjusted during the procedure. The requirements, design specifications, control system and registration of the robotic system are specified. METHODS: The robotic system was designed with a 3 degrees of freedom manipulator with limit switches and encoders, a customised MRI-compatible breast coil, a water bladder with sets of breast-conforming brackets, and a probe capable of generating ultrasound. Twenty volunteers were recruited for this study, and their data were analysed to provide more precise data for the design. The accuracy of the robot was evaluated in free space using a coordinate measuring machine, phantom and ex vivo porcine tissue in MRI room. The study also verified the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the MRI with the effect of the robotic system. RESULTS: The research findings revealed that the manipulator exhibited a translational precision of 0.10 ± 0.14 mm, a rotational fidelity around the X direction of 0.11 ± 0.09°, and an oscillatory exactness around the Y direction of 0.10 ± 0.08°. The investigation of positioning accuracy demonstrated that the robot's error in free space was 0.26 ± 0.07 mm. When subjected to MRI room with agar-silica phantom and ex vivo porcine tissue, the positioning accuracy amounted to 1.11 ± 0.47 mm and 1.57 ± 0.52 mm. In the presence of the robotic system, the SNR of the MRI experienced a 4.2% reduction, which had a negligible impact on image quality. CONCLUSIONS: The conducted experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed MRI-guided HIFU robotic system in executing agar-silica phantom and ex vivo porcine tissue investigations with adequate positioning accuracy. Consequently, this system exhibits certain feasibility for the treatment of breast fibroadenomas.",0
"BACKGROUND: Low intensity, transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a re-emerging brain stimulation technique with the unique capability of reaching deep brain structures non-invasively. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We sought to demonstrate that tFUS can selectively and accurately target and modulate deep brain structures in humans important for emotional functioning as well as learning and memory. We hypothesized that tFUS would result in significant longitudinal changes in perfusion in the targeted brain region as well as selective modulation of BOLD activity and BOLD-based functional connectivity of the target region. METHODS: In this study, we collected MRI before, simultaneously during, and after tFUS of two deep brain structures on different days in sixteen healthy adults each serving as their own control. Using longitudinal arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI and simultaneous blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI, we found changes in cerebral perfusion, regional brain activity and functional connectivity specific to the targeted regions of the amygdala and entorhinal cortex (ErC). RESULTS: tFUS selectively increased perfusion in the targeted brain region and not in the contralateral homolog or either bilateral control region. Additionally, tFUS directly affected BOLD activity in a target specific fashion without engaging auditory cortex in any analysis. Finally, tFUS resulted in selective modulation of the targeted functional network connectivity. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that tFUS can selectively modulate perfusion, neural activity and connectivity in deep brain structures and connected networks. Lack of auditory cortex findings suggests that the mechanism of tFUS action is not due to auditory or acoustic startle response but rather a direct neuromodulatory process. Our findings suggest that tFUS has the potential for future application as a novel therapy in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with subcortical pathology.",0
"Focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with intravenous microbubbles (MBs) has been shown to increase drug delivery to the spinal cord in animal models. Eventual clinical translation of such a technique in the sensitive spinal cord requires robust treatment monitoring to ensure efficacy, localization, safety, and provide key intraprocedural feedback. Here, the use of passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of MB emissions with a spine-specific detector array in the context of transvertebral FUS sonications is investigated in silico. Using computed tomography-derived human vertebral geometry, transvertebral detection of MBs is evaluated over varying source locations with and without phase and amplitude corrections (PACs). The impact of prefocal cavitation is studied by simulating concurrent cavitation events in the canal and pre-laminar region. Spatially sensitive application of phase and amplitude is used to balance signal strengths emanating from different axial depths in combination with multiple dynamic ranges to elicit multisource viewing. Collectively, the results of this study encourage the use of PAM in transvertebral FUS applications with PACs to not only localize sources originating in the spinal canal but also multiple sources of innate amplitude mismatches when corrective methods are applied.",0
"Transcranial low-intensity ultrasound is a promising neuromodulation modality, with the advantages of noninvasiveness, deep penetration, and high spatiotemporal accuracy. However, the underlying biological mechanism of ultrasonic neuromodulation remains unclear, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Here, the well-known Piezo1 was studied through a conditional knockout mouse model as a major mediator for ultrasound neuromodulation ex vivo and in vivo. We showed that Piezo1 knockout (P1KO) in the right motor cortex of mice significantly reduced ultrasound-induced neuronal calcium responses, limb movement, and muscle electromyogram (EMG) responses. We also detected higher Piezo1 expression in the central amygdala (CEA), which was found to be more sensitive to ultrasound stimulation than the cortex was. Knocking out the Piezo1 in CEA neurons showed a significant reduction of response under ultrasound stimulation, while knocking out astrocytic Piezo1 showed no-obvious changes in neuronal responses. Additionally, we excluded an auditory confound by monitoring auditory cortical activation and using smooth waveform ultrasound with randomized parameters to stimulate P1KO ipsilateral and contralateral regions of the same brain and recording evoked movement in the corresponding limb. Thus, we demonstrate that Piezo1 is functionally expressed in different brain regions and that it is an important mediator of ultrasound neuromodulation in the brain, laying the ground for further mechanistic studies of ultrasound.",0
"With an ever-growing list of neurological applications of focused ultrasound (FUS), there has been a consequent increase in the variety of systems for delivering ultrasound energy to the brain. Specifically, recent successful pilot clinical trials of blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening with FUS have generated substantial interest in the future applications of this relatively novel therapy, with divergent, purpose-built technologies emerging. With many of these technologies at various stages of pre-clinical and clinical investigation, this article seeks to provide an overview and analysis of the numerous medical devices in active use and under development for FUS-mediated BBB opening.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Sonosensitive high-boiling point perfluorocarbon F8TAC18-PFOB emulsions previously exhibited thermal enhancement during focused ultrasound heating in ex vivo pig livers, kidneys and a laminar flow phantom. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate heating under turbulent conditions, observe perfusion effects, quantify heating in terms of acoustic absorption and model the experimental data. METHODS: In this study, similar perfluorocarbon emulsions were circulated at incremental concentrations of 0.07, 0.13, 0.19 and 0.25% v:v through a percolated turbulent flow phantom, more representative of the biological tissue than a laminar flow phantom. The concentrations represent the droplet content in only the perfused fluid, rather than the droplet concentration throughout the entire cross-section. The temperature was measured with magnetic resonance thermometry, during focused ultrasound sonications of 67 W, 95% duty cycle and 33 s duration. These were used in Bioheat equation simulations to investigate in silico the thermal phenomena. The temperature change was compared with the control condition by circulating de-gassed and de-ionized water through the flow phantom without droplets. RESULTS: With these 1.24 µm diameter droplets at 0.25% v:v, the acoustic absorption coefficient increased from 0.93 ± 0.05 at 0.0% v:v to 1.82 ± 0.22 m-1 at 0.25% v:v using a 0.1 mL s-1 flow rate. Without perfusion at 0.25% v:v, an increase was observed from 1.23 ± 0.07 m-1 at 0.0% v:v to 1.65 ± 0.17 m-1. CONCLUSION: The results further support previously reported thermal enhancement with F8TAC18-PFOB emulsion, quantified the increased absorption at small concentration intervals, illustrated that the effects can be observed in a variety of visceral tissue models and provided a method to simulate untested scenarios.",0
"Focused ultrasound and microbubbles can non-invasively and locally deliver therapeutics and imaging agents across the blood-brain barrier. Uniform treatment and minimal adverse bioeffects are critical to achieve reliable doses and enable safe routine use of this technique. Towards these aims, we have previously designed a rapid short-pulse ultrasound sequence and used it to deliver a 3 kDa model agent to mouse brains. We observed a homogeneous distribution in delivery and blood-brain barrier closing within 10 min. However, many therapeutics and imaging agents are larger than 3 kDa, such as antibody fragments and antisense oligonucleotides. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of using rapid short-pulses to deliver higher-molecular-weight model agents. 3, 10 and 70 kDa dextrans were successfully delivered to mouse brains, with decreasing doses and more heterogeneous distributions with increasing agent size. Minimal extravasation of endogenous albumin (66.5 kDa) was observed, while immunoglobulin (~ 150 kDa) and PEGylated liposomes (97.9 nm) were not detected. This study indicates that rapid short-pulses are versatile and, at an acoustic pressure of 0.35 MPa, can deliver therapeutics and imaging agents of sizes up to a hydrodynamic diameter between 8 nm (70 kDa dextran) and 11 nm (immunoglobulin). Increasing the acoustic pressure can extend the use of rapid short-pulses to deliver agents beyond this threshold, with little compromise on safety. This study demonstrates the potential for deliveries of higher-molecular-weight therapeutics and imaging agents using rapid short-pulses.",0
"Focused ultrasound ablation surgery (FUAS) is a novel therapy with a wide range of potential applications. However, synergists are crucial to the therapy process due to the ultrasonic energy's attenuation properties. As a result of the complex hypoxic environment in the tumor area and many factors, the existing synergists have limitations such as weak targeting, single imaging mode, and easy tumor recurrence after treatment. Because of the above deficiencies, this study intends to construct bio-targeted oxygen production probes consisting of Bifidobacterium that naturally target the hypoxia region of the tumor and multi-functional oxygen-producing nanoparticles equipped with IR780, perfluorohexane (PFH), CBP (carboplatin), and oxygen. The probes are expected to achieve targeted and synergistic FUAS therapy and dual-mode imaging to mediate tumor diagnosis and treatment. The oxygen and drugs carried in it are accurately released after FUAS stimulation, which is expected to alleviate tumor hypoxia, avoid tumor drug resistance, improve the effect of chemotherapy, and realize FUAS combined with chemotherapy antitumor therapy. This strategy is expected to make up for the deficiencies of existing synergists, improve the effectiveness and safety of treatment, and provide the foundation for future tumor therapy progress.",0
"Microporosity in hydrogels is critical for directing tissue formation and function. We have developed a fibrin-based smart hydrogel, termed an acoustically responsive scaffold (ARS), which responds to focused ultrasound in a spatiotemporally controlled, user- defined manner. ARSs are highly flexible platforms due to the inclusion of phase-shift droplets and their tunable response to ultrasound through a mechanism termed acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV). Here, we demonstrated that ADV enabled consistent generation of micropores in ARSs, throughout the entire thickness (∼5.5 mm), utilizing perfluorooctane phase-shift droplets. Size characteristics of the generated micropores were quantified in response to critical parameters including acoustic properties, droplet size, and shear elastic modulus of fibrin using confocal microscopy. The findings showed that the length of the generated micropores correlated directly with excitation frequency, peak rarefactional pressure, pulse duration, droplet size, and indirectly with the shear elastic modulus of the fibrin matrix. The ADV-generated micropores in ARSs were further compared with cavitation-mediated micropores in fibrin gels without droplets. Additionally, the Keller-Miksis equation was used to predict an upper bound for micropore formation in ARSs at varying driving frequencies and droplet sizes. Finally, our in vivo studies showed that host cell migration following ADV-induced micropore formation was frequency-dependent, with up to 2.6 times higher cell migration at lower frequencies. Overall, these findings demonstrate a new potential application of ADV in hydrogels. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Interconnected micropores within a hydrogel can facilitate many cell-mediated processes. Most techniques for generating micropores are typically not biocompatible or do not enable controlled, in situ micropore formation. We used an ultrasound-based technique, termed acoustic droplet vaporization, to generate microporosity in smart hydrogels termed acoustically responsive scaffolds (ARSs). ARSs contain a fibrin matrix doped with a phase-shift droplet. We demonstrate that unique acoustic properties of phase-shift droplets can be tailored to yield spatiotemporally controlled, on-demand micropore formation. Additionally, the size characteristics of the ultrasound-generated micropores can be modulated by tuning ultrasound parameters, droplet properties, and bulk elastic properties of fibrin. Finally, we demonstrate significant, frequency-dependent host cell migration in subcutaneously implanted ARSs in mice following ultrasound-induced micropore formation in situ.",0
"Peripheral focused ultrasound stimulation (pFUS) has gained increasing attention in the past few decades, because it can be delivered to peripheral nerves, neural endings, or sub-organs. With different stimulation parameters, ultrasound stimulation could induce different modulation effects. Depending on the transmission medium, pFUS can be classified as body-coupled US stimulation, commonly used for therapeutics or neuromodulation, or as an air-coupled contactless US haptic system, which provides sensory inputs and allows distinct human-computer interaction paradigms. Despite growing interest in pFUS, the underlying working mechanisms remain only partially understood, and many applications are still in their infancy. This review focused on existing applications, working mechanisms, the latest progress, and future directions of pFUS. In terms of therapeutics, large-sample randomized clinical trials in humans are needed to translate these state of art techniques into treatments for specific diseases. The airborne US for human-computer interaction is still in its preliminary stage, but further efforts in task-oriented US applications might provide a promising interaction tool soon.",0
"The glymphatic system is a perivascular fluid transport system for waste clearance. Glymphatic transport is believed to be driven by the perivascular pumping effect created by the pulsation of the arterial wall caused by the cardiac cycle. Ultrasound sonication of circulating microbubbles (MBs) in the cerebral vasculature induces volumetric expansion and contraction of MBs that push and pull on the vessel wall to generate a MB pumping effect. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether glymphatic transport can be mechanically manipulated by focused ultrasound (FUS) sonication of MBs. The glymphatic pathway in intact mouse brains was studied using intranasal administration of fluorescently labeled albumin as fluid tracers, followed by FUS sonication at a deep brain target (thalamus) in the presence of intravenously injected MBs. Intracisternal magna injection, the conventional technique used in studying glymphatic transport, was employed to provide a comparative reference. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy imaging of optically cleared brain tissue revealed that FUS sonication enhanced the transport of fluorescently labeled albumin tracer in the perivascular space (PVS) along microvessels, primarily the arterioles. We also obtained evidence of FUS-enhanced penetration of the albumin tracer from the PVS into the interstitial space. This study revealed that ultrasound combined with circulating MBs could mechanically enhance glymphatic transport in the brain.",0
"BACKGROUND: Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a medical technology that non-invasively stimulates the brain and has been applied in thermal ablation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, and neuromodulation. In recent years, numerous experiences and indications for the use of FUS in clinical and preclinical studies have rapidly expanded. Focused ultrasound-mediated BBB opening induces cognitive enhancement and neurogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. METHODS: Here, we investigate the effects of FUS-mediated BBB opening on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive function in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We applied FUS with microbubble to the hippocampus and LTP was measured 6 weeks after BBB opening using FUS. Field recordings were made with a concentric bipolar electrode positioned in the CA1 region using an extracellular glass pipette filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Morris water maze and Y-maze was performed to test cognitive function. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that FUS-mediated BBB opening has a significant impact on increasing LTP at Schaffer collateral - CA1 synapses and rescues cognitive dysfunction and working memory. These effects persisted for up to 7 weeks post-treatment. Also, FUS-mediated BBB opening in the hippocampus increased PKA phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Therefore, it could be a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases as it remarkably increases LTP, thereby improving working memory.",0
"BACKGROUND: Mechanical waves produced by ultrasound pulses have been shown to activate mechanosensitive ion channels and modulate peripheral nerves. However, while peripheral ultrasound neuromodulation has been demonstrated in vitro and in pre-clinical models, there have been few reports of clinical tests. AIM: We modified a diagnostic imaging system for ultrasound neuromodulation in human subjects. We report the first safety and feasibility outcomes in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and discuss these outcomes in relation to previous pre-clinical results. DESIGN: The study was performed as an open label feasibility study to assess the effects of hepatic ultrasound (targeted to the porta hepatis) on glucometabolic parameters in subjects with T2D. Stimulation (pFUS Treatment) was performed for 3 days (i.e., 15-minutes per day), was preceded by a baseline examination, and followed by a two-week observation period. METHODS: Multiple metabolic assays were employed including measures of fasting glucose and insulin, insulin resistance, and glucose metabolism. The safety and tolerability were also assessed by monitoring adverse events, changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters, and clinical laboratory measures. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We report post-pFUS trends in several outcomes that were consistent with previous pre-clinical findings. Fasting insulin was lowered, resulting in a reduction of HOMA-IR scores (p-value 0.01; corrected Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test). Additional safety and exploratory markers demonstrated no device-related adverse impact of pFUS. Our findings demonstrate that pFUS represents a promising new treatment modality that could be used as a non-pharmaceutical adjunct or even alternative to current drug treatments in diabetes.",0
"PURPOSE: To analyze the predictive value of clinical and ultrasound parameters for treatment failure after administration of methotrexate (MTX) in combination with suction curettage (SC) in treatment of cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) in the early first trimester. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, electronic medical records of patients diagnosed with CSP and initially treated between 2015 and 2022 with MTX combined with SC were reviewed and outcome data were collected. RESULTS: 127 patients met inclusion criteria. 25 (19.69%) required additional treatment. Logistic regression analysis indicated that factors independently associated with the need for additional treatment included progesterone level > 25 mIU/mL (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 0.98-2.87, P = 0.039), abundant blood flow (OR: 5.19; 95% CI: 2.44-16.31, P = 0.011), gestational sac size > 3 cm (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.12-6.87, P = 0.029), and the myometrial thickness between the bladder and gestational sac < 2.5 mm (OR: 3.48; 95% CI: 1.91-6.98, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified several factors which increase the need for additional treatment following the initial treatment of CSP with MTX and SC. Alternative therapy should be considered if these factors are present.",0
"Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) lesioning of the ventralis intermedius nucleus (VIM) has shown promise in treating drug-refractory essential tremor (ET). It remains unknown whether focal VIM lesions by MRgFUS have broader restorative effects on information flow within the whole-brain network of ET patients. We applied an information-theoretical approach based on intrinsic ignition and the concept of transfer entropy (TE) to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics after VIM-MRgFUS. Eighteen ET patients (mean age 71.44 years) underwent repeated 3T resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) assessments one day before (T0) and one month (T1) and six months (T2) post-MRgFUS, respectively. We observed increased whole brain ignition-driven mean integration (IDMI) at T1 (p < 0.05), along with trend increases at T2. Further, constraining to motor network nodes, we identified significant increases in information-broadcasting (bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) and left cerebellar lobule III) and information-receiving (right precentral gyrus) at T1. Remarkably, increased information-broadcasting in bilateral SMA was correlated with relative improvement of the CRST in the treated hand. In addition, causal TE-based effective connectivity (EC) at T1 showed an increase from right SMA to left cerebellar lobule crus II and from left cerebellar lobule III to right thalamus. In conclusion, results suggest a change in information transmission capacity in ET after MRgFUS and a shift towards a more integrated functional state with increased levels of global and directional information flow.",0
"BACKGROUND: Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound with concomitant administration of intravenous microbubbles (LIPU-MB) can be used to open the blood-brain barrier. We aimed to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of LIPU-MB to enhance the delivery of albumin-bound paclitaxel to the peritumoural brain of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. METHODS: We conducted a dose-escalation phase 1 clinical trial in adults (aged ≥18 years) with recurrent glioblastoma, a tumour diameter of 70 mm or smaller, and a Karnofsky performance status of at least 70. A nine-emitter ultrasound device was implanted into a skull window after tumour resection. LIPU-MB with intravenous albumin-bound paclitaxel infusion was done every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. Six dose levels of albumin-bound paclitaxel (40 mg/m2, 80 mg/m2, 135 mg/m2, 175 mg/m2, 215 mg/m2, and 260 mg/m2) were evaluated. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity occurring during the first cycle of sonication and albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy. Safety was assessed in all treated patients. Analyses were done in the per-protocol population. Blood-brain barrier opening was investigated by MRI before and after sonication. We also did pharmacokinetic analyses of LIPU-MB in a subgroup of patients from the current study and a subgroup of patients who received carboplatin as part of a similar trial (NCT03744026). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04528680, and a phase 2 trial is currently open for accrual. FINDINGS: 17 patients (nine men and eight women) were enrolled between Oct 29, 2020, and Feb 21, 2022. As of data cutoff on Sept 6, 2022, median follow-up was 11·89 months (IQR 11·12-12·78). One patient was treated per dose level of albumin-bound paclitaxel for levels 1 to 5 (40-215 mg/m2), and 12 patients were treated at dose level 6 (260 mg/m2). A total of 68 cycles of LIPU-MB-based blood-brain barrier opening were done (median 3 cycles per patient [range 2-6]). At a dose of 260 mg/m2, encephalopathy (grade 3) occurred in one (8%) of 12 patients during the first cycle (considered a dose-limiting toxicity), and in one other patient during the second cycle (grade 2). In both cases, the toxicity resolved and treatment continued at a lower dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel, with a dose of 175 mg/m2 in the case of the grade 3 encephalopathy, and to 215 mg/m2 in the case of the grade 2 encephalopathy. Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy was observed in one patient during the third cycle of 260 mg/m2 albumin-bound paclitaxel. No progressive neurological deficits attributed to LIPU-MB were observed. LIPU-MB-based blood-brain barrier opening was most commonly associated with immediate yet transient grade 1-2 headache (12 [71%] of 17 patients). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (eight [47%]), leukopenia (five [29%]), and hypertension (five [29%]). No treatment-related deaths occurred during the study. Imaging analysis showed blood-brain barrier opening in the brain regions targeted by LIPU-MB, which diminished over the first 1 h after sonication. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed that LIPU-MB led to increases in the mean brain parenchymal concentrations of albumin-bound paclitaxel (from 0·037 μM [95% CI 0·022-0·063] in non-sonicated brain to 0·139 μM [0·083-0·232] in sonicated brain [3·7-times increase], p<0·0001) and carboplatin (from 0·991 μM [0·562-1·747] in non-sonicated brain to 5·878 μM [3·462-9·980] μM in sonicated brain [5·9-times increase], p=0·0001). INTERPRETATION: LIPU-MB using a skull-implantable ultrasound device transiently opens the blood-brain barrier allowing for safe, repeated penetration of cytotoxic drugs into the brain. This study has prompted a subsequent phase 2 study combining LIPU-MB with albumin-bound paclitaxel plus carboplatin (NCT04528680), which is ongoing.

"Glioblastoma (GB) is one of the most aggressive and difficult-to-treat brain tumors, with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. In recent years, sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and magnetic resonance focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) have emerged as promising approaches for the treatment of GB. SDT uses ultrasound waves in combination with a sonosensitizer to selectively damage cancer cells, while MRgFUS delivers high-intensity ultrasound waves to precisely target tumor tissue and disrupt the blood-brain barrier to enhance drug delivery. In this review, we explore the potential of SDT as a novel therapeutic strategy for GB. We discuss the principles of SDT, its mechanisms of action, and the preclinical and clinical studies that have investigated its use in Gliomas. We also highlight the challenges, the limitations, and the future perspectives of SDT. Overall, SDT and MRgFUS hold promise as novel and potentially complementary treatment modalities for GB. Further research is needed to optimize their parameters and determine their safety and efficacy in humans, but their potential for selective and targeted tumor destruction makes them an exciting area of investigation in the field of brain cancer therapy.",0
"Focused ultrasound is a novel technique for the treatment of aggressive brain tumors that uses both mechanical and thermal mechanisms. This non-invasive technique can allow for both the thermal ablation of inoperable tumors and the delivery of chemotherapy and immunotherapy while minimizing the risk of infection and shortening the time to recovery. With recent advances, focused ultrasound has been increasingly effective for larger tumors without the need for a craniotomy and can be used with minimal surrounding soft tissue damage. Treatment efficacy is dependent on multiple variables, including blood-brain barrier permeability, patient anatomical features, and tumor-specific features. Currently, many clinical trials are currently underway for the treatment of non-neoplastic cranial pathologies and other non-cranial malignancies. In this article, we review the current state of surgical management of brain tumors using focused ultrasound.",0
"Whilst sonothrombolysis is a promising and noninvasive ultrasound technique for treating blood clots, bleeding caused by thrombolytic agents used for dissolving clots and potential obstruction of blood flow by detached clots (i.e., embolus) are the major limitations of the current approach. In the present study, a new sonothrombolysis method is proposed for treating embolus without the use of thrombolytic drugs. Our proposed method involves (a) generating a spatially localised acoustic radiation force in a blood vessel against the blood flow to trap moving blood clots (i.e., generation of an acoustic net), (b) producing acoustic cavitation to mechanically destroy the trapped embolus, and (c) acoustically monitoring the trapping and mechanical fractionation processes. Three different ultrasound transducers with different purposes were employed in the proposed method: (1) 1-MHz dual focused ultrasound (dFUS) transducers for capturing moving blood clots, (2) a 2-MHz High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) source for fractionating blood clots and (3) a passive acoustic emission detector with broad bandwidth (10 kHz to 20 MHz) for receiving and analysing acoustic waves scattered from a trapped embolus and acoustic cavitation. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, in vitro experiments with an optically transparent blood vessel-mimicking phantom filled with a blood mimicking fluid and a blood clot (1.2 to 5 mm in diameter) were performed with varying the dFUS and HIFU exposure conditions under various flow conditions (from 1.77 to 6.19 cm/s). A high-speed camera was used to observe the production of acoustic fields, acoustic cavitation formation and blood clot fragmentation within a blood vessel by the proposed method. Numerical simulations of acoustic and temperature fields generated under a given exposure condition were also conducted to further interpret experimental results on the proposed sonothrombolysis. Our results clearly showed that fringe pattern-like acoustic pressure fields (fringe width of 1 mm) produced in a blood vessel by the dFUS captured an embolus (1.2 to 5 mm in diameter) at the flow velocity up to 6.19 cm/s. This was likely to be due to the greater magnitude of the dFUS-induced acoustic radiation force exerted on an embolus in the opposite direction to the flow in a blood vessel than that of the drag force produced by the flow. The acoustically trapped embolus was then mechanically destructed into small pieces of debris (18 to 60 μm sized residual fragments) by the HIFU-induced strong cavitation without damaging the blood vessel walls. We also observed that acoustic emissions emitted from a blood clot captured by the dFUS and cavitation produced by the HIFU were clearly distinguished in the frequency domain. Taken together, these results can suggest that our proposed sonothrombolysis method could be used as a promising tool for treating thrombosis and embolism through capturing and destroying blood clots effectively.",0
"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the sustainable antihypertensive effects and protection against target organ damage caused by low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) stimulation and the underlying mechanism in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) model. METHODS AND RESULTS: SHRs were treated with ultrasound stimulation of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (VlPAG) for 20 min every day for 2 months. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was compared among normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats, SHR control group, SHR Sham group, and SHR LIFU stimulation group. Cardiac ultrasound imaging and hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining of the heart and kidney were performed to assess target organ damage. The c-fos immunofluorescence analysis and plasma levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone, hydrocortisone, and endothelin-1 were measured to investigate the neurohumoral and organ systems involved. We found that SBP was reduced from 172 ± 4.2 mmHg to 141 ± 2.1 mmHg after 1 month of LIFU stimulation, P  < 0.01. The next month of treatment can maintain the rat's blood pressure at 146 ± 4.2 mmHg at the end of the experiment. LIFU stimulation reverses left ventricular hypertrophy and improves heart and kidney function. Furthermore, LIFU stimulation enhanced the neural activity from the VLPAG to the caudal ventrolateral medulla and reduced the plasma levels of ANGII and Aldo. CONCLUSION: We concluded that LIFU stimulation has a sustainable antihypertensive effect and protects against target organ damage by activating antihypertensive neural pathways from VLPAG to the caudal ventrolateral medulla and further inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity, thereby supporting a novel and noninvasive alternative therapy to treat hypertension.",0
"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is regarded as one of the most lethal types of tumor in the world, and optional way to treat the tumor are urgently needed. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a key role in the occurrence and development of pancreatic tumors. CD133 is a specific antigen for targeting the pancreatic CSCs subpopulation. Previous studies have shown that CSC-targeted therapy is effective in inhibiting tumorigenesis and transmission. However, CD133 targeted therapy combined with HIFU for pancreatic cancer is absent. PURPOSE: To improve therapeutic efficiency and minimize side effects, we carry a potent combination of CSCs antibody with synergist by an effective and visualized delivery nanocarrier to pancreatic cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multifunctional CD133-targeted nanovesicles (CD133-grafted Cy5.5/PFOB@P-HVs) with encapsulated perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) in a 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) shell modified with poly ethylene glycol (PEG) and superficially modified with CD133 and Cy 5.5 were constructed following the prescribed order. The nanovesicles were characterized for the biological and chemical characteristics feature. We explored the specific targeting capacity in vitro and the therapeutic effect in vivo. RESULTS: The in vitro targeting experiment and in vivo FL and ultrasonic experiments showed the aggregation of CD133-grafted Cy5.5/PFOB@P-HVs around CSCs. In vivo FL imaging experiments demonstrated that the nanovesicles assemble for the highest concentration in the tumor at 24 h after administration. Under HIFU irradiation, the synergistic efficacy of the combination of the CD133-targeting carrier and HIFU for tumor treatment was obvious. CONCLUSION: CD133-grafted Cy5.5/PFOB@P-HVs combined with HIFU irradiation could enhance the tumor treatment effect not only by improving the delivery of nanovesicles but also by enhancing the HIFU thermal and mechanical effects in the tumor microenvironment, which is a highly effective targeted therapy for treating pancreatic cancer.",0
"The therapeutic potential of many gene therapies is limited by their inability to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). While intranasal administration of plasmid DNA nanoparticles (NPs) offers a non-invasive approach to bypass the BBB, it is not targeted to disease-relevant brain regions. Here, our goal was to determine whether focused ultrasound (FUS) can enrich intranasal delivery of our plasmid DNA NPs to target deeper brain regions, in this case the regions most affected in Parkinson's disease. Combining FUS with intranasal administration resulted in enhanced delivery of DNA NPs to the rodent brain, by recruitment and transfection of microglia. FUS increased transgene expression by over 3-fold after intranasal administration compared to intravenous administration. Additionally, FUS with intranasal delivery increased transgene expression in the sonicated hemisphere by over 80%, altered cellular transfection patterns at the sonication sites, and improved penetration of plasmid NPs into the brain parenchyma (with a 1-fold and 3-fold increase in proximity of transgene expression to neurons in the forebrain and midbrain respectively, and a 40% increase in proximity of transgene expression to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra). These results provide evidence in support of using FUS to improve transgene expression after intranasal delivery of non-viral gene therapies.",0
"BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has emerged as a precise, incisionless approach to cerebral lesioning and an alternative to neuromodulation in movement disorders. Despite rigorous clinical trials, long-term patient-centered outcome data after MRgFUS for tremor-predominant Parkinson's Disease (TPPD) are relatively lacking. OBJECTIVE: To report long-term data on patient satisfaction and quality of life after MRgFUS thalamotomy for TPPD. METHODS: In a retrospective study of patients who underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy for TPPD at our institution between 2015 and 2022, a patient survey was administered to collect self-reported measures of tremor improvement, recurrence, Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and side effects. Patient demographics, FUS parameters, and lesion characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were included with a median follow-up of 16 months. Immediate tremor improvement was achieved in 96% of patients. Sustained improvement was achieved in 63% of patients at last follow-up. Complete tremor recurrence to baseline occurred for 17% of patients. Life quality improvement denoted by a PGIC of 1 to 2 was reported by 69% of patients. Long-term side effects were reported by 38% of patients and were mostly mild. Performing a secondary anteromedial lesion to target the ventralis oralis anterior/posterior nucleus was associated with higher rates of speech-related side effects (56% vs 12%), without significant improvement in tremor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Patient satisfaction with FUS thalamotomy for tremor-predominant PD was very high, even at longer term. Extended lesioning to target the motor thalamus did not improve tremor control and may contribute to greater frequency of postoperative motor- and speech-related side effects.",0
"Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a new surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous experience with radiofrequency lesionectomy and deep brain stimulation (DBS) has identified several candidate targets for MRgFUS intended to alleviate the motor symptoms of PD. The main advantage of MRgFUS is that it is incisionless. MRgFUS has certain limitations and is associated with adverse effects. The present study reviews the literature on conventional surgical interventions for PD, discusses recent studies on MRgFUS, and the comparison between DBS and MRgFUS for PD. The reviews aims to provide an essential reference for neurologists to select the appropriate treatments for patients with PD.",0
"BACKGROUND: Locally recurrent prostate cancer following primary external beam radiotherapy without distant metastasis is a challenging problem, with no current consensus on the optimal management of these patients. Traditional whole-gland salvage treatments offered up to a 50% 5-year disease-free survival rate but with troubling levels of risk for significant complications. Recent progress in advanced imaging techniques has allowed a more accurate selection of patients with local-only recurrence and a selection of patients that may be suitable for newer partial-gland salvage treatments that may reduce late complications. METHODS: This article reviews advances in patient selection and provides an overview of whole- and partial-gland salvage results from selected recent meta-analyses, multi-institutional series, and studies from centers of excellence for these treatment approaches. RESULTS: Salvage radical prostatectomy produces 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates in the 50%-60% range with severe gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in < 2% but severe genitourinary (GU) toxicity in 15%-23% of patients. The whole-gland options of high and low dose rate brachytherapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy appear to offer similar 5-year control rates, with low severe GU and GI toxicity rates of 4%-8% and <2%, respectively. Cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) offer similar 5-year RFS rates but carry significant risks for severe GU and GI toxicity in the range of 10%-27% and <2%, respectively. Early results of partial-gland salvage techniques in selected patients appear promising, with 3-year RFS rates of 48%-72% and rare grade 3 toxicity. CONCLUSION: It is important to understand the relative effectiveness and risks of the various treatment options to effectively counsel patients who face this distressing clinical situation. Whole-gland salvage options offer the possibility of long-term control but with significant risks of severe toxicity. Emerging data for the partial-gland salvage options in appropriately selected patients may offer hope of reasonable control rates with reduced severe toxicity.",0
"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the in vivo combined effects of pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) and radiation (RT) for prostate cancer treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An animal prostate tumor model was developed by implanting human LNCaP tumor cells in the prostates of nude mice. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with pFUS, RT or both (pFUS + RT) and compared with a control group. Non-thermal pFUS treatment was delivered by keeping the body temperature below 42 °C as measured real-time by MR thermometry and using a pFUS protocol (1 MHz, 25 W focused ultrasound; 1 Hz pulse rate with a 10% duty cycle for 60 sec for each sonication). Each tumor was covered entirely using 4-8 sonication spots. RT treatment with a dose of 2 Gy was delivered using an external beam (6 MV photon energy with dose rate 300MU/min). Following the treatment, mice were scanned weekly with MRI for tumor volume measurement. RESULTS: The results showed that the tumor volume in the control group increased exponentially to 142 ± 6%, 205 ± 12%, 286 ± 22% and 410 ± 33% at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after treatment, respectively. In contrast, the pFUS group was 29% (p < 0.05), 24% (p < 0.05), 8% and 9% smaller, the RT group was 7%, 10%, 12% and 18% smaller, and the pFUS + RT group was 32%, 39%, 41% and 44% (all with p < 0.05) smaller than the control group at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks post treatment, respectively. Tumors treated by pFUS showed an early response (i.e. the first 2 weeks), while the RT group showed a late response. The combined pFUS + RT treatment showed consistent response throughout the post-treatment weeks. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that RT combined with non-thermal pFUS can significantly delay the tumor growth. The mechanism of tumor cell killing between pFUS and RT may be different. Pulsed FUS shows early tumor growth delay, while RT contributes to the late effect on tumor growth delay. The addition of pFUS to RT significantly enhanced the therapeutic effect for prostate cancer treatment.",0
"Focused ultrasound technologies are of growing interest for noninvasive ablation of localized prostate cancer (PCa). Here we present the results of the first case study evaluating the feasibility of non-thermal mechanical ablation of human prostate adenocarcinoma tissue using the boiling histotripsy (BH) method on ex vivo tissue. High intensity focused ultrasound field was generated using a 1.5-MHz custom-made transducer with nominal F#=0.75. A sonication protocol of 734 W acoustic power, 10-ms long BH-pulses, 30 pulses per focal spot, 1 % duty cycle, and 1 mm distance between single foci was tested in an ex vivo human prostate tissue sample containing PCa. The protocol used here has been successfully applied in the previous BH studies for mechanical disintegration of ex vivo prostatic human tissue with benign hyperplasia. BH treatment was monitored using B-mode ultrasound. Post-treatment histologic analysis demonstrated BH produced liquefaction of the targeted tissue volume. BH treated benign prostate parenchyma and PCa had similar tissue fractionation into subcellular fragments. The results of the study demonstrated that PCa tumor tissue can be mechanically ablated using the BH method. Further studies will aim on optimizing protocol parameters to accelerate treatment while maintaining complete destruction of the targeted tissue volume into subcellular debris.",0
"At present there is no standardised system for scoring the appearance of the prostate on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after focal ablation for localised prostate cancer. We propose a novel scoring system, the Prostate Imaging after Focal Ablation (PI-FAB) score, to fill this gap. PI-FAB involves a 3-point scale for rating MRI sequences in sequential order: (1) dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; (2) diffusion-weighted imaging, split into assessment of the high-b-value sequence first and then the apparent diffusion coefficient map; and (3) T2-weighted imaging. It is essential that the pretreatment scan is also available to help with this assessment. We designed PI-FAB using our experience of reading postablation scans over the past 15 years and include details for four representative patients initially treated with high-intensity focus ultrasound at our institution to demonstrate the scoring system. We propose PI-FAB as a standardised method for evaluating prostate MRI scans after treatment with focal ablation. The next step is to evaluate its performance across multiple experienced readers of MRI after focal therapy in a clinical data set. PATIENT SUMMARY: We propose a scoring system called PI-FAB for assessing the appearance of magnetic resonance imaging scans of the prostate after focal treatment for localised prostate cancer. This will help clinicians in deciding on further follow-up.",0
"Radical treatments and active surveillance are valid therapeutic approaches for low-risk prostate cancer. The oncologic effectiveness and morbidity of Radical Prostatectomy (RP) and radiotherapy have been broadly validated. Focal therapies pursue to reduce the morbidity observed after radical treatments, while preserving the oncologic effectiveness. This study aims to review the state-of-the-art about principles, oncologic effectiveness, morbidity, and side-effects associated with leading focal therapies. We review and summarize articles related with Cryotherapy, High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound (HIFU), Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), and Irreversible Electroporating (IRE) published in MEDLINE from 2000 to 2022. There is a wide heterogeneity in terms of the measurement of effectiveness and morbidity. Hence, comparing different energies, strategies and protocols seem to be unprecise and controversial. Cryosurgery and HIFU have reported more clinical experience than PDT and IRE. Biochemical recurrence rate after the first session varied from 4.5% to 23%, and up to 20% of patients underwent a salvage radical treatment. The reported incidence of erectile disfunction and urinary incontinence ranges from 3% to 50% and 0% to 34%, respectively. None randomized clinical trial comparing any focal therapy to any radical treatment has been published. We conclude that the expansion of focal therapies requires the consolidation of MRI-guided fusion biopsies in everyday clinical practice. Short-term oncologic effectiveness has been proved and supports their usefulness in low-risk patients unfit for surgical treatment. However, long-term effects and the clinical experience in intermediate and high-risk patients remains limited. Currently none of the focal therapies can be considered the Gold Standard for low-risk patients.",0
"OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy with coblation for the treatment of inferior turbinate hypertrophy (ITH). METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 20 patients underwent inferior turbinate surgery, which consisted of either HIFU or coblation therapy. Efficacy, safety, and tolerability were evaluated by subjective symptom scores, acoustic rhinometry, and nasal endoscopy. RESULTS: The modified nasal obstruction symptom evaluation (NOSE) score and nasal obstruction visual analog scale (NO-VAS) significantly decreased in both groups 12 weeks postoperatively. The between-group differences in the evaluation scores were not statistically significant. On nasal endoscopy, the HIFU patients showed improvements in mucosal swelling sooner than the patients undergoing coblation therapy. Nasal crusting significantly increased in the patients undergoing coblation compared to the patients undergoing HIFU therapy until postoperative week 4. Mucosal preservation was superior in the HIFU patients. Although HIFU was less painful than coblation therapy during the procedure, the difference was not significant (4.9 vs. 6.3, P=0.143). The difference in global satisfaction between the two groups was not statistically significant, although satisfaction was slightly higher among the HIFU patients than among the coblation patients (4.6 vs. 4.1, P=0.393). CONCLUSION: HIFU provided results similar to those of coblation therapy for patients with nasal obstruction due to ITH, but HIFU therapy caused less discomfort during the procedure. HIFU therapy appears to be a good noninvasive alternative to the current surgical modalities for ITH.",0
"BACKGROUND: Herein, a robotic system offering Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) therapy of thyroid nodules was developed. METHODS: The robotic system offers linear motion in 2 PC-controlled axes that navigate a 3 MHz single-element focused transducer. The system, through a C-arm structure attaches to the table of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners and couples to the neck of patients lying in the supine position. The MRI compatibility of the developed system was assessed inside a 3 T scanner. Benchtop and MRI feasibility studies evaluating the heating performance of the system were executed on excised pork tissue and on homogeneous and thyroid model agar-based phantoms. RESULTS: The MRI compatibility of the system was successfully established. Grid sonications executed using robotic motion inflicted discrete and overlapping lesions on the excised tissue, while magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry successfully monitored thermal heating in agar-based phantoms. CONCLUSIONS: The developed system was found to be efficient with ex-vivo evaluation. The system can perform clinical MRgFUS therapy of thyroid nodules and other shallow targets after further in-vivo evaluation.",0
"BACKGROUND: Image-guided thermal ablation interventions are novel thermal-based modalities used for the treatment of benign thyroid nodules. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and a Bayesian network meta-analysis, examining studies using thermal ablation interventions in the treatment of benign nodular thyroid disease (PROSPERO CRD42022367680). The primary endpoints included volume reduction rate (VRR), symptomatic score and cosmetic score improvement. Secondary endpoints included vocal disturbances, laryngeal nerve palsy, hypothyroidism and nodular regrowth (defined by increased nodular volume of > 50 % for thermal ablation or new nodules arising in remaining thyroid tissue CS). RESULTS: We included 16 studies (3 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 13 comparative case series), describing radiofrequency ablation (RFA), laser ablation (LA), microwave ablation (MWA) high-intensity focus ultrasound (HIFU) and conventional surgery (CS), respectively. The review included data from 4112 patients followed for a mean of 11.9 months. Meta-analyses showed no significant differences among RFA, LA, MWA, HIFU and CS regarding any of the primary endpoints of VRR, symptomatic score, and cosmetic score. In examining the surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) ranking, CS (SUCRA,98.49), LA (SUCRA,51.58) and MWA (SUCRA,57.0), were identified as the three interventions that were most likely to result in the largest VRR, symptomatic and cosmetic score reduction. RFA, relative risk (RR) 0.19 (95% CI:0.06-0.48), LA RR 0.23 (95% CI:0.06-0.79), and MWA RR 0.25 (95% CI:0.09-0.60) were associated with the greatest reduction in risk for post-intervention vocal complications compared to CS, with RFA (SUCRA, 61.62) being ranked as the highest in safety. RFA RR 0.05 (95% CI:0.00-0.40) and MWA RR 0.16 (95% CI:0.02-0.73) were associated with a reduced risk of transient laryngeal nerve injury compared to CS. RFA RR 0.00 (95% CI:0.00-0.00) and MWA RR 0.00 (95% CI:0.00-0.03) were associated with a reduced risk of hypothyroidism occurrence compared to CS, with RFA (SUCRA,99.86) yielding the highest safety ranking. RFA was associated with a reduced risk for nodular regrowth RR 0.09 (95% CI: 0.00-0.85), as compared to CS. CONCLUSION: We have comprehensively reviewed the published literature on the efficacy and safety of thermal ablation modalities for benign thyroid nodules. Important research gaps remain regarding a paucity of both long-term data and high quality RCTs.",0
"Improvement in symptom severity and quality of life (QoL) are critical concerns for women with fibroids as they evaluate treatment options. This systematic review analyzed available evidence regarding minimally invasive approaches to fibroid treatment and compared validated QoL and fibroid-associated symptom scores before and after treatment. A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus from January 1990 to July 2020. English-language publications were included if they evaluated associations between minimally invasive approaches to fibroid treatment and QoL or fibroid-associated symptoms, and they used validated questionnaires before and after treatment. QoL or fibroid-associated symptom scores were compared and summarized for each minimally invasive approach. Thirty-seven studies were ultimately included in this review: 26 evaluating individual approaches and 11 which were comparative studies of minimally invasive approaches and surgical interventions. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy (USGS) significantly improved overall QoL. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) and ultrasound-guided high-intensity frequency ultrasound (US-HIFU) improved overall QoL to a similar extent as surgical interventions. Twenty-eight studies assessed fibroid-associated symptoms with the Uterine Fibroid Symptoms Quality of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QoL). UAE, magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity frequency ultrasound (MR-HIFU), US-HIFU, RFA, and percutaneous microwave ablation (PMWA) significantly decreased Symptom Severity Score by a range of 21 to 39 points (out of 100) at 6 months. Minimally invasive approaches to treat fibroids were effective alternatives to surgical interventions for improving quality of life, fibroid-associated symptoms, and pain. Outcomes among minimally invasive approaches were similar, presenting patients with numerous options for fibroid treatment.",0
"OBJECTIVES: No method is available to determine the non-perfused volume (NPV) repeatedly during magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) ablations of uterine fibroids, as repeated acquisition of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1w) scans is inhibited by safety concerns. The objective of this study was to develop and test a deep learning-based method for translation of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) into synthetic CE-T1w scans, for monitoring MR-HIFU treatment progression. METHODS: The algorithm was retrospectively trained and validated on data from 33 and 20 patients respectively who underwent an MR-HIFU treatment of uterine fibroids between June 2017 and January 2019. Postablation synthetic CE-T1w images were generated by a deep learning network trained on paired DWI and reference CE-T1w scans acquired during the treatment procedure. Quantitative analysis included calculation of the Dice coefficient of NPVs delineated on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans. Four MR-HIFU radiologists assessed the outcome of MR-HIFU treatments and NPV ratio based on the synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans. RESULTS: Dice coefficient of NPVs was 71% (± 22%). The mean difference in NPV ratio was 1.4% (± 22%) and not statistically significant (p = 0.79). Absolute agreement of the radiologists on technical treatment success on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans was 83%. NPV ratio estimations on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans were not significantly different (p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning-based synthetic CE-T1w scans derived from intraprocedural DWI allow gadolinium-free visualization of the predicted NPV, and can potentially be used for repeated gadolinium-free monitoring of treatment progression during MR-HIFU therapy for uterine fibroids. KEY POINTS: • Synthetic CE-T1w scans can be derived from diffusion-weighted imaging using deep learning. • Synthetic CE-T1w scans may be used for visualization of the NPV without using a contrast agent directly after MR-HIFU ablations of uterine fibroids.",0
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Uterine fibroids is a common problem in reproductive-age individuals, frequently causing abnormal uterine bleeding, bulk symptoms, and adverse reproductive outcomes. Traditionally, almost half of the women with symptomatic fibroids received surgery for definitive treatment. There are a growing number of nonsurgical options for treatment that have become available for patients who desire conservative treatment or those with contraindications to surgery. RECENT FINDINGS: The introduction of oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists in combination with low-dose physiologic hormonal therapy demonstrated improvement in heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, and quality of life with preservation of bone density and a modest reduction in uterine volume with few hypogonadal side effects. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery and uterine artery embolization continue to be minimally invasive procedural alternatives to hysterectomy that are safe and effective. SUMMARY: As more options for conservative management of uterine fibroids became available, it is important to counsel patients on possible options based on the size, location, and number of the fibroids as well as severity of the symptoms, plans for pregnancy, how close they are to menopause and their treatment goals.",0
"BACKGROUND: Maintaining ureteral patency is imperative to preventing renal injury and systemic infection. Ureteral stents are small conduits connecting the kidney and the bladder. They have been widely used to treat ureteral obstructions and ureteral leaks. The most problematic and frequent stent-associated complication is stent encrustation. This occurs when mineral crystals (e.g. calcium, oxalate, phosphorus, struvite) are deposited onto the surface and internal lumen of the stent. Encrustation can lead to the obstruction of a stent and increases risk of systemic infection. As a result, ureteral stents need to be replaced typically every 2-3 months. PURPOSE: In this study, we present a non-invasive, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)-based technique to recanalize obstructed stents. By taking advantage of the mechanical force produced by a HIFU beam, including acoustic radiation force, acoustic streaming, and cavitation, HIFU can break up encrustations, clearing the stent of obstruction. METHODS: The ureteral stents for this study were obtained from patients undergoing ureteral stent removal. Under the guidance of ultrasound imaging, the encrustation in the stents were located, and then targeted by HIFU at frequencies of 0.25 and 1 MHz. The duty cycle of HIFU was 10%, and the HIFU burst repetition rate was 1 Hz, while the HIFU amplitude was varied to find the threshold pressure that would displace encrustations. The treatment duration was limited at 2 min (or 120 shots from HIFU). The treatments were carried out in two different orientations (parallel and perpendicular) of the ureteral stent with respect to the HIFU beam. For each setting, five treatments were conducted for a maximum duration of 2 min. During the entire treatment, an ultrasound imaging system was used to monitor the movement of encrustations inside the stent. The peak negative HIFU pressures needed to move the encrustations inside the stent was recorded for quantitative analysis. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that at both 0.25 and 1 MHz ultrasound frequencies, obstructed stents could be recanalized. At 0.25 MHz, the needed average peak negative pressure was 0.52 MPa in parallel orientation and 0.42 MPa in perpendicular orientation. At 1 MHz, the needed average peak negative pressure was 1.10 MPa in parallel orientation and 1.15 MPa in perpendicular orientation CONCLUSIONS: This first in-vitro study has demonstrated the feasibility of non-invasive HIFU to recanalize ureteral stents. This technology has a potential to reduce the need for ureteral stent exchange.",0
"Cystic adenomyosis is a rare type of uterine adenomyosis, mainly seen in young women, which is often characterized by severe dysmenorrhea. The quality of life and reproductive function of young women could be affected by misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. At present, there are no universal guidelines and consensus. We report two cases of patients with cystic adenomyosis in juveniles treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation. In the first case, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated a cystic mass of 2.0 cm × 3.1 cm × 2.4 cm in the uterus. After she underwent HIFU treatment, her pelvic MRI showed a mass of 1.1 × 2.4 cm in size, and her dysmenorrhea symptoms gradually disappeared. In the second case, a pelvic MRI indicated a 5.1 cm × 3.3 cm × 4.7 cm cystic mass in the uterus. After she underwent HIFU and combined four consecutive cycles of GnRH-a treatment, the lesion shrunk 1.2 cm ×1.4 cm × 1.6 cm, without dysmenorrhea. Simultaneously, the report reviewed 14 cases of juvenile cystic adenomyosis over the last ten years. HIFU or HIFU-combined drugs were safe and effective in treating juvenile cystic adenomyosis, but multicenter and prospective studies may be necessary to validate this in the future.",0
"BACKGROUND: Transcranial ultrasound imaging and therapy depend on the efficient transmission of acoustic energy through the skull. Multiple previous studies have concluded that a large incidence angle should be avoided during transcranial-focused ultrasound therapy to ensure transmission through the skull. Alternatively, some other studies have shown that longitudinal-to-shear wave mode conversion might improve transmission through the skull when the incidence angle is increased above the critical angle (i.e., 25° to 30°). PURPOSE: The effect of skull porosity on the transmission of ultrasound through the skull at varying incidence angles was investigated for the first time to elucidate why transmission through the skull at large angles of incidence is decreased in some cases but improved in other cases. METHODS: Transcranial ultrasound transmission at varying incidence angles (0°-50°) was investigated in phantoms and ex vivo skull samples with varying bone porosity (0% to 28.54% ± 3.36%) using both numerical and experimental methods. First, the elastic acoustic wave transmission through the skull was simulated using micro-computed tomography data of ex vivo skull samples. The trans-skull pressure was compared between skull segments having three levels of porosity, that is, low porosity (2.65% ± 0.03%), medium porosity (13.41% ± 0.12%), and high porosity (26.9%). Next, transmission through two 3D-printed resin skull phantoms (compact vs. porous phantoms) was experimentally measured to test the effect of porous microstructure alone on ultrasound transmission through flat plates. Finally, the effect of skull porosity on ultrasound transmission was investigated experimentally by comparing transmission through two ex vivo human skull segments having similar thicknesses but different porosities (13.78% ± 2.05% vs. 28.54% ± 3.36%). RESULTS: Numerical simulations indicated that an increase in transmission pressure occurs at large incidence angles for skull segments having low porosities but not for those with high porosity. In experimental studies, a similar phenomenon was observed. Specifically, for the low porosity skull sample (13.78% ± 2.05%), the normalized pressure was 0.25 when the incidence angle increased to 35°. However, for the high porosity sample (28.54% ± 3.36%), the pressure was no more than 0.1 at large incidence angles. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the skull porosity has an evident effect on the transmission of ultrasound at large incidence angles. The wave mode conversion at large, oblique incidence angles could enhance the transmission of ultrasound through parts of the skull having lower porosity in the trabecular layer. However, for transcranial ultrasound therapy in the presence of highly porous trabecular bone, transmission at a normal incidence angle is preferable relative to oblique incidence angles due to the higher transmission efficiency.",0
"OBJECTIVES: Previously in rodent and swine models, we have shown that external low intensity focused ultrasound (liFUS) can be used to modulate pain responses. To ensure no adverse heating events occur with liFUS modulation in a non-invasive manner, we perform initial work in swine to show that magnetic resonance thermometry imaging (MRTI) is capable of measuring <2.0 °C changes at the L5 DRG. Further, we show that our device can be constructed in an MR-compatible fashion to minimize artifact. METHODS: Three MRTI techniques (referenceless, corrected proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS), and PRFS) were applied to assess accuracy of detecting thermal changes at the L5 DRG in unheated euthanized swine. A region of interest (ROI) that includes the L5 DRG was delineated, within which MRTI temperature changes were spatially averaged (ground truth 0 °C). In separate experiments with phantoms, B0 field-inhomogeneity, RF transmit (B1+) and fast gradient echo (fSPGR) magnitude images were acquired to downselect liFUS device materials that produce the least MRI artifacts. RESULTS: Referenceless, corrected PRFS, and PRFS MRTI resulted in temperature measurements of 0.8 ± 1.1 °C, 1.1 ± 1.3 °C and 5.2 ± 5 °C, respectively. Both materials caused B0 perturbation but minimal B1+ and MRTI artifacts. The presence of imaging artifacts did not preclude thermal imaging of the region. SIGNIFICANCE: We provide preliminary data suggesting that referenceless MRTI can adequately detect small thermal changes at the DRG that may occur with neuromodulation, which is one of the first steps in creating a table of safe parameters for liFUS therapy in humans.",0
"[[gabstract]][] Focused ultrasound (FUS) can temporarily open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and increase the delivery of chemotherapeutics, viral vectors, and other agents to the brain parenchyma. To limit FUS BBB opening to a single brain region, the transcranial acoustic focus of the ultrasound transducer must not be larger than the region targeted. In this work, we design and characterize a therapeutic array optimized for BBB opening at the frontal eye field (FEF) in macaques. We used 115 transcranial simulations in four macaques varying f-number and frequency to optimize the design for focus size, transmission, and small device footprint. The design leverages inward steering for focus tightening, a 1-MHz transmit frequency, and can focus to a simulation predicted 2.5- ± 0.3-mm lateral and 9.5- ± 1.0-mm axial full-width at half-maximum spot size at the FEF without aberration correction. The array is capable of steering axially 35 mm outward, 26 mm inward, and laterally 13 mm with 50% the geometric focus pressure. The simulated design was fabricated, and we characterized the performance of the array using hydrophone beam maps in a water tank and through an ex vivo skull cap to compare measurements with simulation predictions, achieving a 1.8-mm lateral and 9.5-mm axial spot size with a transmission of 37% (transcranial, phase corrected). The transducer produced by this design process is optimized for BBB opening at the FEF in macaques.",0
"A Sonalleve magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) clinical system (Profound Medical, Mississauga, ON, Canada) has been shown to generate nonlinear ultrasound fields with shocks up to 100 MPa at the focus as required for HIFU applications such as boiling histotripsy of hepatic and renal tumors. The Sonalleve system has two versions V1 and V2 of the therapeutic array, with differences in focusing angle, focus depth, arrangement of elements, and the size of a central opening that is twice larger in the V2 system compared to the V1. The goal of this study was to compare the performance of the V1 and V2 transducers for generating high-amplitude shock-wave fields and to reveal the impact of different array geometries on shock amplitudes at the focus. Nonlinear modeling of the field in water using boundary conditions reconstructed from holography measurements shows that at the same power output, the V2 array generates 10-15-MPa lower shock amplitudes at the focus. Consequently, substantially higher power levels are required for the V2 system to reach the same shock-wave exposure conditions in histotripsy-type treatments. Although this difference is mainly caused by the smaller focusing angle of the V2 array, the larger central opening of the V2 array has a nontrivial impact. By excluding coherently interacting weakly focused waves coming from the central part of the source, the presence of the central opening results in a somewhat higher effective focusing angle and thus higher shock amplitudes at the focus. Axisymmetric equivalent source models were constructed for both arrays, and the importance of including the central opening was demonstrated. These models can be used in the ""HIFU beam"" software for simulating nonlinear fields of the Sonalleve V1 and V2 systems in water and flat-layered biological tissues.",0
"Low-intensity ultrasound (LI-US) is a non-invasive stimulation technique that has emerged in recent years and has been shown to have positive effects on neuromodulation, fracture healing, inflammation improvement, and metabolic regulation. This study reports the conclusions of a bibliometric analysis of LI-US. Input data for the period between 1995 and 2022, including 7209 related articles in the field of LI-US, were collected from the core library of the Web of Science (WOS) database. Using these data, a set of bibliometric indicators was obtained to gain knowledge on different aspects: global production, research areas, and sources analysis, contributions of countries and institutions, author analysis, citation analysis, and keyword analysis. This study combined the data analysis capabilities provided by the WOS database, making use of two bibliometric software tools: R software and VOS viewer to achieve analysis and data exploration visualization, and predicted the further development trends of LI-US. It turns out that the United States and China are co-leaders while Zhang ZG is the most significant author in LI-US. In the future, the hot spots of LI-US will continue to focus on parameter research, mechanism discussion, safety regulations, and neuromodulation applications.",0
"PURPOSE: Previous ultrasonographic studies of individuals with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) have shown nerve enlargement at several sites. This prospective study compares only the bilateral median and ulnar nerves of individuals with CIDP with reference values to determine the clinical usefulness of this focused approach as a diagnostic tool. METHODS: The cross-sectional area, echogenicity, and vascularity of the bilateral median and ulnar nerves of 25 subjects with CIDP were measured using ultrasound. Nineteen had typical CIDP based on the European Federation of Neurological Societies and the Peripheral Nerve Society guidelines, whereas six had atypical CIDP and were diagnosed based on clinical impression. RESULTS: Focal nerve enlargement was found in at least one segment in all subjects. Subjects with typical CIDP had larger cross-sectional areas compared with subjects with atypical CIDP. CONCLUSION: A focused ultrasound study, involving only the median and ulnar nerves, is sensitive for the detection of nerve enlargement in CIDP. Measuring the cross-sectional area of the median and ulnar nerves is clinically feasible and may help establish the diagnosis of CIDP.",0
"BACKGROUND: MR-guided focused ultrasound is a promising intervention for treatment-resistant mental illness, and merits contextualized ethical exploration in relation to more extensive ethical literature regarding other psychosurgical and neuromodulation treatment options for this patient population. To our knowledge, this topic has not yet been explored in the published literature. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss in detail the neuroethical implications of MR-guided focused ultrasound for neuropsychiatric illness as an emerging treatment modality. METHODS: Due to the lack of published literature on the topic, the approach involved a detailed survey and review of technical and medical literature relevant to focused ultrasound and established ethical issues related to alternative treatment options for patients with treatment-resistant, severe and persistent mental illness. The manuscript is structured according to thematic and topical findings. RESULTS: This technology has potential benefits for patients suffering with severe mental illness, compared with established alternatives. The balance of technical, neuroscientific and clinical considerations should inform ethical deliberations. The nascent literature base, nuances in legal classification and permissibility depending upon jurisdiction, influences of past ethical issues associated with alternative treatments, tone and framing in media articles, and complexity of clinical trials all influence ethical assessment and evaluations of multiple stakeholders. Recommendations for future research are provided based on these factors. CONCLUSION: Salient ethical inquiry should be further explored by researchers, clinicians, and ethicists in a nuanced manner methodologically, one which is informed by past and present ethical issues related to alternative treatment options, broader psychiatric treatment frameworks, pragmatic implementation challenges, intercultural considerations, and patients' ethical concerns.",0
"BabelBrain is an open-source standalone graphic-user-interface application designed for studies of neuromodulation using transcranial focused ultrasound. It calculates the transmitted acoustic field in the brain tissue, taking into account the distortion effects caused by the skull barrier. The simulation is prepared using scans from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, if available, computed tomography and zero-echo time MRI scans. It also calculates the thermal effects based on a given ultrasound regime, such as the total duration of exposure, the duty cycle, and acoustic intensity. The tool is designed to work in tandem with neuronavigation and visualization software, such as 3DSlicer. It uses image processing to prepare domains for ultrasound simulation and uses the BabelViscoFDTD library for transcranial modeling calculations. BabelBrain supports multiple GPU backends, including Metal, OpenCL, and CUDA, and works on all major operating systems including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This tool is particularly optimized for Apple ARM64 systems, which are common in brain imaging research. The paper presents the modeling pipeline used in BabelBrain and a numerical study where different methods of acoustic properties mapping were tested to select the best method that can reproduce the transcranial pressure transmission efficiency reported in the literature.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) provides the spatial information of acoustic energy emitted from microbubbles during focused ultrasound (FUS), which can be used for safety and efficacy monitoring of blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening. In our previous work with a neuronavigation-guided FUS system, only part of the cavitation signal could be monitored in real time due to the computational burden although full-burst analysis is required to detect transient and stochastic cavitation activity. In addition, the spatial resolution of PAM can be limited for a small-aperture receiving array transducer. For full-burst real-time PAM with enhanced resolution, we developed a parallel processing scheme for coherence-factor-based PAM (CF-PAM) and implemented it onto the neuronavigation-guided FUS system using a co-axial phased-array imaging transducer. METHODS: Simulation and in-vitro human skull studies were conducted for the performance evaluation of the proposed method in terms of spatial resolution and processing speed. We also carried out real-time cavitation mapping during BBB opening in non-human primates (NHPs). RESULTS: CF-PAM with the proposed processing scheme provided better resolution than that of traditional time-exposure-acoustics PAM with a higher processing speed than that of eigenspace-based robust Capon beamformer, which facilitated the full-burst PAM with the integration time of 10 ms at a rate of 2 Hz. In vivo feasibility of PAM with the co-axial imaging transducer was also demonstrated in two NHPs, showing the advantages of using real-time B-mode and full-burst PAM for accurate targeting and safe treatment monitoring. SIGNIFICANCE: This full-burst PAM with enhanced resolution will facilitate the clinical translation of online cavitation monitoring for safe and efficient BBB opening.",0
"The last two decades have seen dramatic growth in the application of procedurally based interventions for treating refractory psychiatric conditions, leading to interest in developing the foundations for the subspecialty of ""Interventional Psychiatry."" However, there is cause for concern that the rate of expansion of clinical advances in this field may be outpacing the ability of postgraduate curricula to provide sufficient exposure to and teaching and supervision of these treatments. The paucity of adequately trained practitioners in Interventional Psychiatry further exacerbates inequities in the ability of eligible patients to access and benefit from these approaches. This paper explores the rates of utilization of Interventional Psychiatry treatments, the current state of education in these treatments, and the role that training can play in translating scientific advances in this area to ensure equitable access and maximum impact at a population level. The majority of the discussion is centered on electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the most established and available of these treatments, highlighting how enhancing education and training in ECT can reduce barriers to its utilization. It is argued that innovations in pedagogical approaches for disseminating the learning of these procedures are needed to increase the current low rates of competency in these treatments and can facilitate the more rapid dissemination of other Interventional Psychiatry approaches and neurotechnologies, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, deep brain stimulation, and focused ultrasound.",0
"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising non-invasive technique for treating solid tumors using thermal and histotripsy-based mechanical ablation. However, its clinical significance in different tumor types is not fully understood. To assess its therapeutic efficacy and immunomodulatory properties, we compared HIFU thermal ablation and histotripsy ablation in dogs with spontaneous tumors. We also evaluated the ability of non-ablative HIFU-based mild hyperthermia (40-45 ºC) to improve Doxorubicin delivery and immunomodulation. Our results showed that HIFU thermal ablation induced tumor remission in the majority of treated patients over 60 days, while histotripsy achieved partial response to stable disease persistence. The adverse effects of thermal ablation were minor to moderate, while histotripsy exposures were relatively well-tolerated. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between HIFU-therapeutic response and serum anti-tumor cytokine profiles and the presence of functionally active cytotoxic immune cells in patients. Similarly, Doxorubicin-treated patients showed improved drug delivery, efficacy, and anti-tumor immune responses with HIFU hyperthermia. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that depending on the tumor type and treatment parameters, HIFU treatments can enable tumor growth control, immune activation, and chemotherapy in veterinary patient. These findings have significant clinical implications and highlight the potential of HIFU as a promising cancer treatment approach.",0
"An accurate method for neural stimulation within the brain could be very useful for treating brain circuit dysfunctions and neurological disorders. With the aim of developing such a method, this study investigated the use of piezoelectric molybdenum disulfide nanosheets (MoS2 NS) to remotely convert ultrasound energy into localized electrical stimulation in vitro and in vivo. The application of ultrasound to cells surrounding MoS2 NS required only a single pulse of 2 MHz ultrasound (400 kPa, 1,000,000 cycles, and 500 ms pulse duration) to elicit significant responses in 37.9 ± 7.4% of cells in terms of fluxes of calcium ions without detectable cellular damage. The proportion of responsive cells was mainly influenced by the acoustic pressure, number of ultrasound cycles, and concentration of MoS2 NS. Tests using appropriate blockers revealed that voltage-gated membrane channels were activated. In vivo data suggested that, with ultrasound stimulation, neurons closest to the MoS2 NS were 3-fold more likely to present c-Fos expression than cells far from the NS. The successful activation of neurons surrounding MoS2 NS suggests that this represents a method with high spatial precision for selectively modulating one or several targeted brain circuits.",0
"Organ biobanking is the pending subject of cryopreservation. Although the problem is multifaceted, advances in recent decades have largely related it to achieving rapid and uniform rewarming of cryopreserved samples. This is a physical challenge largely investigated in past in addition to cryoprotectant toxicity studies, which have also shown a great amount of advancement. This paper presents a proof-of-principle, based on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, of a technology capable of performing such a function: high intensity focused ultrasound. Thus, avoiding the problem of recrystallization, this worm, in its adult state, preserved at - [Formula: see text], has been systematically brought back to life after being heated with High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) waves. The great advantage of this technology is that it is scalable; in addition, rewarming can be monitored in real time by MRI thermography and can be controlled by acoustic interferometry. We anticipate that our findings are the starting point for a possible approach to rewarming that can be used for cryopreservation of millimeter scale systems: either alone or in combination with other promising ways of heating, like nanowarming or dielectric heating, the present technology provides new ways of solving the physical aspects of the problem of recrystallization in cryopreservation, opening the door for the long-term storage of larger samples.",0
"Ultrasound has been proven to enhance the mass transfer process and impact the fabrication of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO). However, the different effects of ultrasound propagating in different media make the specific target and process of ultrasound in AAO remain unclear, and the effects of ultrasound on AAO reported in previous studies are contradictory. These uncertainties have greatly limited the application of ultrasonic-assisted anodization (UAA) in practice. In this study, the bubble desorption and mass transfer enhancement effects were decoupled based on an anodizing system with focused ultrasound, such that the dual effects of ultrasound on different targets were distinguished. The results showed that ultrasound has the dual effects on AAO fabrication. Specifically, ultrasound focused on the anode has a nanopore-expansion effect on AAO, leading to a 12.24 % improvement in fabrication efficiency. This was attributed to the promotion of interfacial ion migration through ultrasonic-induced high-frequency vibrational bubble desorption. However, AAO nanopores were observed to shrink when ultrasound was focused on the electrolyte, accompanied by a 25.85 % reduction in fabrication efficiency. The effects of ultrasound on mass transfer through jet cavitation appeared to be the reason for this phenomenon. This study resolved the paradoxical phenomena of UAA in previous studies and is expected to guide AAO application in electrochemistry and surface treatments.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a new non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) modality, with its exquisite ability to reach deep brain areas at a high spatial resolution. Accurate placement of an acoustic focus to a target region of the brain is crucial during tFUS treatment; however, the distortion of acoustic wave propagation through the intact skull casts challenges. High-resolution numerical simulation allows for monitoring of the acoustic pressure field in the cranium but also demands extensive computational loads. In this study, we adopt a super-resolution residual network technique based on a deep convolution to enhance the prediction quality of the FUS acoustic pressure field in the targeted brain regions. METHODS: The training dataset was acquired by numerical simulations performed at low-(1.0 mm) and high-resolutions (0.5mm) on three ex vivo human calvariae. Five different super-resolution (SR) network models were trained by using a multivariable dataset in 3D, which incorporated information on the acoustic pressure field, wave velocity, and localized skull computed tomography (CT) images. RESULTS: The accuracy of 80.87±4.50% in predicting the focal volume with a substantial improvement of 86.91% in computational cost compared to the conventional high-resolution numerical simulation was achieved. The results suggest that the method can greatly reduce the simulation time without sacrificing accuracy and improve the accuracy further with the use of additional inputs. CONCLUSIONS: In this research, we developed multivariable-incorporating SR neural networks for transcranial focused ultrasound simulation. Our super-resolution technique may contribute to promoting the safety and efficacy of tFUS-mediated NIBS by providing on-site feedback information on the intracranial pressure field to the operator.",0
"Fiber-optic hydrophones (FOHs) are widely used to detect high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) fields. The most common type consists of an uncoated single-mode fiber with a perpendicularly cleaved end face. The main disadvantage of these hydrophones is their low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To increase the SNR, signal averaging is performed, but the associated increased acquisition times hinder ultrasound field scans. In this study, with a view to increasing SNR while withstanding HIFU pressures, the bare FOH paradigm is extended to include a partially reflective coating on the fiber end face. Here, a numerical model based on the general transfer-matrix method was implemented. Based on the simulation results, a single-layer, 172 nm TiO2-coated FOH was fabricated. The frequency range of the hydrophone was verified from 1 to 30 MHz. The SNR of the acoustic measurement with the coated sensor was 21 dB higher than that of the uncoated one. The coated sensor successfully withstood a peak positive pressure of 35 MPa for 6000 pulses.",0
"We present an all-optical focused ultrasound transducer with a sub-millimeter aperture and demonstrate its capability for high-resolution imaging of tissue ex vivo. The transducer is composed of a wideband silicon photonics ultrasound detector and a miniature acoustic lens coated with a thin optically absorbing metallic layer used to produce laser-generated ultrasound. The demonstrated device achieves axial resolution and lateral resolutions of 12 μm and 60 μm, respectively, well below typical values achieved by conventional piezoelectric intravascular ultrasound. The size and resolution of the developed transducer may enable its use for intravascular imaging of thin fibrous cap atheroma.",0
"Adoptive T-cell therapy against solid tumours is limited by the apoptosis resistance mechanisms of tumour cells and by the extracellular, immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. Here we report a temperature-sensitive genome-editing nanodevice that can deliver a Cas9 editor with an external trigger which can be used to edit the genome of tumour cells to reduce resistance to apoptosis and modulate the tumour microenvironment via a mild heating trigger. After local or systemic delivery of Cas9, mild heating is induced by non-invasive near-infrared (NIR) light or focused ultrasound (FUS) to activate Cas9, which initiates simultaneous genome editing of HSP70 (HSPA1A) and BAG3 in tumour cells. This disrupts the apoptotic resistance machinery of the tumour cells against adoptive T cells. At the same time, an NIR- or FUS-induced mild thermal effect reshapes the extracellular tumour microenvironment by disrupting the physical barriers and immune suppression. This facilitates the infiltration of adoptive T cells and enhances their therapeutic activity. Mild thermal Cas9 delivery is demonstrated in different murine tumour models which mimic a range of clinical indications, including a tumour model based on humanized patient-derived xenografts. As a result, the non-invasive thermal delivery of Cas9 significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacies of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and chimeric antigen receptor T and shows potential for clinical application.",0
"Inertial Microcavitation Rheometry (IMR) is a promising tool for characterizing the mechanical behavior of soft materials at high strain rates. In IMR, an isolated, spherical microbubble is generated inside a soft material, using either a spatially-focused pulsed laser or focused ultrasound, to probe the mechanical behavior of the soft material at high strain rates (>103 s-1). Then, a theoretical modeling framework for inertial microcavitation, incorporating all the dominant physics, is used to extract information regarding the mechanical behavior of the soft material by fitting model predictions to the experimentally measured bubble dynamics. To model the cavitation dynamics, approaches based on extensions of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation are commonly used; however, these approaches cannot consider bubble dynamics that involves appreciable compressible behavior and place a limit on the nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive models that may be employed to describe the soft material. To circumvent these limitations, in this work, we develop a finite-element-based numerical simulation capability for inertial microcavitation of spherical bubbles that enables appreciable compressibility to be accounted for and more complex viscoelastic constitutive laws to be incorporated. We first apply the numerical simulation capability to understanding the role of material compressibility during violent spherical bubble collapse, and based on finite-element simulations, we propose a Mach-number-based threshold of 0.08, beyond which bubble collapse is violent, and the bubble dynamics involves compressibility not accounted for in Rayleigh-Plesset-based approaches. Second, we consider more complex viscoelastic constitutive models for the surrounding material, including nonlinear elastic and power-law viscous behavior, and apply IMR by fitting computational results to experimental data from inertial microcavitation of polyacrylamide (PA) gels in order to determine material parameters for PA gels at high strain rates.",0
"Cancer is one of the diseases with high mortality worldwide. Various methods for cancer treatment are being developed, and among them, magnetically driven microrobots capable of minimally invasive surgery and accurate targeting are in the spotlight. However, existing medical magnetically manipulated microrobots contain magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which can cause toxicity to normal cells after the delivery of therapeutic drugs. In addition, there is a limitation in that cancer cells become resistant to the drug by mainly delivering only one drug, thereby reducing the treatment efficiency. In this paper, to overcome these limitations, we propose a microrobot that can separate/retrieve MNPs after precise targeting of the microrobot and can sequentially deliver dual drugs (gemcitabine (GEM) and doxorubicin (DOX)). First, after the proposed microrobot targeting, MNPs attached to the microrobot surface can be separated from the microrobot using focused ultrasound (FUS) and retrieved through an external magnetic field. Second, the active release of the first conjugated drug GEM to the surface of the microrobot is possible using near-infrared (NIR), and as the microrobot slowly decomposes over time, the release of the second encapsulated DOX is possible. Therefore, it is possible to increase the cancer cell treatment efficiency with sequential dual drugs in the microrobot. We performed basic experiments on the targeting of the proposed magnetically manipulated microrobot, separation/retrieval of MNPs, and the sequential dual-drug release and validated the performances of the microrobot through in vitro experiments using the EMA/FUS/NIR integrated system. As a result, the proposed microrobot is expected to be used as one of the methods to improve cancer cell treatment efficiency by improving the limitations of existing microrobots in cancer cell treatment.",0
"BACKGROUND: The persistent development of focused ultrasound (FUS) thermal therapy in the context of oncology creates the need for tissue-mimicking tumor phantom models for early-stage experimentation and evaluation of relevant systems and protocols. PURPOSE: This study presents the development and evaluation of a tumor-bearing tissue phantom model for testing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided FUS (MRgFUS) ablation protocols and equipment based on MR thermometry. METHODS: Normal tissue was mimicked by a pure agar gel, while the tumor simulator was differentiated from the surrounding material by including silicon dioxide. The phantom was characterized in terms of acoustic, thermal, and MRI properties. US, MRI, and computed tomography (CT) images of the phantom were acquired to assess the contrast between the two compartments. The phantom's response to thermal heating was investigated by performing high power sonications with a 2.4 MHz single element spherically focused ultrasonic transducer in a 3T MRI scanner. RESULTS: The estimated phantom properties fall within the range of literature-reported values of soft tissues. The inclusion of silicon dioxide in the tumor material offered excellent tumor visualization in US, MRI, and CT. MR thermometry revealed temperature elevations in the phantom to ablation levels and clear evidence of larger heat accumulation within the tumor owing to the inclusion of silicon dioxide. CONCLUSION: Overall, the study findings suggest that the proposed tumor phantom model constitutes a simple and inexpensive tool for preclinical MRgFUS ablation studies, and potentially other image-guided thermal ablation applications upon minimal modifications.",0
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) enables localized ablation of biological tissues by capitalizing on the synergistic effects of heating and cavitation. Monitoring of those effects is essential for improving the efficacy and safety of HIFU interventions. Herein, we suggest a hybrid optoacoustic-ultrasound (OPUS) approach for real-time assessment of heating and cavitation processes while providing an essential anatomical reference for accurate localization of the HIFU-induced lesion. Both effects could clearly be observed by exploiting the temperature dependence of optoacoustic (OA) signals and the strong contrast of gas bubbles in pulse-echo ultrasound (US) images. The differences in temperature increase and its rate, as recorded with a thermal camera for different HIFU pressures, evinced the onset of cavitation at the expected pressure threshold. The estimated temperatures based on OA signal variations were also within 10-20 % agreement with the camera readings for temperatures below the coagulation threshold (∼50 °C). Experiments performed in excised tissues as well as in a post-mortem mouse demonstrate that both heating and cavitation effects can be effectively visualized and tracked using the OPUS approach. The good sensitivity of the suggested method for HIFU monitoring purposes was manifested by a significant increase in contrast-to-noise ratio within the ablated region by > 10 dB and > 5 dB for the OA and US images, respectively. The hybrid OPUS-based monitoring approach offers the ease of handheld operation thus can readily be implemented in a bedside setting to benefit several types of HIFU treatments used in the clinics.",0
"Minimally invasive ablation has been widely applied for treatment of various solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast carcinomas, etc. In addition to removing the primary tumor lesion, ablative techniques are also capable of improving the anti-tumor immune response by inducing immunogenic tumor cell death and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, which may be of great benefit to inhibit the recurrent metastasis of residual tumor. However, the short-acting activated anti-tumor immunity of post-ablation will rapidly reverse into an immunosuppressive state, and the recurrent metastasis owing to incomplete ablation is closely associated with a dismal prognosis for the patients. In recent years, numerous nanoplatforms have been developed to improve the local ablative effect through enhancing the targeting delivery and combining it with chemotherapy. Particularly, amplifying the anti-tumor immune stimulus signal, modulating the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and improving the anti-tumor immune response with the versatile nanoplatforms have heralded great application prospects for improving the local control and preventing tumor recurrence and distant metastasis. This review discusses recent advances in nanoplatform-potentiated ablation-immune synergistic tumor therapy, focusing on common ablation techniques including radiofrequency, microwave, laser, and high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation, cryoablation, and magnetic hyperthermia ablation, etc. We discuss the advantages and challenges of the corresponding therapies and propose possible directions for future research, which is expected to provide references for improving the traditional ablation efficacy.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI allows to investigte neural activities and connectivity. While the non-human primate plays an essential role in neuroscience research, multimodal methods combining functional MRI with other neuroimaging and neuromodulation enable us to understand the brain network at multiple scales. APPROACH: In this study, a tight-fitting helmet-shape receive array with a single transmit loop for anesthetized macaque brain MRI at 7T was fabricated with four openings constructed in the coil housing to accommodate multimodal devices, and the coil performance was quantitatively evaluated and compared to a commercial knee coil. In addition, experiments over three macaques with infrared neural stimulation (INS), focused ultrasound stimulation (FUS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) were conducted. MAIN RESULTS: The RF coil showed higher transmit efficiency, comparable homogeneity, improved SNR and enlarged signal coverage over the macaque brain. Infrared neural stimulation was applied to the amygdala in deep brain region, and activations in stimulation sites and connected sites were detected, with the connectivity consistent with anatomical information. Focused ultrasound stimulation was applied to the left visual cortex, and activations were acquired along the ultrasound traveling path, with all time course curves consistent with pre-designed paradigms. The existence of transcranial direct current stimulation electrodes brought no interference to the RF system, as evidenced through high-resolution MPRAGE structure images. SIGNIFICANCE: This pilot study reveals the feasibility for brain investigation at multiple spatiotemporal scales, which may advance our understanding in dynamic brain networks.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to study microbubble-enhanced temperature elevation with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) at different acoustic pressures and under image guidance. The microbubbles were administered with either local or vascular injections (that mimic systemic injections) in perfused and non-perfused ex vivo porcine liver under ultrasound image guidance. METHODS: Porcine liver was insonified for 30 s with a single-element HIFU transducer (0.9 MHz, 0.413 ms, 82% duty cycle, focal pressures of 0.6-3.5 MPa). Contrast microbubbles were injected either locally or through the vasculature. A needle thermocouple at the focus measured temperature elevation. Diagnostic ultrasound (Philips iU22, C5-1 probe) guided placement of the thermocouple and delivery of microbubbles and monitored the procedure in real time. RESULTS: At lower acoustic pressures (0.6 and 1.2 MPa) in non-perfused liver, inertial cavitation of the injected microbubbles led to greater temperatures at the focus compared with HIFU-only treatments. At higher pressures (2.4 and 3.5 MPa) native inertial cavitation in the tissue (without injecting microbubbles) resulted in temperature elevations similar to those after injecting microbubbles. The heated area was larger when using microbubbles at all pressures. In the presence of perfusion, only local injections provided a sufficiently high concentration of microbubbles necessary for significant temperature enhancement. CONCLUSION: Local injections of microbubbles provide a higher concentration of microbubbles in a smaller area, avoiding acoustic shadowing, and can lead to higher temperature elevation at lower pressures and increase the size of the heated area at all pressures.",0
"PURPOSE: In high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment of the kidney and liver, tracking the organs is essential because respiratory motions make continuous cauterization of the affected area difficult and may cause damage to other parts of the body. In this study, we propose a tracking system for rotational scanning, and propose and evaluate a method for estimating the angles of organs in ultrasound images. METHODS: We proposed AEMA, AEMAD, and AEMAD++ as methods for estimating the angles of organs in ultrasound images, using RUDS and a phantom to acquire 90-degree images of a kidney from the long-axis image to the short-axis image as a data set. Six datasets were used, with five for preliminary preparation and one for testing, while the initial position was shifted by 2 mm in the contralateral axis direction. The test data set was evaluated by estimating the angle using each method. RESULTS: The accuracy and processing speed of angle estimation for AEMA, AEMAD, and AEMAD++ were 23.8% and 0.33 FPS for AEMAD, 32.0% and 0.56 FPS for AEMAD, and 29.5% and 3.20 FPS for AEMAD++, with tolerance of ± 2.5 degrees. AEMAD++ offered the best speed and accuracy. CONCLUSION: In the phantom experiment, AEMAD++ showed the effectiveness of tracking the long-axis image of the kidney in rotational scanning. In the future, we will add either the area of surrounding organs or the internal structure of the kidney as a new feature to validate the results.",0
"Objective:Focused ultrasound (FUS) neuromodulation non-invasively alters brain activity, likely via acoustic radiation force (ARF) with dynamics of the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). PRF impacts neuromodulation as well as indirect auditory activation, a confound linked to skull vibrations. This study aimed to minimize these vibrations, by adjusting and randomizing PRF, and determine their impact on FUS-induced motor activity. We hypothesized that: the skull would vibrate most at a specific PRF; randomizing PRF would reduce skull vibrations without affecting motor responses; and FUS would yield motor activity while actuator-induced skull vibrations would not.Approach:Three objectives were studied in parallel using C57Bl/6 mice (n= number of mice used per objective). First, skull vibration amplitude, measured as a percentage of maximum amplitude per treatment, was recorded via contact microphone over a range of PRFs to assess the PRF-dependency of skull vibrations (n= 19). Vibrations were then compared between random and fixed PRFs (n= 15). Lastly, motor responses were compared between fixed 1.5 kHz PRF FUS, random PRF FUS, air-puff stimulation, sham stimulation, and vibration induction via piezoelectric actuator (n= 30).Main Results:The study found amplitude peaked at 1.51 kHz (88.1 ± 11.5%), significantly higher than at 0.54 kHz (75.5 ± 15.1%;p= 0.0149). Random PRF reduced amplitude by 4.2% (p= 0.0181). Motor response rates to actuator-induced skull vibrations at the PRF (5.73 ± 6.96%) and its third harmonic (22.9 ± 22.7%) were not significantly different than sham (14.1 ± 11.6%), but lower than FUS (70.2 ± 16.3%;p< 0.0001).Significance:Based on these results, PRF near 0.5 kHz may best avoid skull vibrations, while random PRF could be utilized to slightly reduce vibration amplitude. The results also suggested that skull vibrations likely do not significantly impact motor responses to FUS neuromodulation.",0
"Focused ultrasound (FUS) peripheral neuromodulation has been linked to nerve displacement caused by the acoustic radiation force; however, the roles of cavitation and temperature accumulation on nerve modulation are less clear, as are the relationships between these three mechanisms of action. Temperature directly changes tissue stiffness and viscosity. Viscoelastic properties have been shown to affect cavitation thresholds in both theoretical and ex vivo models, but the direct effect of temperature on cavitation has not been investigated in vivo. Here, cavitation and tissue displacement were simultaneously mapped in response to baseline tissue temperatures of either 30°C or 38°C during sciatic nerve sonication in mice. In each mouse, the sciatic nerve was repeatedly sonicated at 1.1 MHz, 4 MPa peak-negative pressure, 5 ms pulse duration, and either 15 Hz or 30 Hz pulse repetition frequency for 10 s at each tissue temperature. Cavitation increased by 1.8-4.5 dB at a tissue temperature of 38°C compared to 30°C, as measured both by passive cavitation images and cavitation doses. Tissue displacement also increased by 1.3-1.8 μm at baseline temperatures of 38°C compared to 30°C. Histological findings indicated small increases in red blood cell extravasation in the 38°C baseline temperature condition compared to 30°C at both PRFs. A strong positive correlation was found between the inertial cavitation dose and displacement imaging noise, indicating the potential ability of displacement imaging to simultaneously detect inertial cavitation in vivo. Overall, tissue temperature was found to modulate both in vivo cavitation and tissue displacement, and thus both tissue temperature and cavitation can be monitored during FUS to ensure both safety and efficiency.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) for the treatment of facet joint mediated pain in human subjects who failed conventional treatment. Secondarily, to evaluate effectiveness of the procedure. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent MRgFUS at our institution were retrospectively identified. Chart review was performed to obtain relevant clinical and technical data. All patients had chronic low back pain and positive comparative medial branch blocks. RESULTS: Twenty-six MRgFUS treatments in 20 patients were included. Mean sonication energy was 1436.6 Joules. The procedure was technically successful in all patients. 29.6% of patients experienced short-term worsening of low back pain immediately following the procedure, all by 1-4 points on a 0-10 scale. One patient (3.8%) reported temporary worsening of pre-existing radicular symptoms after the procedure. Of 21 patients with clinical follow up of at least 3 months available, 12 (57.1%) had >3 months pain relief, 2 (10%) had <3 months benefit, 6 (30%) reported no benefit, and 1 (5%) patient was lost to follow up. In patients who reported at least some benefit to prior conventional RF ablation, 8/10 (80%) benefitted from the MRgFUS procedure. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that MRI-guided focused ultrasound ablation of the lumbar facet joints is a safe and tolerable procedure in human subjects, and may provide another option for patients who fail RFA. Over half of all patients received significant durable pain relief, which jumped to 80% for patients who had at least some benefit from prior RF ablations.",0
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of neurodegenerative cognitive impairment. Brain stimulation techniques based on the delivery of transcranial shockwaves are currently being studied for their increasing popularity as an approach to modulate the human brain in a focal and targeted manner making this therapy a promising line of action against AD. In the present manuscript, we review for further understanding whether transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) is a beneficial treatment for AD patients. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases were accessed with the search criteria set from year 2001 to 2022 and the following keywords were used: ""transcranial pulse stimulation"", ""focused ultrasound"", ""noninvasive treatment and Alzheimer"" and ""TPS"". The search was focused on papers that provide evidence on the biological bases of the method, as well as its safety and tolerability. Even though more studies are needed with greater scientific rigor, such as a double-blind and randomized study versus a placebo, TPS is an excellent and safe therapeutic option for AD. This novel approach accompanies currently available treatments and complements them, helping to maintain greater stability of the disease and slowing its progression. The biological effects and potential mechanisms of action of TPS for the improvement of cognitive function are further discussed.",0
"PURPOSE: Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, the main component of amyloid plaques found in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, are implicated in its pathogenesis, and are considered a key target in AD therapeutics. We herein propose a reliable strategy for non-invasively delivering a specific anti-Aβ antibody in a mouse model of AD by microbubbles-enhanced Focused Ultrasound (FUS)-mediated Blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD), using a simple single stage MR-compatible positioning device. METHODS: The initial experimental work involved wild-type mice and was devoted to selecting the sonication protocol for efficient and safe BBBD. Pulsed FUS was applied using a single-element FUS transducer of 1 MHz (80 mm radius of curvature and 50 mm diameter). The success and extent of BBBD were assessed by Evans Blue extravasation and brain damage by hematoxylin and eosin staining. 5XFAD mice were divided into different subgroups; control (n = 1), FUS + MBs alone (n = 5), antibody alone (n = 5), and FUS + antibody combined (n = 10). The changes in antibody deposition among groups were determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: It was confirmed that the antibody could not normally enter the brain parenchyma. A single treatment with MBs-enhanced pulsed FUS using the optimized protocol (1 MHz, 0.5 MPa in-situ pressure, 10 ms bursts, 1% duty factor, 100 s duration) transiently disrupted the BBB allowing for non-invasive antibody delivery to amyloid plaques within the sonicated brain regions. This was consistently reproduced in ten mice. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings should be confirmed by longer-term studies examining the antibody effects on plaque clearance and cognitive benefit to hold promise for developing disease-modifying anti-Aβ therapeutics for clinical use.",0
"Transport of interstitial fluid and solutes plays a critical role in clearing metabolic waste from the brain. Transcranial application of focused ultrasound (FUS) has been shown to promote localized cerebrospinal fluid solute uptake into the brain parenchyma; however, its effects on the transport and clearance of interstitial solutes remain unknown. We demonstrate that pulsed application of low-intensity FUS to the rat brain enhances the transport of intracortically injected fluorescent tracers (ovalbumin and high molecular-weight dextran), yielding greater parenchymal tracer volume distribution compared to the unsonicated control group (ovalbumin by 40.1% and dextran by 34.6%). Furthermore, FUS promoted the drainage of injected interstitial ovalbumin to both superficial and deep cervical lymph nodes (cLNs) ipsilateral to sonication, with 78.3% higher drainage observed in the superficial cLNs compared to the non-sonicated hemisphere. The application of FUS increased the level of solute transport visible from the dorsal brain surface, with ~ 43% greater area and ~ 19% higher fluorescence intensity than the unsonicated group, especially in the pial surface ipsilateral to sonication. The sonication did not elicit tissue-level neuronal excitation, measured by an electroencephalogram, nor did it alter the molecular weight of the tracers. These findings suggest that nonthermal transcranial FUS can enhance advective transport of interstitial solutes and their subsequent removal in a completely non-invasive fashion, offering its potential non-pharmacological utility in facilitating clearance of waste from the brain.",0
"Sonodynamic therapy has emerged as an encouraging non-invasive technique that uses ultrasound to activate targeted agents to induce anti-tumor effects for the treatment of glioma. With extensive variation in the types of sonosensitizers, protocols for sonication, and model systems, a comprehensive overview of existing pre-clinical data on the efficacy of SDT in glioma treatment is warranted. Here, we conduct a systematic review of pre-clinical and early clinical literature on implementing sonodynamic therapy (SDT) to treat in-vitro and in-vivo models of glioma. Our findings suggest that coupling sonosensitizers such as 5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA), hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) and sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS) with focused ultrasound induces robust cytotoxic activity in tumor cells (in-vitro and in-vivo). These effects are likely mediated by the oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptotic signaling cascades, and intracellular calcium overload. Future research is needed to better understand the biochemical and mechanistic properties of sonodynamic therapy, and ongoing trials may help elucidate the clinical feasibility of glioma treatment with optimized sonically activated treatments.",0
"Insulin therapy is the most effective way to control the blood glucose value of diabetic patients. The most effective administration route for insulin is subcutaneous injection because bioavailability for non-injection administration is low and unstable. However, patients often need a multiple daily insulin injection regimen to control basal and postprandial blood glucose, which causes various complications. Controlled pulsatile drug release technology using ultrasound as an external stimulus source is a very promising method to avoid multiple injections of insulin. However, most of the drug-loaded microbubbles used for ultrasound-mediated treatment have a short half-life, which limits their use in controlled pulsatile drug release. More importantly, how to control insulin release is still a challenge. In this paper, chitosan poly-acrylic acid nanobubbles as drug carriers of insulin were prepared to achieve a visually controlled pulsatile release of insulin triggered by focused ultrasound. The experimental results in vivo demonstrated that nanobubbles were stable enough to achieve long-term visualization for 7 days after intramuscular injection in rats. Under the guidance of ultrasound imaging, it is visible to find the position and observe the gray values change of nanobubbles. Thus, when triggered by focused ultrasound, the amount of insulin could be accurately pulsatile released from nanobubbles. In vivo experiments in rats showed that the visually controlled pulsatile release of insulin could be achieved for a long time, up to 3 consecutive days. The blood glucose level could be repeatedly reduced by focused ultrasound irradiation with just one injection. Our research provided a promising way for visually controlled pulsatile release of insulin, which would significantly reduce the injection frequency of insulin.",0
"BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy has been implemented as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of drug-refractory essential tremor (ET). However, its impact on the brain structural network is still unclear. PURPOSE: To investigate both global and local alterations of the white matter (WM) connectivity network in ET after MRgFUS thalamotomy. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. SUBJECTS: Twenty-seven ET patients (61 ± 11 years, 19 males) with MRgFUS thalamotomy and 28 healthy controls (HC) (61 ± 11 years, 20 males) were recruited for comparison. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 3 T/single shell diffusion tensor imaging by using spin-echo-based echo-planar imaging, three-dimensional T1 weighted imaging by using gradient-echo-based sequence. ASSESSMENT: Patients were undergoing MRgFUS thalamotomy and their clinical data were collected from pre-operation to 6-month post-operation. Network topological metrics, including rich-club organization, small-world, and efficiency properties were calculated. Correlation between the topological metrics and tremor scores in ET groups was also calculated to assess the role of neural remodeling in the brain. STATISTICAL TESTS: Two-sample independent t-tests, chi-squared test, ANOVA, Bonferroni test, and Spearman's correlation. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: For ET patients, the strength of rich-club connection and clustering coefficient significantly increased vs. characteristic path length decreased at 6-month post-operation compared with pre-operation. The distribution pattern of rich-club regions was different in ET groups. Specifically, the order of the rich-club regions was changed according to the network degree value after MRgFUS thalamotomy. Moreover, the altered nodal efficiency in the right temporal pole of the superior temporal gyrus (R = 0.434-0.596) and right putamen (R = 0.413-0.436) was positively correlated with different tremor improvement. DATA CONCLUSION: These findings might improve understanding of treatment-induced modulation from a network perspective and may work as an objective marker in the assessment of ET tremor control with MRgFUS thalamotomy.

"Calcineurin inhibitor-related tremors occur in up to 50% of solid organ transplant recipients and are disabling in severe cases. We describe a bilateral lung transplant recipient with essential tremors that significantly worsened after tacrolimus initiation. She did not have improvement with the change to extended-release tacrolimus, the use of everolimus as a calcineurin inhibitor-sparing agent, or the addition of primidone, clonazepam, or propranolol. She underwent magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy with significant improvement in her tremor and activities of daily living.",0
"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to determine whether two neurosurgical procedures, deep brain stimulation (DBS) and focused ultrasound (FUS), to treat essential tremor (ET) of the upper limb also reduce vocal tremor (VT) in patients with comorbid dysphonia. METHODS: Twelve patients with ET and concomitant VT scheduled for neurosurgical intervention (FUS or DBS) or returning for follow-up after DBS implantation were assessed. FUS patients were assessed pre- and post-intervention and DBS patients were assessed with the electrodes turned on and off post-implantation. Three voice recordings of a sustained /a/ were obtained for each participant condition. Percent fundamental frequency variability (FFV) was calculated for each recorded sustained vowel. Additionally, blinded expert perceptual VT rating (VTR) was performed to assess subjective changes in tremors. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients, seven underwent unilateral FUS, and five underwent bilateral DBS. Mean FFV without neurosurgical intervention was 18.3%, SD = 7.8 and with neurosurgical intervention was 6.3%, SD = 3.0 (t (70) =8.7, p < 0.001). Mean FFV decreased in the FUS cohort from 22.0%, SD = 7.1 pre-ablation to 6.7%, SD = 2.4 post-ablation (t (40) = 7.7, p < 0.001). Mean FFV also decreased in the DBS cohort from 15.7%, SD = 7.0 to 6.0%, SD = 3.3 when stimulation was turned on (t (28)=5.7 p < 0.001). In the FUS group, mean VTR decreased from 4.0 to 1.4 post-ablation (Z = 7.8, p < 0.001). In the DBS group, mean VTR decreased from 3.3 to 2.1 with stimulation (Z = 4.1, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical interventions for ET (bilateral DBS and unilateral FUS) demonstrate acoustic and perceptual benefits for VT. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 2023.",0
"Thrombus is one of the culprits for global health problems. However, most current antithrombotic drugs are limited by restricted targeting ability and a high risk of systemic bleeding. A hybrid cell membrane-coated biomimetic nanosystem (PM/RM@PLGA@P/R) was constructed in this paper to fulfil the targeted delivery of ginsenoside (Rg1) and perfluorohexane (PFH). Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) is used as carriers to coat Rg1 and PFH. Thanks to the camouflage of erythrocyte membrane (RM) and platelet membrane (PM), the nanosystem in question possesses remarkable features including immune escape and self-targeting. Therefore, a compact nano-core with PLGA@P/R was formed, with a hybrid membrane covering the surface of the core, forming a ""core-shell"" structure. With its ""core-shell"" structure, this nanoparticle fancifully combines the advantages of both PFH (the low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)-responsive phase-change thrombolysis) and Rg1(the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant abilities). Meanwhile, PM/RM@PLGA@P/R nanoparticles exhibits superior in-vitro performance in terms of ROS scavenging, anticoagulant activity and immune escape compared with those without cell membranes (PLGA@P/R). Furthermore, in the animal experiment in which the tail vein thrombosis model was established by injecting k-carrageenan, the combined treatment of LIFU and PM/RM@PLGA@P/R showed a satisfactory antithrombotic efficiency (88.20 %) and a relatively higher biological safety level. This strategy provides new insights into the development of more effective and safer targeted biomimetic nanomedicines for antithrombotic treatments, possessing potential application in synergistic therapy field.",0
"Morbihan disease is a rare entity involving the upper two-thirds of the face and characterized by chronic erythematous edema, which is recalcitrant to the traditional therapy of rosacea. We report a case of Morbihan disease effectively treated with macro-focused high-intensity focus ultrasound (MF-HIFU). After MF-HIFU treatment, an obvious reduction in swelling was observed with decreased erythema and hyperalgesia. In addition, in-vitro experiments were conducted to measure the actual temperature of the skin tissue under the epidermis. The results of the in-vitro experiments showed that the temperature plateau in the skin sample was reached at approximately 42°C after 5-min treatment or longer. MF-HIFU might be a promising energy-based therapy for Morbihan disease.",0
"Purpose: The application of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was promising. However, whether the effect of HIFU is comparable with that of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has not been determined.Materials and methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, WanFang Data, CqVip, CNKI, and CBM databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies. The methodological quality of each study was evaluated. When there is no statistical heterogeneity, the fixed effect model would be used to merge data. Otherwise, the random effect model would be utilized. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding one study each time. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on age, sex, tumor number, relative number of the patients with Child-Pugh C grade in each group, the percentage of patients with Child-Pugh C grade in the whole study, and tumor load. Publication bias was evaluated by Egger's test and Begg's test.Results: Six cohort studies including 188 patients from HIFU group and 224 patients from TACE group were obtained for further analysis. The meta-analysis suggested HIFU and TACE showed no differences in postoperative 1-year overall survival (OS) rate, tumor response (including complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease), and postoperative complications. Moreover, compared with TACE, HIFU showed higher postoperative 6-month and 2-year OS rates. Subgroup analyses, meta regression analysis and sensitivity analyses indicated the findings above were reliable. Additionally, no potential publication bias was detected.Conclusion: For HCC, when compared with TACE, HIFU might show comparable safety but better effect. Considering the limitations of current studies, more well-designed studies are needed to validate our conclusion.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a novel noninvasive interventional technique for osteoid osteoma (OO). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MRgFUS in the treatment of OO through a systematic review and meta-analysis of pain scores and post-treatment adverse events before and after MRgFUS treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of science, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to screen the study literature based on inclusion and exclusion criteria to extract and analyze pre- and post-treatment pain score data, success rates (complete pain relief with no recurrence until the last follow-up), recurrence rates, secondary intervention rates, and complications to evaluate the efficacy and/or safety of MRgFUS for OO. RESULTS: A total of 113 studies published between 2012 and 2022were collected, resulting in a total sample size of 353 patients. The majority of the studies were prospective and had a follow-up period of 4 weeks or more, and overall, the quality of evidence ranged from low to high. Pain scores at 1 week and 1 month after the merger were 0.62 (9.5% CI:0.28-0.96) and 0.37 (9.5% CI:0.07-0.68), respectively. The success rate of the combination was 92.8% (95% CI: 89.8%-95.7%), the incidence of minor complications (thermal injury at the ablation site) was 0.85%, and no major complications were recorded in any of the included literature. CONCLUSION: MRgFUS is an effective procedure that is able to treat pain for patients with OO with satisfying efficacy and safety. PROSPERO: No.CRD42023415573.",0
"BACKGROUND: Regional differences in gray matter volume (GMV) have been reported to be a reliable marker for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to explore the clinical value of GMV to assess magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy as a treatment for tremor-dominant PD (TDPD). METHODS: Nine TDPD patients with MRgFUS thalamotomy were recruited for structural magnetic resonance image (MRI) scanning and clinical score evaluation. GMV was calculated. To investigate changes after treatment, voxel- and region of interest (ROI)-wise GMV analyses were performed. Then, GMV with significant differences was extracted from patients to investigate its dynamic alterations by one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The nonparametric Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between GMV alterations and tremor improvement after thalamotomy. RESULTS: Tremors were significantly relieved after MRgFUS thalamotomy in nine patients (P<0.05). The treated hand tremor scores improved 74.82% on average in patients from pre-operation to 12 months post-operation. Voxel-wise analysis at the cluster level showed a significant decrease in GMV in the left middle occipital gyrus (MOG) [t=11.81, voxel-level P<0.001, cluster-level Pfamily-wise error (FWE) <0.05] and an increase in GMV in the left precentral gyrus (PreCG) (t=7.99, voxel-level P<0.001, cluster-level PFWE <0.05) in TDPD patients from preoperative to 12 months post-operation, which was significantly correlated with tremor scores (rho =0.346-0.439, P<0.05). ROI-wise analysis showed that GMV related to MRgFUS thalamotomy was associated with long-term structural alterations (P<0.05 with Bonferroni correction), including specific basal ganglia and related nuclei and cerebellum subregions. CONCLUSIONS: GMV can be used to reflect tremor improvement after MRgFUS thalamotomy and be helpful to better understand the distant effect of MRgFUS thalamotomy and the involvement of GMV in tremor control in TDPD.

"BACKGROUND: Tissue preservation strategies have been increasingly used for the management of localized prostate cancer. Focal ablation using ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has demonstrated promising short and medium-term oncological outcomes. Advancements in HIFU therapy such as the introduction of tissue change monitoring (TCM) aim to further improve treatment efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between intraoperative TCM during HIFU focal therapy for localized prostate cancer and oncological outcomes 12 mo afterward. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy consecutive men at a single institution with prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled. Men with prior treatment, metastases, or pelvic radiation were excluded to obtain a final cohort of 55 men. INTERVENTION: All men underwent HIFU focal therapy followed by magnetic resonance (MR)-fusion biopsy 12 mo later. Tissue change was quantified intraoperatively by measuring the backscatter of ultrasound waves during ablation. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Gleason grade group (GG) ≥2 cancer on postablation biopsy was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included GG ≥1 cancer, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores ≥3, and evidence of tissue destruction on post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A Student's t - test analysis was performed to evaluate the mean TCM scores and efficacy of ablation measured by histopathology. Multivariate logistic regression was also performed to identify the odds of residual cancer for each unit increase in the TCM score. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A lower mean TCM score within the region of the tumor (0.70 vs 0.97, p = 0.02) was associated with the presence of persistent GG ≥2 cancer after HIFU treatment. Adjusting for initial prostate-specific antigen, PI-RADS score, Gleason GG, positive cores, and age, each incremental increase of TCM was associated with an 89% reduction in the odds (odds ratio: 0.11, confidence interval: 0.01-0.97) of having residual GG ≥2 cancer on postablation biopsy. Men with higher mean TCM scores (0.99 vs 0.72, p = 0.02) at the time of treatment were less likely to have abnormal MRI (PI-RADS ≥3) at 12 mo postoperatively. Cases with high TCM scores also had greater tissue destruction measured on MRI and fewer visible lesions on postablation MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue change measured using TCM values during focal HIFU of the prostate was associated with histopathology and radiological outcomes 12 mo after the procedure. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we looked at how well ultrasound changes of the prostate during focal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer predict patient outcomes. We found that greater tissue change measured by the HIFU device was associated with less residual cancer at 1 yr. This tool should be used to ensure optimal ablation of the cancer and may improve focal therapy outcomes in the future.",0
"CONTEXT: Whole-gland ablation is a feasible and effective minimally invasive treatment for localized prostate cancer (PCa). Previous systematic reviews supported evidence for favorable functional outcomes, but oncological outcomes were inconclusive owing to limited follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the real-world data on the mid- to long-term oncological and functional outcomes of whole-gland cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in patients with clinically localized PCa, and to provide expert recommendations and commentary on these findings. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library publications through February 2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. As endpoints, baseline clinical characteristics, and oncological and functional outcomes were assessed. To estimate the pooled prevalence of oncological, functional, and toxicity outcomes, and to quantify and explain the heterogeneity, random-effect meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-nine studies were identified, including 14 on cryoablation and 15 on HIFU with a median follow-up of 72 mo. Most of the studies were retrospective (n = 23), with IDEAL (idea, development, exploration, assessment, and long-term study) stage 2b (n = 20) being most common. Biochemical recurrence-free survival, cancer-specific survival, overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and metastasis-free survival rates at 10 yr were 58%, 96%, 63%, 71-79%, and 84%, respectively. Erectile function was preserved in 37% of cases, and overall pad-free continence was achieved in 96% of cases, with a 1-yr rate of 97.4-98.8%. The rates of stricture, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, rectourethral fistula, and sepsis were observed to be 11%, 9.5%, 8%, 0.7%, and 0.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The mid- to long-term real-world data, and the safety profiles of cryoablation and HIFU are sound to support and be offered as primary treatment for appropriate patients with localized PCa. When compared with other existing treatment modalities for PCa, these ablative therapies provide nearly equivalent intermediate- to long-term oncological and toxicity outcomes, as well as excellent pad-free continence rates in the primary setting. This real-world clinical evidence provides long-term oncological and functional outcomes that enhance shared decision-making when balancing risks and expected outcomes that reflect patient preferences and values. PATIENT SUMMARY: Cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound are minimally invasive treatments available to selectively treat localized prostate cancer, considering their nearly comparable intermediate- to long term cancer control and preservation of urinary continence to other radical treatments in the primary setting. However, a well-informed decision should be made based on one's values and preferences.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To report the 5-year failure-free survival (FFS) following high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This observational cohort study used linked National Cancer Registry data, radiotherapy data, administrative hospital data and mortality records of 1381 men treated with HIFU for clinically localised prostate cancer in England. The primary outcome, FFS, was defined as freedom from local salvage treatment and cancer-specific mortality. Secondary outcomes were freedom from repeat HIFU, prostate cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Cox regression was used to determine whether baseline characteristics, including age, treatment year, T stage and International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group were associated with FFS. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up was 37 (20-62) months. The median (IQR) age was 65 (59-70) years and 81% had an ISUP Grade Group of 1-2. The FFS was 96.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 95.4%-97.4%) at 1 year, 86.0% (95% CI 83.7%-87.9%) at 3 years and 77.5% (95% CI 74.4%-80.3%) at 5 years. The 5-year FFS for ISUP Grade Groups 1-5 was 82.9%, 76.6%, 72.2%, 52.3% and 30.8%, respectively (P < 0.001). Freedom from repeat HIFU was 79.1% (95% CI 75.7%-82.1%), CSS was 98.8% (95% CI 97.7%-99.4%) and OS was 95.9% (95% CI 94.2%-97.1%) at 5 years. CONCLUSION: Four in five men were free from local salvage treatment at 5 years but treatment failure varied significantly according to ISUP Grade Group. Patients should be appropriately informed with respect to salvage radical treatment following HIFU.",0
"BACKGROUND: A detailed understanding of the non-perfused volume (NPV) evolution after prostate ablation therapy is lacking. The impact of different diseased prostate tissues on NPV evolution post-ablation is unknown. PURPOSE: To characterize the NPV evolution for three treatment groups undergoing heat-based prostate ablation therapy, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), primary prostate cancer (PCa), and radiorecurrent PCa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study design and data analysis were performed retrospectively. All patients received MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA). 21 BPH, 28 radiorecurrent PCa and 40 primary PCa patients were included. Using the T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MR image, the NPV was manually contoured by an experienced radiologist. All patients received an MRI immediately following the ablation. Follow-up included MRI at 3- and 12 months for BPH and radiorecurrent PCa patients and at 6- and 12 months for primary PCa patients. RESULTS: A significant difference between BPH and radiorecurrent PCa patients was observed at three months (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank sum test), with the median NPV decreasing by 77 % for BPH patients but increasing by 4 % for radiorecurrent PCa patients. At six months, the median NPV decreased by 97 % for primary PCa. Across all groups, although 40 % of patients had residual NPV at 12 months, it tended to be < 1 mL. CONCLUSION: The resolution of necrotic tissue after ablation was markedly slower for irradiated than treatment-naïve prostate tissue. These results may account for the increased toxicity observed after radiorecurrent salvage therapy. By 12 months, most necrotic prostate tissue had disappeared in every treatment group.",0
"INTRODUCTION: Focal therapy (FT) is a promising alternative to whole-gland treatments for Localized Prostate Cancer. Ten different FT modalities have been described in literature. However, FT is not yet recommended by the International Guidelines, due to the lack of robust data on Oncological Outcomes. The objective of our Narrative Review is to evaluate the oncological profile of the available FT modalities and to offer a comprehensive overview of the definitions of Cancer Control for FT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature search was performed on 21st February 2023 using PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA). Articles reporting whole gland-treatments were excluded. All articles reporting oncological outcomes were included. RESULTS: One-hundred-twenty-four studies, reporting data on more than 8000 patients treated with FT, were included. Overall, 40 papers were on High Intensity Focal Ultrasound (HIFU), 24 on Focal Cryotherapy, 13 on Irreversible Electroporation (IRE), 11 on Focal brachytherapy, 10 on Focal Laser Ablation (FLA), 8 on Photo-Dynamic Therapy (PDT), 3 on Microwave ablation, 3 on Robotic Partial Prostatectomy, 2 on bipolar Radio Frequency Ablation (bRFA), 1 on Prostatic Artery Embolization (PAE) and 9 comparative papers. Overall, the Biochemical Recurrence (BCR) rate ranged from 0% (Focal Brachytherapy) to 67.5% (HIFU); the Salvage treatment rate ranged from 1% (IRE) to 54% (HIFU) considering re-treatment with FT and from 0% (Focal Brachytherapy) to 66.7% considering standard Radical Treatments. There is no univocal definition of Cancer Control, however the ""Phoenix criteria"" for BCR were the most commonly used. CONCLUSIONS: FT is a promising alternative treatment for localized prostate cancer in terms of Oncological Outcomes, however there is a wide heterogeneity in the definition of cancer control, the reporting of oncological outcomes and a lack of high-quality clinical trials. Solid comparative studies with standard treatments and an unambiguous consensus on how to describe Cancer Control in the field of Focal Therapy are needed.",0
"Background: Image-guided thermal ablation interventions are novel thermal-based modalities used for the treatment of benign thyroid nodules. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and a Bayesian network meta-analysis, examining studies using thermal ablation interventions in the treatment of benign nodular thyroid disease (PROSPERO CRD42022367680). The primary endpoints included volume reduction rate (VRR), and symptomatic score and cosmetic score improvement. Secondary endpoints included vocal disturbances, laryngeal nerve palsy, hypothyroidism, and nodular regrowth (defined by increased nodular volume of >50% for thermal ablation or new nodules arising in remaining thyroid tissue conventional surgery [CS]). Results: We included 16 studies (3 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 13 comparative case series), describing radiofrequency ablation (RFA), laser ablation (LA), microwave ablation (MWA), high-intensity focus ultrasound (HIFU), and CS, respectively. The review included data from 4112 patients followed for a mean of 11.9 months. Meta-analyses showed no significant differences among RFA, LA, MWA, HIFU, and CS regarding any of the primary endpoints of VRR, symptomatic score, and cosmetic score. In examining the surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) ranking, CS (SUCRA, 98.49), LA (SUCRA, 51.58), and MWA (SUCRA, 57.0) were identified as the three interventions that were most likely to result in the largest VRR, symptomatic and cosmetic score reduction. RFA, relative risk (RR) 0.19 [95% credibility interval (CI): 0.06 to 0.48], LA RR 0.23 [CI: 0.06 to 0.79], and MWA RR 0.25 [CI: 0.09 to 0.60] were associated with the greatest reduction in risk for postintervention vocal complications compared with CS, with RFA (SUCRA, 61.62) being ranked as the highest in safety. RFA RR 0.05 [CI: 0.00 to 0.40] and MWA RR 0.16 [CI: 0.02 to 0.73] were associated with a reduced risk of transient laryngeal nerve injury compared with CS. RFA RR 0.00 [CI: 0.00 to 0.00] and MWA RR 0.00 [CI: 0.00 to 0.03] were associated with a reduced risk of hypothyroidism occurrence compared with CS, with RFA (SUCRA, 99.86) yielding the highest safety ranking. RFA was associated with a reduced risk for nodular regrowth RR 0.09 [CI: 0.00 to 0.85], compared with CS. Conclusion: We have comprehensively reviewed the published literature on the efficacy and safety of thermal ablation modalities for benign thyroid nodules. Important research gaps remain regarding a paucity of both long-term data and high-quality RCTs.",0
"BACKGROUND: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a less invasive option offered for the treatment of large, compressive, benign thyroid nodules. METHODS: Observational studies of more than five participants using HIFU in the management of benign thyroid nodules from 2000 to 2021 were identified using predefined inclusion criteria. The primary outcome was an estimate of the effectiveness of HIFU. RESULTS: Out of 158 studies reviewed, 8 articles were included with 297 patients and 300 nodules. HIFU significantly reduced nodule volume from 1 to 24 months following therapy (weighted mean difference [WMD], 47.68, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 34.13-59.66, p < 0.0001) and achieved favorable success rates (risk ratio [RR], 1.49, 95 % CI, 1.15-1.84, p < 0.001) for 50 % volume reduction. CONCLUSIONS: HIFU appears to be a feasible, safe, and effective treatment modality for patients with benign thyroid nodules. Future research, including randomized controlled trials, is needed to determine therapy optimization, and patient selection to identify the potential role of this new therapy.",0
"BACKGROUND: Accurate preoperative assessment of the efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation for uterine fibroids is essential for good treatment results. The aim of this study was to develop robust radiomics models for predicting the prognosis of HIFU-treated uterine fibroids and to explain the internal predictive process of the model using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). METHODS: This retrospective study included 300 patients with uterine fibroids who received HIFU and were classified as having a favorable or unfavorable prognosis based on the postoperative nonperfusion volume ratio. Patients were divided into a training set (N = 240) and a test set (N = 60). The 1295 radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) scans. After data preprocessing and feature filtering, radiomics models were constructed by extreme gradient boosting and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and the optimal performance was obtained by Bayesian optimization. Finally, the SHAP approach was used to explain the internal prediction process. RESULTS: The models constructed using LightGBM had the best performance, and the AUCs of the T2WI and CE-T1WI models were 87.2 (95% CI = 87.1-87.5) and 84.8 (95% CI = 84.6-85.7), respectively. The use of SHAP technology can help physicians understand the impact of radiomic features on the predicted outcomes of the model from a global and individual perspective. CONCLUSION: Multiparametric radiomic models have shown their robustness in predicting HIFU prognosis. Radiomic features can be a potential source of biomarkers to support preoperative assessment of HIFU treatment and improve the understanding of uterine fibroid heterogeneity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: An interpretable radiomics model can help clinicians to effectively predict the prognosis of HIFU treatment for uterine fibroids. The heterogeneity of fibroids can be characterized by various radiomics features and the application of SHAP can be used to visually explain the prediction process of radiomics models.",0
"OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the overall pregnancy outcomes after uterus-sparing operative treatment in patients with adenomyosis (AD). DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase for literature from January 2000 to January 2022. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We included all studies reporting reproductive outcomes of uterine-sparing surgery for patients with AD with fertility requirements. Surgical treatment was classified as complete excision or incomplete removal of AD and nonexcisional techniques for induction of necrosis in AD. The latter included physically removing the tissue where pathology is present or disrupting the blood flow to the affected area, involving high-intensity focused ultrasound, microwave ablation, radiofrequency ablation, and uterine artery embolization. Two independent researchers performed study selection according to the screening criteria. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: A total of 13 studies with 1319 patients with AD were included in this study, comprising 795 women wishing fertility. Pooled estimates of pregnancy, miscarriage, and live-birth rates after excisional treatment for women attempting to conceive were 40% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29-52), 21% (95% CI, 16-27), and 70% (95% CI, 64-76), respectively, and corresponding rates after nonexcisional treatment were 51% (95% CI, 42-60), 22% (95% CI, 13-34), and 71% (95% CI, 57-83), respectively. The differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Excisional treatment could be a treatment consideration for patients with symptomatic AD and infertility for several years or repeated failure of assisted reproductive technology. Nonexcisional techniques may be considered probably for AD-related infertility.",0
"BabelBrain is an open-source standalone graphic-user-interface application designed for studies of neuromodulation using transcranial-focused ultrasound (FUS). It calculates the transmitted acoustic field in the brain tissue, taking into account the distortion effects caused by the skull barrier. The simulation is prepared using scans from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, if available, computed tomography (CT) and zero-echo time MRI scans. It also calculates the thermal effects based on a given ultrasound regime, such as the total duration of exposure, the duty cycle, and acoustic intensity. The tool is designed to work in tandem with neuronavigation and visualization software, such as 3-DSlicer. It uses image processing to prepare domains for ultrasound simulation and uses the BabelViscoFDTD library for transcranial modeling calculations. BabelBrain supports multiple GPU backends, including Metal, OpenCL, and CUDA, and works on all major operating systems including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This tool is particularly optimized for Apple ARM64 systems, which are common in brain imaging research. The article presents the modeling pipeline used in BabelBrain and a numerical study where different methods of acoustic properties mapping were tested to select the best method that can reproduce the transcranial pressure transmission efficiency reported in the literature.",0
"Focused ultrasound (FUS) peripheral neuromodulation has been linked to nerve displacement caused by the acoustic radiation force; however, the roles of cavitation and temperature accumulation on nerve modulation are less clear, as are the relationships between these three mechanisms of action. Temperature directly changes tissue stiffness and viscosity. Viscoelastic properties have been shown to affect cavitation thresholds in both theoretical and ex vivo models, but the direct effect of temperature on cavitation has not been investigated in vivo. Here, cavitation and tissue displacement were simultaneously mapped in response to baseline tissue temperatures of either 30 °C or 38 °C during sciatic nerve sonication in mice. In each mouse, the sciatic nerve was repeatedly sonicated at 1.1-MHz, 4-MPa peak-negative pressure, 5-ms pulse duration, and either 15- or 30-Hz pulse repetition frequency (PRF) for 10 s at each tissue temperature. Cavitation increased by 1.8-4.5 dB at a tissue temperature of 38 °C compared to 30 °C, as measured both by passive cavitation images and cavitation doses. Tissue displacement also increased by 1.3- [Formula: see text] at baseline temperatures of 38 °C compared to 30 °C. Histological findings indicated small increases in red blood cell extravasation in the 38 °C baseline temperature condition compared to 30 °C at both PRFs. A strong positive correlation was found between the inertial cavitation dose and displacement imaging noise, indicating the potential ability of displacement imaging to simultaneously detect inertial cavitation in vivo. Overall, tissue temperature was found to modulate both in vivo cavitation and tissue displacement, and thus, both tissue temperature and cavitation can be monitored during FUS to ensure both safety and efficiency.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Precise control over the ultrasound field parameters experienced by biological samples during sonication experiments in vitro may be quite challenging. The main goal of this work was to outline an approach to construction of sonication test cells that would minimize the interaction between the test cells and ultrasound. METHODS: Optimal dimensions of the test cell were determined through measurements conducted in a water sonication tank using 3D-printed test objects. The offset of local acoustic intensity variability inside the sonication test cell was set to value of ±50% of the reference value (i.e., local acoustic intensity measured at last axial maximum in the free-field condition). The cytotoxicity of several materials used for 3D printing was determined using the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. RESULTS: The sonication test cells were 3D printed from polylactic acid material, which was not toxic to the cells. Silicone membrane HT-6240, which was used to construct the bottom of the test cell, was found to reduce ultrasound energy minimally. Final ultrasound profiles inside the sonication test cells indicated the desired variability of local acoustic intensity. The cell viability in our sonication test cell was comparable to that of commercial culture plates with bottoms constructed with silicone membrane. CONCLUSION: An approach to construction of sonication test cells minimizing the interaction of the test cell and ultrasound has been outlined.",0
"Applications in chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering require the large-scale manipulation of a wide range of chemicals, samples, and specimens. To achieve maximum efficiency, parallel control of microlitre droplets using automated techniques is essential. Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD), which manipulates droplets using the imbalance of wetting on a substrate, is the most widely employed method. However, EWOD is limited in its capability to make droplets detach from the substrate (jumping), which hinders throughput and device integration. Here, we propose a novel microfluidic system based on focused ultrasound passing through a hydrophobic mesh with droplets resting on top. A phased array dynamically creates foci to manipulate droplets of up to 300 μL. This platform offers a jump height of up to 10 cm, a 27-fold improvement over conventional EWOD systems. In addition, droplets can be merged or split by pushing them against a hydrophobic knife. We demonstrate Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling using our platform, showing its potential for a wide range of chemical experiments. Biofouling in our system was lower than in conventional EWOD, demonstrating its high suitability for biological experiments. Focused ultrasound allows the manipulation of both solid and liquid targets. Our platform provides a foundation for the advancement of micro-robotics, additive manufacturing, and laboratory automation.",0
"Focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy has been widely studied for breast cancer treatment due to its potential as a fully non-invasive method to improve cosmetic and oncologic results. However, real-time imaging and monitoring of the therapeutic ultrasound delivered to the target area remain challenges for precision breast cancer therapy. The main objective of this study is to propose and evaluate a novel intelligence-based thermography (IT) method that can monitor and control FUS treatment using thermal imaging with the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced heat transfer modeling. In the proposed method, a thermal camera is integrated into FUS system for thermal imaging of the breast surface, and an AI model is employed for the inverse analysis of the surface thermal monitoring, thereby estimating the features of the focal region. This paper presents experimental and computational studies conducted to assess the feasibility and efficiency of IT-guided FUS (ITgFUS). Tissue phantoms, designed to mimic the properties of breast tissue, were used in the experiments to investigate detectability and the impact of temperature rise at the focal region on the tissue surface. Additionally, an AI computational analysis employing an artificial neural network (ANN) and FUS simulation was carried out to provide a quantitative estimation of the temperature rise at the focal region. This estimation was based on the observed temperature profile on the breast model's surface. The results proved that the effects of temperature rise at the focused area could be detected by the thermal images acquired with thermography. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the AI analysis of the surface temperature measurement could result in near real-time monitoring of FUS by quantitative estimation of the temporal and spatial temperature rise profiles at the focal region.",0
"This study describes the development of an ultrasound-responsive polymer system that provides on-demand degradation when exposed to high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Diels-Alder cycloadducts were used to crosslink polycaprolactone (PCL) polymers and underwent a retro Diels-Alder reaction when stimulated with HIFU. Two Diels-Alder polymer compositions were explored to evaluate the link between reverse reaction energy barriers and polymer degradation rates. PCL crosslinked with isosorbide was also used as a non-Diels-Alder-based control polymer. An increase of HIFU exposure time and amplitude correlated with an increase of PCL degradation for Diels-Alder-based polymers. Ultrasound imaging during HIFU allowed for real-time visualization of the on-demand degradation through cavitation-based mechanisms. The temperature surrounding the sample was monitored with a thermocouple during HIFU stimulation; a minimal increase in temperature was observed. PCL polymers were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), optical profilometry, and mechanical testing. PCL degradation byproducts were identified by mass spectrometry, and their cytocompatibility was evaluated in vitro. Overall, this study demonstrated that HIFU is an effective image-guided, external stimulus to control the degradation of Diels-Alder-based PCL polymers on-demand.",0
"This study aims to investigate the feasibility of combined segmentation for the separation of lesions from non-ablated regions, which allows surgeons to easily distinguish, measure, and evaluate the lesion area, thereby improving the quality of high-intensity focused-ultrasound (HIFU) surgery used for the non-invasive tumor treatment. Given that the flexible shape of the Gamma mixture model (GΓMM) fits the complex statistical distribution of samples, a method combining the GΓMM and Bayes framework is constructed for the classification of samples to obtain the segmentation result. An appropriate normalization range and parameters can be used to rapidly obtain a good performance of GΓMM segmentation. The performance values of the proposed method under four metrics (Dice score: 85%, Jaccard coefficient: 75%, recall: 86%, and accuracy: 96%) are better than those of conventional approaches including Otsu and Region growing. Furthermore, the statistical result of sample intensity indicates that the finding of the GΓMM is similar to that obtained by the manual method. These results indicate the stability and reliability of the GΓMM combined with the Bayes framework for the segmentation of HIFU lesions in ultrasound images. The experimental results show the possibility of combining the GΓMM with the Bayes framework to segment lesion areas and evaluate the effect of therapeutic ultrasound.",0
"Equations describing acoustic streaming in soft, porous media driven by focused ultrasound are derived based on the assumption that acoustic waves pass through the porous material as if it were homogeneous. From these equations, a model that predicts the time-averaged flow on the macroscopic scale, as well as the advective transport of the trace components, is created. The model is used to perform simulations for different shapes of the focused ultrasound beam. For a given shape, and using the paraxial approximation for the ultrasound, the acoustic streaming is found to be linearly proportional to the applied ultrasound intensity, to the permeability of the porous material and to the attenuation coefficient, and inversely proportional to the liquid viscosity. Results from simulations are compared to a simplified expression stating that the dimensionless volumetric liquid flux is equal to the dimensionless acoustic radiation force. This approximation for the acoustic streaming is found to be reasonable near the beam axis for focused ultrasound beam shapes that are long in the axial direction, compared to their width. Finally, a comparison is made between the model and experimental results on acoustic streaming in a gel, and good agreement is found.",0
"Advancement of new technologies such as laser, focused ultrasound, microwave and radio frequency for thermal therapy of skin tissue has increased numerous challenging situations in medical treatment. In this article, a new meticulous bio-heat transfer model based on memory-dependent derivative with dual-phase-lag has been developed under different thermal conditions such as thermal shock and harmonic-type heating. Laplace transform method is acquired to perceive the analytical consequences. Quantitative results are evaluated for displacement, strain and temperature along with stress distributions in time domain by adopting the technique of inverse Laplace transform. Impacts of the constituents of memory-dependent derivatives-kernel functions along with time-delay parameter are analysed on the studied fields (temperature, displacement, strain and stress) for both thermal conditions separately using computational results. It has been found that the insertion of the memory effect proves itself a unified model, and therefore, this model can better predict temperature field data for thermal treatment processes.",0
"Computational modeling enables researchers to study and understand various complex biological phenomena in anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs), especially nano-sized DDSs (NSDDSs). The combination of NSDDSs and therapeutic ultrasound (TUS), that is, focused ultrasound and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound, has made significant progress in recent years, opening many opportunities for cancer treatment. Multiple parameters require tuning and optimization to develop effective DDSs, such as NSDDSs, in which mathematical modeling can prove advantageous. In silico computational modeling of ultrasound-responsive DDS typically involves a complex framework of acoustic interactions, heat transfer, drug release from nanoparticles, fluid flow, mass transport, and pharmacodynamic governing equations. Owing to the rapid development of computational tools, modeling the different phenomena in multi-scale complex problems involved in drug delivery to tumors has become possible. In the present study, we present an in-depth review of recent advances in the mathematical modeling of TUS-mediated DDSs for cancer treatment. A detailed discussion is also provided on applying these computational models to improve the clinical translation for applications in cancer treatment. This article is categorized under: Nanotechnology Approaches to Biology > Nanoscale Systems in Biology Therapeutic Approaches and Drug Discovery > Nanomedicine for Oncologic Disease.",0
"BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest in using ultrasound for thermal ablation, histotripsy, and thermal or cavitational enhancement of drug delivery for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Ultrasonic and thermal modelling conducted as part of the treatment planning process requires acoustic property values for all constituent tissues, but the literature contains no data for the human pancreas. PURPOSE: This study presents the first acoustic property measurements of human pancreatic samples and provides examples of how these properties impact a broad range of ultrasound therapies. METHODS: Data were collected on human pancreatic tissue samples at physiological temperature from 23 consented patients in cooperation with a hospital pathology laboratory. Propagation of ultrasound over the 2.1-4.5 MHz frequency range through samples of various thicknesses and pathologies was measured using a set of custom-built ultrasonic calipers, with the data processed to estimate sound speed and attenuation. The results were used in acoustic and thermal simulations to illustrate the impacts on extracorporeal ultrasound therapies for mild hyperthermia, thermal ablation, and histotripsy implemented with a CE-marked clinical system operating at 0.96 MHz. RESULTS: The mean sound speed and attenuation coefficient values for human samples were well below the range of values in the literature for non-human pancreata, while the human attenuation power law exponents were substantially higher. The simulated impacts on ultrasound mediated therapies for the pancreas indicated that when using the human data instead of the literature average, there was a 30% reduction in median temperature elevation in the treatment volume for mild hyperthermia and 43% smaller volume within a 60°C contour for thermal ablation, all driven by attenuation. By comparison, impacts on boiling and intrinsic threshold histotripsy were minor, with peak pressures changing by less than 15% (positive) and 1% (negative) as a consequence of the counteracting effects of attenuation and sound speed. CONCLUSION: This study provides the most complete set of speed of sound and attenuation data available for the human pancreas, and it reiterates the importance of acoustic material properties in the planning and conduct of ultrasound-mediated procedures, particularly thermal therapies.",0
"The effects of transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex and its thalamic projection (i.e., ventral posterolateral nucleus) on the generation of electroencephalographic (EEG) responses were evaluated in healthy human volunteers. Stimulation of the unilateral somatosensory circuits corresponding to the non-dominant hand generated EEG evoked potentials across all participants; however, not all perceived stimulation-mediated tactile sensations of the hand. These FUS-evoked EEG potentials (FEP) were observed from both brain hemispheres and shared similarities with somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) from median nerve stimulation. Use of a 0.5 ms pulse duration (PD) sonication given at 70% duty cycle, compared to the use of 1 and 2 ms PD, elicited more distinctive FEP peak features from the hemisphere ipsilateral to sonication. Although several participants reported hearing tones associated with FUS stimulation, the observed FEP were not likely to be confounded by the auditory sensation based on a separate measurement of auditory evoked potentials (AEP) to tonal stimulation (mimicking the same repetition frequency as the FUS stimulation). Off-line changes in resting-state functional connectivity (FC) associated with thalamic stimulation revealed that the FUS stimulation enhanced connectivity in a network of sensorimotor and sensory integration areas, which lasted for at least more than an hour. Clinical neurological evaluations, EEG, and neuroanatomical MRI did not reveal any adverse or unintended effects of sonication, attesting its safety. These results suggest that FUS stimulation may induce long-term neuroplasticity in humans, indicating its neurotherapeutic potential for various neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions.",0
"Administration of focused ultrasounds (US) represents an attractive complement to classical therapies for a wide range of maladies, from cancer to neurological pathologies, as they are non-invasive, easily targeted, their dosage is easy to control, and they involve low risks. Different mechanisms have been proposed for their activity but the direct effect of their interaction with cell membranes is not well understood at the molecular level. This is in part due to the difficulty of designing experiments able to probe the required spatio-temporal resolutions. Here we use Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations at two resolution levels and machine learning (ML) classification tools to shed light on the effects that focused US mechanotherapy methods have over a range of lipid bilayers. Our results indicate that the dynamic-structural response of the membrane models to the mechanical perturbations caused by the sound waves strongly depends on the lipid composition. The analyses performed on the MD trajectories contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of lipid membranes, and to open up a path for the rational design of new therapies for the long list of diseases characterized by specific lipid profiles of pathological membrane cells.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Herein, a user-friendly software platform for 3-dimensional Focused Ultrasound treatment planning based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images is presented. METHODS: The software directly retrieves and loads MRI images. Various design tools can be used on the MRI images to define the treatment area and the sonication parameters. Based on the treatment plan, the software controls the robotic motion and motion pattern of Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) robotic systems to execute the treatment procedure. Real-time treatment monitoring is achieved through MRI images and thermometry. The software's functionality and performance were evaluated in both laboratory and MRI environments. Different treatment plans were designed on MRI images and sonications were executed on agar-based phantoms and polymer films. RESULTS: Magnetic Resonance (MR) thermometry maps were acquired in the agar-based phantoms. An exceptional agreement was observed between the software-planned treatment area and the lesions produced on the polymer films. CONCLUSIONS: The developed software was successfully integrated with the MRI and robotic system controls for performing accurate treatment planning and real-time monitoring during sonications. The software provides an extremely user-friendly interface, while in the future it could be enhanced by providing dynamic modulation of the ultrasonic parameters during the treatment process.",0
"Sonogenetics is preferred for neuroregulation and the treatment of brain diseases due to its noninvasive properties. Ultrasonic stimulation produces thermal and mechanical effects, among others. Since transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) could be activated at 42 °C, it is overexpressed in the M1 region of the mouse motor cortex to sense the change of temperature upon being stimulated by focused ultrasound. Whether the heat generated by ultrasonic stimulation could activate TRPV1 in the M1 region and induce changes in electromyography (EMG) signals collected from the mice's triceps was carefully verified. The position of the focused ultrasound and the temperature of the tissue at the location of the focused position were simulated using COMSOL software and verified via experiments. For Neuro-2a cells with TRPV1 overexpression, 42 °C could activate the TRPV1 and induce calcium influx. For mice with TRPV1 overexpression in the M1 region, tissue temperature of >42 °C in the M1 region induces an increased number of cfos, suggesting that neurons with overexpressed TRPV1 in the M1 region can be activated using focused ultrasound. Furthermore, when the temperature is >42 °C, the peak-to-peak value of the EMG signal for mice with TRPV1 overexpression in the M1 region was higher than that for mice without TRPV1 overexpression. The immunohistochemical results showed that ultrasound was not harmful to the stimulation site. The noninvasive ultrasound stimulation combined with thermosensitive protein TRPV1 overexpressed in neurocytes as sonothermogenetics technology has great potential to be used for the treatment of neurological diseases.",0
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a sophisticated structure whose full functionality is required for maintaining the executive functions of the central nervous system (CNS). Tight control of transport across the barrier means that most drugs, particularly large size, which includes powerful biologicals, cannot reach their targets in the brain. Notwithstanding the remarkable advances in characterizing the cellular nature of the BBB and consequences of BBB dysfunction in pathology (brain metastasis, neurological diseases), it remains challenging to deliver drugs to the CNS. Herein, we outline the basic architecture and key molecular constituents of the BBB. In addition, we review the current status of approaches that are being explored to temporarily open the BBB in order to allow accumulation of therapeutics in the CNS. Undoubtedly, the major concern in field is whether it is possible to open the BBB in a meaningful way without causing negative consequences. In this context, we have also listed few other important key considerations that can improve our understanding about the dynamics of the BBB.",0
"The invasiveness of neuromodulation technologies that require surgical implantation (e.g., electrical and optical stimulation) may limit their clinical application. Thus, alternative technologies that offer similar benefits without surgery are of paramount importance in the field of neuromodulation. Low-intensity ultrasound is an emerging modality for neural stimulation as ultrasound can be focused in deep tissues with millimeter resolution. Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) has already been demonstrated in a wide range of animals and even humans at different sonication frequencies (mostly in the sub-MHz range due to the presence of the skull). This article first provides some fundamental knowledge in ultrasound, and then reviews various examples of successful tFUS experiments in animals and humans using different stimulation patterns, as well as available tFUS technologies for generating, focusing, and steering ultrasound beams in neural tissues. In particular, phased array technologies for the ultrasound stimulation application are discussed with an emphasis on the design, fabrication, and integration of ultrasound transducer arrays as well as the design and development of phased array electronics with beamformer and high-voltage driver circuitry. The challenges in tFUS, such as its underlying mechanism, indirect auditory response, and skull aberration effects, are also discussed.",0
"Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are slow-growing tumors in the central nervous system (CNS). Patients characteristically show the onset of seizures or neurological deficits due to the predominant LGG location in high-functional brain areas. As a molecular hallmark, LGGs display mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes, resulting in an altered cellular energy metabolism and the production of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate. Despite the remarkable progress in improving the extent of resection and adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, LGG remains incurable, and secondary malignant transformation is often observed. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. In recent years, immunotherapeutic strategies have led to tremendous success in various cancer types, but the effect of immunotherapy against glioma has been limited due to several challenges, such as tumor heterogeneity and the immunologically ""cold"" tumor microenvironment. Nevertheless, recent preclinical and clinical findings from immunotherapy trials are encouraging and offer a glimmer of hope for treating IDH-mutant LGG patients. Here, we aim to review the lessons learned from trials involving vaccines, T-cell therapies, and IDH-mutant inhibitors and discuss future approaches to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies in IDH-mutant LGG.",0
"PURPOSE: The study aims to provide insights on the practicality of using single-element transducers for transcranial Focused Ultrasound (tFUS) thermal applications. METHODS: FUS sonications were performed through skull phantoms embedding agar-based tissue mimicking gels using a 1 MHz single-element spherically focused transducer. The skull phantoms were 3D printed with Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) and Resin thermoplastics having the exact skull bone geometry of a healthy volunteer. The temperature field distribution during and after heating was monitored in a 3 T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner using MR thermometry. The effect of the skull's thickness on intracranial heating was investigated. RESULTS: A single FUS sonication at focal acoustic intensities close to 1580 W/cm2 for 60 s in free field heated up the agar phantom to ablative temperatures reaching about 90 °C (baseline of 37 °C). The ABS skull strongly blocked the ultrasonic waves, resulting in zero temperature increase within the phantom. Considerable heating was achieved through the Resin skull, but it remained at hyperthermia levels. Conversely, tFUS through a 1 mm Resin skull showed enhanced ultrasonic penetration and heating, with the focal temperature reaching 70 °C. CONCLUSIONS: The ABS skull demonstrated poorer performance in terms of tFUS compared to the Resin skull owing to its higher ultrasonic attenuation and porosity. The thin Resin phantom of 1 mm thickness provided an efficient acoustic window for delivering tFUS and heating up deep phantom areas. The results of such studies could be particularly useful for accelerating the establishment of a wider range of tFUS applications.",0
"BACKGROUND: Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a novel non-invasive brain stimulation technique with high depth penetrance and spatial resolution. Theta-burst TUS (tbTUS) is a plasticity-inducing protocol which increases motor cortical excitability for up to 30 min following 80s of sonication. While this protocol may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders, the mechanisms of action of TUS remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We conducted the first pharmacological study to examine the mechanisms of TUS in human primary motor cortex. By administering brain-active drugs with known mechanisms of action, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of tbTUS. METHODS: Fourteen healthy subjects participated in a within-subjects randomized, double-blind, cross-over study with five visits. At each visit, one of four study drugs (carbamazepine - Na+ channel blocker, nimodipine - L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, lorazepam - positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor, dextromethorphan - N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist) or placebo was administered in random order, followed by tbTUS. RESULTS: The plasticity effects of tbTUS on motor cortex excitability measured by motor-evoked potential amplitudes elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation were reduced by all study drugs compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: tbTUS may induce NMDA-dependent synaptic plasticity since the effects are blocked by increased GABAA receptor activities and voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels blockers. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that tbTUS induced long-term potentiation-like mechanisms and that TUS involves activation of mechanosensitive Na+ and Ca2+ channels. Alternatively, non-specific pharmacologically induced changes in excitatory/inhibitory balance might have interfered with the effects of tbTUS.",0
"The principle of targeting brain circuits has drawn increasing attention with the growth of brain stimulation treatments such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and focused ultrasound (FUS). Each of these techniques can effectively treat different neuropsychiatric disorders, but treating any given disorder depends on choosing the right treatment target. Here, we propose a three-phase framework for identifying and modulating these targets. There are multiple approaches to identifying a target, including correlative neuroimaging, retrospective optimization based on existing stimulation sites, and lesion localization. These techniques can then be optimized using personalized neuroimaging, physiological monitoring, and engagement of a specific brain state using pharmacological or psychological interventions. Finally, a specific stimulation modality or combination of modalities can be chosen after considering the advantages and tradeoffs of each. While there is preliminary literature to support different components of this framework, there are still many unanswered questions. This presents an opportunity for the future growth of research and clinical care in brain circuit therapeutics.",0
"Diagnostic imaging plays a critical role in healthcare, serving as a fundamental asset for timely diagnosis, disease staging and management as well as for treatment choice, planning, guidance, and follow-up. Among the diagnostic imaging options, ultrasound imaging is uniquely positioned, being a highly cost-effective modality that offers the clinician an unmatched and invaluable level of interaction, enabled by its real-time nature. Ultrasound probes are becoming increasingly compact and portable, with the market demand for low-cost pocket-sized and (in-body) miniaturized devices expanding. At the same time, there is a strong trend towards 3D imaging and the use of high-frame-rate imaging schemes; both accompanied by dramatically increasing data rates that pose a heavy burden on the probe-system communication and subsequent image reconstruction algorithms. With the demand for high-quality image reconstruction and signal extraction from less (e.g unfocused or parallel) transmissions that facilitate fast imaging, and a push towards compact probes, modern ultrasound imaging leans heavily on innovations in powerful digital receive channel processing. Beamforming, the process of mapping received ultrasound echoes to the spatial image domain, naturally lies at the heart of the ultrasound image formation chain. In this chapter on Deep Learning for Ultrasound Beamforming, we discuss why and when deep learning methods can play a compelling role in the digital beamforming pipeline, and then show how these data-driven systems can be leveraged for improved ultrasound image reconstruction.",0
"Machine learning (ML) methods are pervading an increasing number of fields of application because of their capacity to effectively solve a wide variety of challenging problems. The employment of ML techniques in ultrasound imaging applications started several years ago but the scientific interest in this issue has increased exponentially in the last few years. The present work reviews the most recent (2019 onwards) implementations of machine learning techniques for two of the most popular ultrasound imaging fields, medical diagnostics and non-destructive evaluation. The former, which covers the major part of the review, was analyzed by classifying studies according to the human organ investigated and the methodology (e.g., detection, segmentation, and/or classification) adopted, while for the latter, some solutions to the detection/classification of material defects or particular patterns are reported. Finally, the main merits of machine learning that emerged from the study analysis are summarized and discussed.",0
"Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, and its diagnosis requires many medical examinations, including imaging. Ultrasound offers a practical and cost-effective method for prostate imaging due to its real-time availability at the bedside. Nowadays, various Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, including Machine learning (ML) with neural networks, have been developed to make an accurate diagnosis. In PCa diagnosis, there have been many developed models of ML and the model algorithm using ultrasound images shows good accuracy. This study aims to analyse the accuracy of neural network machine learning models in prostate cancer diagnosis using ultrasound images. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO registration number CRD42021277309. Three reviewers independently conduct a literature search in five online databases (MEDLINE, EBSCO, Proquest, Sciencedirect, and Scopus). We screened a total of 132 titles and abstracts that meet our inclusion and exclusion criteria. We included articles published in English, using human subjects, using neural networks machine learning models, and using prostate biopsy as a standard diagnosis. Non relevant studies and review articles were excluded. After screening, we found six articles relevant to our study. Risk of bias analysis was conducted using QUADAS-2 tool. Of the six articles, four articles used Artificial Neural Network (ANN), one article used Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and one article used Deep Learning (DL). All articles suggest a positive result of ultrasound in the diagnosis of prostate cancer with a varied ROC curve of 0.76-0.98. Several factors affect AI accuracy, including the model of AI, mode and type of transrectal sonography, Gleason grading, and PSA level. Although there was only limited and low-moderate quality evidence, we managed to analyse the predominant findings comprehensively. In conclusion, machine learning with neural network models is a potential technology in prostate cancer diagnosis that could provide instant information for further workup with relatively high accuracy above 70% of sensitivity/specificity and above 0.5 of ROC-AUC value. Image-based machine learning models would be helpful for doctors to decide whether or not to perform a prostate biopsy.",0
"Despite the wide availability of ultrasound machines for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance, an inadequate number of expert radiologists performing ultrasounds in remote areas remains a primary barrier for surveillance. We demonstrated feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) to aid in the detection of focal liver lesions (FLLs) during ultrasound. An AI system for FLL detection in ultrasound videos was developed. Data in this study were prospectively collected at a university hospital. We applied a two-step training strategy for developing the AI system by using a large collection of ultrasound snapshot images and frames from full-length ultrasound videos. Detection performance of the AI system was evaluated and then compared to detection performance by 25 physicians including 16 non-radiologist physicians and 9 radiologists. Our dataset contained 446 videos (273 videos with 387 FLLs and 173 videos without FLLs) from 334 patients. The videos yielded 172,035 frames with FLLs and 1,427,595 frames without FLLs for training on the AI system. The AI system achieved an overall detection rate of 89.8% (95%CI: 84.5–95.0) which was significantly higher than that achieved by non-radiologist physicians (29.1%, 95%CI: 21.2–37.0, p < 0.001) and radiologists (70.9%, 95%CI: 63.0–78.8, p < 0.001). Median false positive detection rate by the AI system was 0.7% (IQR: 1.3%). AI system operation speed reached 30–34 frames per second, showing real-time feasibility. A further study to demonstrate whether the AI system can assist operators during ultrasound examinations is warranted.",0
"Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) provide an efficient way to diagnose the presence of diseases such as breast cancer using ultrasound images (USIs). Globally, breast cancer is one of the major causes of increased mortality rates among women. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) models are widely employed in the detection and classification of tumors in USIs. The CAD systems are designed in such a way that they provide recommendations to help radiologists in diagnosing breast tumors and, furthermore, in disease prognosis. The accuracy of the classification process is decided by the quality of images and the radiologist’s experience. The design of Deep Learning (DL) models is found to be effective in the classification of breast cancer. In the current study, an Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Classification (EDLCDS-BCDC) technique was developed using USIs. The proposed EDLCDS-BCDC technique was intended to identify the existence of breast cancer using USIs. In this technique, USIs initially undergo pre-processing through two stages, namely wiener filtering and contrast enhancement. Furthermore, Chaotic Krill Herd Algorithm (CKHA) is applied with Kapur’s entropy (KE) for the image segmentation process. In addition, an ensemble of three deep learning models, VGG-16, VGG-19, and SqueezeNet, is used for feature extraction. Finally, Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model is utilized to classify the images based on whether breast cancer exists or not. A wide range of simulations were carried out on benchmark databases and the extensive results highlight the better outcomes of the proposed EDLCDS-BCDC technique over recent methods. In the literature, there exist plenty of research works focused on the detection and classification of breast cancer. However, only a few works have focused on the classification of breast cancer using ultrasound scan images. Although deep transfer learning models are useful in breast cancer classification, owing to their outstanding performance in a number of applications, image pre-processing and segmentation techniques are essential. In this context, the current study developed a new Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for the diagnosis and classification of breast cancer using ultrasound images. In the study, an optimal multi-level thresholding-based image segmentation technique was designed to identify the tumor-affected regions. The study also developed an ensemble of three deep learning models for feature extraction and an optimal machine learning classifier for breast cancer detection. The study offers a means of assisting radiologists and healthcare professionals in the breast cancer classification process.",0
"Machine learning (ML) involves algorithms learning patterns in large, complex datasets to predict and classify. Algorithms include neural networks (NN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM). ML may generate substantial improvements in neurosurgery. This systematic review assessed the current state of neurosurgical ML applications and the performance of algorithms applied. Our systematic search strategy yielded 6866 results, 70 of which met inclusion criteria. Performance statistics analyzed included area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to model topics across the corpus and to identify keywords within surgical subspecialties. ML applications were heterogeneous. The densest cluster of studies focused on preoperative evaluation, planning, and outcome prediction in spine surgery. The main algorithms applied were NN, LR, and SVM. Input and output features varied widely and were listed to facilitate future research. The accuracy (F(2,19) = 6.56, p < 0.01) and specificity (F(2,16) = 5.57, p < 0.01) of NN, LR, and SVM differed significantly. NN algorithms demonstrated significantly higher accuracy than LR. SVM demonstrated significantly higher specificity than LR. We found no significant difference between NN, LR, and SVM AUC and sensitivity. NLP topic modeling reached maximum coherence at seven topics, which were defined by modeling approach, surgery type, and pathology themes. Keywords captured research foci within surgical domains. ML technology accurately predicts outcomes and facilitates clinical decision-making in neurosurgery. NNs frequently outperformed other algorithms on supervised learning tasks. This study identified gaps in the literature and opportunities for future neurosurgical ML research.",0
"The use of machine learning (ML) approaches to target clinical problems is called to revolutionize clinical decision-making in cardiology. The success of these tools is dependent on the understanding of the intrinsic processes being used during the conventional pathway by which clinicians make decisions. In a parallelism with this pathway, ML can have an impact at four levels: for data acquisition, predominantly by extracting standardized, high-quality information with the smallest possible learning curve; for feature extraction, by discharging healthcare practitioners from performing tedious measurements on raw data; for interpretation, by digesting complex, heterogeneous data in order to augment the understanding of the patient status; and for decision support, by leveraging the previous steps to predict clinical outcomes, response to treatment or to recommend a specific intervention. This paper discusses the state-of-the-art, as well as the current clinical status and challenges associated with the two later tasks of interpretation and decision support, together with the challenges related to the learning process, the auditability/traceability, the system infrastructure and the integration within clinical processes in cardiovascular imaging.",0
"Machine learning-based tools are capable of guiding individualized clinical management and decision-making by providing predictions of a patient’s future health state. Through their ability to model complex nonlinear relationships, ML algorithms can often outperform traditional statistical prediction approaches, but the use of nonlinear functions can mean that ML techniques may also be less interpretable than traditional statistical methodologies. While there are benefits of intrinsic interpretability, many model-agnostic approaches now exist and can provide insight into the way in which ML systems make decisions. In this paper, we describe how different algorithms can be interpreted and introduce some techniques for interpreting complex nonlinear algorithms.",0
"The deployment of machine learning for tasks relevant to complementing standard of care and advancing tools for precision health has gained much attention in the clinical community, thus meriting further investigations into its broader use. In an introduction to predictive modelling using machine learning, we conducted a review of the recent literature that explains standard taxonomies, terminology and central concepts to a broad clinical readership. Articles aimed at readers with little or no prior experience of commonly used methods or typical workflows were summarised and key references are highlighted. Continual interdisciplinary developments in data science, biostatistics and epidemiology also motivated us to further discuss emerging topics in predictive and data-driven (hypothesis-less) analytics with machine learning. Through two methodological deep dives using examples from precision psychiatry and outcome prediction after lymphoma, we highlight how the use of, for example, natural language processing can outperform established clinical risk scores and aid dynamic prediction and adaptive care strategies. Such realistic and detailed examples allow for critical analysis of the importance of new technological advances in artificial intelligence for clinical decision-making. New clinical decision support systems can assist in prevention and care by leveraging precision medicine.",0
"This article discusses the use of High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) as a minimally invasive therapy for the treatment of various pathologies. It proposes an alternative solution of replacing the computationally expensive direct solver with a surrogate model built from a database of simulation results. This procedure and its related tools have been implemented in CIVA-HealthCare and two applications are presented to highlight the potential offered by such intensive HIFU simulation based on surrogate models strategy. The article also discusses the use of a dedicated GUI to simulate 3D pressure fields in biological tissues, as well as the use of a temperature rise and thermal dose computation module to estimate the shape, position, and degree of thermal damage within the tissue. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was performed using a metamodel to study the evolution of the lesion volume according to the variations of three parameters.",1
"This article reviews the use of MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy for essential tremor, a neurological disorder. It discusses the effects of acoustic power, thermal dose, lesion size, and other factors on the efficacy of the procedure. It also examines the correlation between skull metrics and SDR (skull density ratio) to determine the best indicator of treatment parameters. Machine learning algorithms were used to predict maximum power and energy required from the local and overall SDRs. The results suggest that evaluation of alternative skull features may improve prediction of treatment parameters and facilitate patient selection and counseling.",1
"This study aimed to identify the most important features from clinical patient data for high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy outcome classification in uterine fibroids. Data was collected from 66 patients with 89 uterine fibroids treated with Sonalleve V2 (Profound Medical, Mississauga, Canada) therapy system. Results identified the most prominent clinical parameters for HIFU therapy outcome prediction in uterine fibroids, with fibroid diameter and volume being the most important features. The study also examined the effects of GnRH agonist pre-treatment, oxytocin, and T1 perfusion-based classification on the ablation of uterine fibroids. A machine learning model (SVC) was used to take advantage of these features in predicting the treatment outcome.",1
"This article reviews current medical treatments for uterine fibroids, including Uterine Artery Embolization, High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation, and Magnetic Resonance-Guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery. It also examines the use of magnetic resonance imaging parameters and machine learning algorithms to predict the prognosis of high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of uterine fibroids. Results showed that postoperative non-perfused volume and residual fibroid volume were the most important features influencing NPV reduction, while maximum residual fibroid thickness and basal distribution of residual fibroids were the most important features for predicting residual fibroid regrowth. The study also found that younger women were more likely to develop residual fibroid regrowth. The best model for predicting NPV reduction was multilayer perceptron with an R2 of 0.907, and the best model for predicting residual fibroid regrowth was random forest with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.904.",1
"This article discusses the use of machine learning algorithms to model the response of focused ultrasound for non-invasive treatment. A dataset of 19,227 simulations was used to train several machine learning models, with the random forest model providing superior accuracy. This approach could improve the therapeutic planning process by minimizing simulation time. The model was tested using standard statistical performance metrics and found to be most effective with the Random Forest algorithm. The model was further tested using external data points and found to be effective in predicting maximum pressure, power deposition, and temperature rise in the focus during ultrasonic surgery or hyperthermia. The study concluded that the model could be further enriched by adding different tissue properties and transducer geometries.",1
"This paper presents a novel approach to real-time 3D temperature visualization for thermal ablation procedures, such as high intensity focused ultrasound and radiofrequency ablation, using photon-counting computed tomography (CT) and a neural network to predict temperature. The neural network was trained on experimental data and achieved a mean absolute error of 3.97°C and 1.80°C on 300 mmol/L CaCl2 and a milk-based protein shake respectively. This approach is promising for handling non-linear thermal properties for materials similar or dissimilar to the base materials. The article also discusses the use of X-ray thermography for three-dimensional imaging, and provides links to datasets, NIST data, and other research papers related to X-ray photon-counting data correction and EM estimation of X-ray spectrums.",1
"This study investigated the use of radiomics and machine learning to predict the outcome of HIFU ablation of uterine leiomyomas. The ReliefF-SVM model showed favorable predictive performance, with an average accuracy of 0.849, sensitivity of 0.814, specificity of 0.896, positive predictive value of 0.903, negative predictive value of 0.823, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.887. The results showed that the quantitative radiomics features from preoperative MR images could effectively describe the degree of difficulty in HIFU ablation of uterine leiomyomas.",1
"This article discusses an intelligent HIFU therapy system for uterine fibroids, which combines preoperative and intraoperative medical images, noninvasive HIFU therapy, and a real-time image guidance system to provide an automatic and accurate diagnosis and treatment strategy. Experiments have shown that the proposed system is feasible for treating common uterine fibroid cases and can reach the level of operation performed by senior doctors. The system was evaluated for preoperative MR image segmentation accuracy, intraoperative ultrasound lesion tracking accuracy, and clinical experiments. The results showed that the proposed system had better robustness for HIFU ultrasound images and a faster calculation speed than the conventional method.",1
"This study used machine learning algorithms to predict the treatment outcome of uterine fibroids with an immediate NPV ratio of at least 90%. It found that the Ktrans ratio of the fibroid to the myometrium was the highest-ranking feature for predicting the treatment outcome, and that there was a significant negative correlation between the Ktrans of the fibroid and the NPV ratio. The study also looked at the effects of ultrasound-guided high intensity focused ultrasound for single uterine fibroids, the analysis of tissue and arterial blood temperatures in the resting human forearm, the proof and measurement of association between two things, and an introduction to ROC analysis.",1
"This article discusses the use of deep learning methods for automated segmentation of the uterus in MRI scans, enabling objective assessment of therapeutic response to high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy. Two neural networks were trained and compared, a standard 3D U-Net and a modified U-Net using additional convolutional block attention modules (CBAMs) in the encoder. Results showed that the modified version with CBAMs improved the focus on relevant image information and its location. The mean performance of the two models was very similar, with a mean Dice score of 0.95 and a mean relative volume difference of 3.79%. The study also discussed the use of CT angiography to detect aneurysms, deep transfer learning to detect liver cirrhosis, and split-and-merge and multi-seed region growing algorithms for uterine fibroid segmentation in MRgFUS treatments.",1
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a rapidly developing medical technology that allows non-invasive thermal ablation of tumors. Thermal treatment of liver tumor, which is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, is problematic because large blood vessels act as a heat sink. Convective cooling protects the cancer cells from thermal destruction and decreases the necrosed volume. A major objective of the method development is to achieve a virtually complete necrosis of tumors close to major blood vessels and to avoid blood vessel damage and, hence, the needed treatment planning. The present study is aimed at predicting liver tumor temperature during HIFU thermal ablation in a patient-specific liver geometry. The model comprises the nonlinear Westervelt equation and bioheat equations in the liver and blood vessels. The nonlinear hemodynamic equations are also taken into account with the convected cooling and acoustic streaming effects being taken into account. We found from this three-dimensional three-field coupling study that in large blood vessels, both convective cooling and acoustic streaming may change the temperature considerably near the blood vessel. More precisely, acoustic streaming velocity magnitude can be several times larger than the blood vessel velocity. The results presented in the current work can be further used to construct a surgical planning platform.",1
"We propose Gaussian processes (GPs) as a novel nonlinear receiver for digital communication systems. The GPs framework can be used to solve both classification (GPC) and regression (GPR) problems. The minimum mean squared error solution is the expectation of the transmitted symbol given the information at the receiver, which is a nonlinear function of the received symbols for discrete inputs. GPR can be presented as a nonlinear MMSE estimator and thus capable of achieving optimal performance from MMSE viewpoint. Also, the design of digital communication receivers can be viewed as a detection problem, for which GPC is specially suited as it assigns posterior probabilities to each transmitted symbol. We explore the suitability of GPs as nonlinear digital communication receivers. GPs are Bayesian machine learning tools that formulates a likelihood function for its hyperparameters, which can then be set optimally. GPs outperform state-of-the-art nonlinear machine learning approaches that prespecify their hyperparameters or rely on cross validation. We illustrate the advantages of GPs as digital communication receivers for linear and nonlinear channel models for short training sequences and compare them to state-of-the-art nonlinear machine learning tools, such as support vector machines.",0
"The adverse effect of air pollution has always been a problem for human health. The presence of a high level of air pollutants can cause severe illnesses such as emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or asthma. Air quality prediction helps us to undertake practical action plans for controlling air pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) reflects the degree of concentration of pollutants in a locality. The average AQI was calculated for the various cities in China to understand the annual trends. Furthermore, the air quality index has been predicted for ten major cities across China using five different deep learning techniques, namely, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Convolutional Neural Network BiLSTM (CNN-BiLSTM), and Convolutional BiLSTM (Conv1D-BiLSTM). The performance of these models has been compared with a machine learning model, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to discover the most efficient deep learning model. The results suggest that the machine learning model, XGBoost, outperforms the deep learning models. While Conv1D-BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM perform well among the deep learning models in the estimation of the air quality index (AQI), RNN and Bi-GRU are the least performing ones. Thus, both XGBoost and neural network models are capable of capturing the non-linearity present in the dataset with reliable accuracy.",0
"Wireless networks have been widely adopted and introduced in the areas of engineering, manufacturing, weather monitoring, transportation, etc., to collect data to improve the quality of decision making, but issues arise, such as large volumes of data, incomplete and incompatible data sets, and noise data that prevent from realizing the true value and exploiting their full potentials. Machine learning and deep learning methods have been used as powerful tools to perform feature detection/extraction and trend estimation/forecasting in wireless networks applications. Supervised machine learning methods, for example, neural network (NN) [1, 2], convolutional neural network (CNN) [3], and recurrent neural network (RNN) [4], can be exploited in the applications pertinent to prediction and classification, whereas unsupervised machine learning methods such as restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), deep belief network (DBN), deep Boltzmann machine (DBM), auto-encoder (AE), and denoising auto-encoder (DAE) [5] can be utilized for data denoising and model generalization. Furthermore, the reinforcement learning methods, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and deep Q-networks (DQNs) [6], are tools for generative networks and discriminative networks to optimize the contesting process in a zero-sum game framework. These well-developed methods can contribute substantially, to better improve predictions and classifications in the relevant applications, but there are some issues and limitations that require further attention from the research communities.",0
"Informatics paradigms for brain and mental health research have seen significant advances in recent years. These developments can largely be attributed to the emergence of new technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. Data-driven methods have the potential to support mental health care by providing more precise and personalised approaches to detection, diagnosis, and treatment of depression. In particular, precision psychiatry is an emerging field that utilises advanced computational techniques to achieve a more individualised approach to mental health care. This survey provides an overview of the ways in which artificial intelligence is currently being used to support precision psychiatry. Advanced algorithms are being used to support all phases of the treatment cycle. These systems have the potential to identify individuals suffering from mental health conditions, allowing them to receive the care they need and tailor treatments to individual patients who are mostly to benefit. Additionally, unsupervised learning techniques are breaking down existing discrete diagnostic categories and highlighting the vast disease heterogeneity observed within depression diagnoses. Artificial intelligence also provides the opportunity to shift towards evidence-based treatment prescription, moving away from existing methods based on group averages. However, our analysis suggests there are several limitations currently inhibiting the progress of data-driven paradigms in care. Significantly, none of the surveyed articles demonstrate empirically improved patient outcomes over existing methods. Furthermore, greater consideration needs to be given to uncertainty quantification, model validation, constructing interdisciplinary teams of researchers, improved access to diverse data and standardised definitions within the field. Empirical validation of computer algorithms via randomised control trials which demonstrate measurable improvement to patient outcomes are the next step in progressing models to clinical implementation.",0
"Deep learning is the state-of-the-art machine learning approach. The success of deep learning in many pattern recognition applications have brought excitement and high expectations that deep learning, or artificial intelligence (AI), can bring revolutionary changes in health care. Early studies of deep learning applied to lesion detection or classification have reported superior performance compared to those by conventional techniques or even better than radiologists in some tasks. The potential of applying deep-learning-based medical image analysis to computer aided diagnosis (CAD), thus providing decision support to clinicians and improving the accuracy and efficiency of various diagnostic and treatment processes, has spurred new research and development efforts in CAD. Despite the optimism in this new era of machine learning, the development and implementation of CAD or AI tools in clinical practice face many challenges. In this chapter, we will discuss some of these issues and efforts needed to develop robust deeplearning-based CAD tools and integrate these tools into the clinical workflow, thereby advancing towards the goal of providing reliable intelligent aids for patient care.",0
"Transformers have dominated the field of natural language processing and have recently made an impact in the area of computer vision. In the field of medical image analysis, transformers have also been successfully used in to full-stack clinical applications, including image synthesis/reconstruction, registration, segmentation, detection, and diagnosis. This paper aimed to promote awareness of the applications of transformers in medical image analysis. Specifically, we first provided an overview of the core concepts of the attention mechanism built into transformers and other basic components. Second, we reviewed various transformer architectures tailored for medical image applications and discuss their limitations. Within this review, we investigated key challenges including the use of transformers in different learning paradigms, improving model efficiency, and coupling with other techniques. We hope this review would provide a comprehensive picture of transformers to readers with an interest in medical image analysis.",0
"While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.",0
"The classical development of neural networks has primarily focused on learning mappings between finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers’ equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed resolution.",0
"Spurred by advances in processing power, memory, storage, and an unprecedented wealth of data, computers are being asked to tackle increasingly complex learning tasks, often with astonishing success. Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games - tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus, part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome.",0

Proponents of ML extol its ability to deal with large, complex and disparate data, often found within medicine and feel that ML is the future for biomedical research, personalized medicine, computer-aided diagnosis to significantly advance global health care. However, the concepts of ML are unfamiliar to many medical professionals and there is untapped potential in the use of ML as a research tool. In this article, we provide an overview of the theory behind ML, explore the common ML algorithms used in medicine including their pitfalls and discuss the potential future of ML in medicine. artificial intelligence; machine learning; medicine; supervised machine learning; unsupervised machine learning.",0
"Background and Purpose- The prediction of long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients may be useful in treatment decisions. Machine learning techniques are being increasingly adapted for use in the medical field because of their high accuracy. This study investigated the applicability of machine learning techniques to predict long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients. Methods- This was a retrospective study using a prospective cohort that enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score 0, 1, or 2 at 3 months. We developed 3 machine learning models (deep neural network, random forest, and logistic regression) and compared their predictability. To evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning models, we also compared them to the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL) score. Results- A total of 2604 patients were included in this study, and 2043 (78%) of them had favorable outcomes. The area under the curve for the deep neural network model was significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score (0.888 versus 0.839; P<0.001), while the areas under the curves of the random forest (0.857; P=0.136) and logistic regression (0.849; P=0.413) models were not significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score. Using only the 6 variables that are used for the ASTRAL score, the performance of the machine learning models did not significantly differ from that of the ASTRAL score. Conclusions- Machine learning algorithms, particularly the deep neural network, can improve the prediction of long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients.",0
"With the development of modern high-throughput omic measurement platforms, it has become essential for biomedical studies to undertake an integrative (combined) approach to fully utilise these data to gain insights into biological systems. Data from various omics sources such as genetics, proteomics, and metabolomics can be integrated to unravel the intricate working of systems biology using machine learning-based predictive algorithms. Machine learning methods offer novel techniques to integrate and analyse the various omics data enabling the discovery of new biomarkers. These biomarkers have the potential to help in accurate disease prediction, patient stratification and delivery of precision medicine.

It provides insight and recommendations for interdisciplinary professionals who envisage employing machine learning skills in multi-omics studies.",0
"Precision medicine is an emerging approach to clinical research and patient care that focuses on understanding and treating disease by integrating multi-modal or multi-omics data from an individual to make patient-tailored decisions. With the large and complex datasets generated using precision medicine diagnostic approaches, novel techniques to process and understand these complex data were needed. At the same time, computer science has progressed rapidly to develop techniques that enable the storage, processing, and analysis of these complex datasets, a feat that traditional statistics and early computing technologies could not accomplish. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a computer science methodology that aims to identify complex patterns in data that can be used to make predictions or classifications on new unseen data or for advanced exploratory data analysis. Machine learning analysis of precision medicine's multi-modal data allows for broad analysis of large datasets and ultimately a greater understanding of human health and disease. This review focuses on machine learning utilization for precision medicine's ""big data"", in the context of genetics, genomics, and beyond.",0
"The recent deluge of genome-wide technologies for the mapping of the epigenome and resulting data in cancer samples has provided the opportunity for gaining insights into and understanding the roles of epigenetic processes in cancer. However, the complexity, high-dimensionality, sparsity, and noise associated with these data pose challenges for extensive integrative analyses. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are particularly suited for epigenomic data analyses due to their flexibility and ability to learn underlying hidden structures. We will discuss four overlapping but distinct major categories under ML: dimensionality reduction, unsupervised methods, supervised methods, and deep learning (DL). We review the preferred use cases of these algorithms in analyses of cancer epigenomics data with the hope to provide an overview of how ML approaches can be used to explore fundamental questions on the roles of epigenome in cancer biology and medicine.",0
"Background: Recently, there has been a momentous drive to apply advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to diagnostic medicine. The introduction of AI has provided vast new opportunities to improve health care and has introduced a new wave of heightened precision in oncologic pathology. The impact of AI on oncologic pathology has now become apparent, and its use with respect to oral oncology is still in the nascent stage. Discussion: A foundational overview of AI classification systems used in medicine and a review of common terminology used in machine learning and computational pathology will be presented.

"The advancement of precision medicine in medical care has led behind the conventional symptom-driven treatment process by allowing early risk prediction of disease through improved diagnostics and customization of more effective treatments. It is necessary to scrutinize overall patient data alongside broad factors to observe and differentiate between ill and relatively healthy people to take the most appropriate path toward precision medicine, resulting in an improved vision of biological indicators that can signal health changes. Precision and genomic medicine combined with artificial intelligence have the potential to improve patient healthcare. Patients with less common therapeutic responses or unique healthcare demands are using genomic medicine technologies. AI provides insights through advanced computation and inference, enabling the system to reason and learn while enhancing physician decision making. Many cell characteristics, including gene up-regulation, proteins binding to nucleic acids, and splicing, can be measured at high throughput and used as training objectives for predictive models. Researchers can create a new era of effective genomic medicine with the improved availability of a broad range of datasets and modern computer techniques such as machine learning. This review article has elucidated the contributions of ML algorithms in precision and genome medicine.",0
"Machine-learning techniques have led to remarkable advances in data extraction and analysis of medical imaging. Applications of machine learning to breast MRI continue to expand rapidly as increasingly accurate 3D breast and lesion segmentation allows the combination of radiologist-level interpretation (eg, BI-RADS lexicon), data from advanced multiparametric imaging techniques, and patient-level data such as genetic risk markers. Advances in breast MRI feature extraction have led to rapid dataset analysis, which offers promise in large pooled multiinstitutional data analysis. The object of this review is to provide an overview of machine-learning and deep-learning techniques for breast MRI, including supervised and unsupervised methods, anatomic breast segmentation, and lesion segmentation.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) broadly refers to analytical algorithms that iteratively learn from data, allowing computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look. These include a family of operations encompassing several terms like machine learning, cognitive learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning-based methods that can be used to integrate and interpret complex biomedical and healthcare data in scenarios where traditional statistical methods may not be able to perform. In this review article, we discuss the basics of machine learning algorithms and what potential data sources exist; evaluate the need for machine learning; and examine the potential limitations and challenges of implementing machine in the context of cardiovascular medicine. The most promising avenues for AI in medicine are the development of automated risk prediction algorithms which can be used to guide clinical care; use of unsupervised learning techniques to more precisely phenotype complex disease; and the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms to intelligently augment healthcare providers. The utility of a machine learning-based predictive model will depend on factors including data heterogeneity, data depth, data breadth, nature of modelling task, choice of machine learning and feature selection algorithms, and orthogonal evidence. A critical understanding of the strength and limitations of various methods and tasks amenable to machine learning is vital. By leveraging the growing corpus of big data in medicine, we detail pathways by which machine learning may facilitate optimal development of patient-specific models for improving diagnoses, intervention and outcome in cardiovascular medicine.",0
"Machine learning is a branch of computer science and statistics that generates predictive or descriptive models by learning from training data rather than by being rigidly programmed. It has attracted substantial attention for its many applications in medicine, both as a catalyst for research and as a means of improving clinical care across the cycle of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease. These applications include the management of haematological malignancy, in which machine learning has created inroads in pathology, radiology, genomics, and the analysis of electronic health record data. As computational power becomes cheaper and the tools for implementing machine learning become increasingly democratised, it is likely to become increasingly integrated into the research and practice landscape of haematology. As such, machine learning merits understanding and attention from researchers and clinicians alike. This narrative Review describes important concepts in machine learning for unfamiliar readers, details machine learning's current applications in haematological malignancy, and summarises important concepts for clinicians to be aware of when appraising research that uses machine learning.",0
"It is known that changes in the mechanical properties of tissues are associated with the onset and progression of certain diseases. Ultrasound elastography is a technique to characterize tissue stiffness using ultrasound imaging either by measuring tissue strain using quasi-static elastography or natural organ pulsation elastography, or by tracing a propagated shear wave induced by a source or a natural vibration using dynamic elastography. In recent years, deep learning has begun to emerge in ultrasound elastography research. In this review, several common deep learning frameworks in the computer vision community, such as multilayered perceptron, convolutional neural network, and recurrent neural network, are described. Then, recent advances in ultrasound elastography using such deep learning techniques are revisited in terms of algorithm development and clinical diagnosis. Finally, the current challenges and future developments of deep learning in ultrasound elastography are prospected.",0
"Background: This paper provides a systematic review of the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the form of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques in fighting against the effects of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Objective & methods: The objective is to perform a scoping review on AI for COVID-19 using preferred reporting items of systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was performed for relevant studies published from 1 January 2020 till 27 March 2021. Out of 4050 research papers available in reputed publishers, a full-text review of 440 articles was done based on the keywords of AI, COVID-19, ML, forecasting, DL, X-ray, and Computed Tomography (CT). Finally, 52 articles were included in the result synthesis of this paper. As part of the review, different ML regression methods were reviewed first in predicting the number of confirmed and death cases. Secondly, a comprehensive survey was carried out on the use of ML in classifying COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, different datasets on medical imaging were compared in terms of the number of images, number of positive samples and number of classes in the datasets. The different stages of the diagnosis, including preprocessing, segmentation and feature extraction were also reviewed. Fourthly, the performance results of different research papers were compared to evaluate the effectiveness of DL methods on different datasets. Results show that residual neural network (ResNet-18) and densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet 169) exhibit excellent classification accuracy for X-ray images, while DenseNet-201 has the maximum accuracy in classifying CT scan images. This indicates that ML and DL are useful tools in assisting researchers and medical professionals in predicting, screening and detecting COVID-19. Conclusion: Finally, this review highlights the existing challenges, including regulations, noisy data, data privacy, and the lack of reliable large datasets, then provides future research directions in applying AI in managing COVID-19.

"Although ultrasound plays an important role in the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD), image interpretation requires extensive training. High operator variability and limited image quality control of ultrasound images have made the application of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) challenging. This study assessed the effect of integrating computer-extracted measurable features with the convolutional neural network (CNN) on the ultrasound image CAD accuracy of CKD. Ultrasound images from patients who visited Severance Hospital and Gangnam Severance Hospital in South Korea between 2011 and 2018 were used. A Mask regional CNN model was used for organ segmentation and measurable feature extraction. Data on kidney length and kidney-to-liver echogenicity ratio were extracted. The ResNet18 model classified kidney ultrasound images into CKD and non-CKD. Experiments were conducted with and without the input of the measurable feature data. The performance of each model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). A total of 909 patients (mean age, 51.4 ± 19.3 years; 414 [49.5%] men and 495 [54.5%] women) were included in the study. The average AUROC from the model trained using ultrasound images achieved a level of 0.81. Image training with the integration of automatically extracted kidney length and echogenicity features revealed an improved average AUROC of 0.88. This value further increased to 0.91 when the clinical information of underlying diabetes was also included in the model trained with CNN and measurable features. The automated step-wise machine learning-aided model segmented, measured, and classified the kidney ultrasound images with high performance. The integration of computer-extracted measurable features into the machine learning model may improve CKD classification.

"This study was aimed to discuss the feasibility of distinguishing benign and malignant breast tumors under the tomographic ultrasound imaging (TUI) of deep learning algorithm. The deep learning algorithm was used to segment the images, and 120 patients with breast tumor were included in this study, all of whom underwent routine ultrasound examinations. Subsequently, TUI was used to assist in guiding the positioning, and the light scattering tomography system was used to further measure the lesions. A deep learning model was established to process the imaging results, and the pathological test results were undertaken as the gold standard for the efficiency of different imaging methods to diagnose the breast tumors. The results showed that, among 120 patients with breast tumor, 56 were benign lesions and 64 were malignant lesions. The average total amount of hemoglobin (HBT) of malignant lesions was significantly higher than that of benign lesions (P < 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of TUI in the diagnosis of breast cancer were 90.4%, 75.6%, 81.4%, 84.7%, and 80.6%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ultrasound in the diagnosis of breast cancer were 81.7%, 64.9%, 70.5%, 75.9%, and 80.6%, respectively. In addition, for suspected breast malignant lesions, the combined application of ultrasound and tomography can increase the diagnostic specificity to 82.1% and the accuracy to 83.8%. Based on the above results, it was concluded that TUI combined with ultrasound had a significant effect on benign and malignant diagnosis of breast cancer and can significantly improve the specificity and accuracy of diagnosis. It also reflected that deep learning technology had a good auxiliary role in the examination of diseases and was worth the promotion of clinical application.",0
"Biomechanical and clinical gait research observes muscles and tendons in limbs to study their functions and behaviour. Therefore, movements of distinct anatomical landmarks, such as muscle-tendon junctions, are frequently measured. We propose a reliable and time efficient machine-learning approach to track these junctions in ultrasound videos and support clinical biomechanists in gait analysis. In order to facilitate this process, a method based on deep-learning was introduced. We gathered an extensive dataset, covering 3 functional movements, 2 muscles, collected on 123 healthy and 38 impaired subjects with 3 different ultrasound systems, and providing a total of 66864 annotated ultrasound images in our network training. Furthermore, we used data collected across independent laboratories and curated by researchers with varying levels of experience. For the evaluation of our method a diverse test-set was selected that is independently verified by four specialists. We show that our model achieves similar performance scores to the four human specialists in identifying the muscle-tendon junction position. Our method provides time-efficient tracking of muscle-tendon junctions, with prediction times of up to 0.078 seconds per frame (approx. 100 times faster than manual labeling). ",0
"The expanding scale and inherent complexity of biological data have encouraged a growing use of machine learning in biology to build informative and predictive models of the underlying biological processes. All machine learning techniques fit models to data; however, the specific methods are quite varied and can at first glance seem bewildering. In this Review, we aim to provide readers with a gentle introduction to a few key machine learning techniques, including the most recently developed and widely used techniques involving deep neural networks. We describe how different techniques may be suited to specific types of biological data, and also discuss some best practices and points to consider when one is embarking on experiments involving machine learning. Some emerging directions in machine learning methodology are also discussed.",0
"Background: Machine learning (ML) is a growing field in medicine. This narrative review describes the current body of literature on ML for clinical decision support in infectious diseases (ID). Objectives: We aim to inform clinicians about the use of ML for diagnosis, classification, outcome prediction and antimicrobial management in ID. Content: We found 60 unique ML-clinical decision support systems (ML-CDSS) aiming to assist ID clinicians. Overall, 37 (62%) focused on bacterial infections, 10 (17%) on viral infections, nine (15%) on tuberculosis and four (7%) on any kind of infection. Among them, 20 (33%) addressed the diagnosis of infection, 18 (30%) the prediction, early detection or stratification of sepsis, 13 (22%) the prediction of treatment response, four (7%) the prediction of antibiotic resistance, three (5%) the choice of antibiotic regimen and two (3%) the choice of a combination antiretroviral therapy. The ML-CDSS were developed for intensive care units (n = 24, 40%), ID consultation (n = 15, 25%), medical or surgical wards (n = 13, 20%), emergency department (n = 4, 7%), primary care (n = 3, 5%) and antimicrobial stewardship (n = 1, 2%). Fifty-three ML-CDSS (88%) were developed using data from high-income countries and seven (12%) with data from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The evaluation of ML-CDSS was limited to measures of performance (e.g. sensitivity, specificity) for 57 ML-CDSS (95%) and included data in clinical practice for three (5%). Implications: Considering comprehensive patient data from socioeconomically diverse healthcare settings, including primary care and LMICs, may improve the ability of ML-CDSS to suggest decisions adapted to various clinical contexts. Currents gaps identified in the evaluation of ML-CDSS must also be addressed in order to know the potential impact of such tools for clinicians and patients.

"Background: Rapid diagnosing is crucial for controlling malaria. Various studies have aimed at developing machine learning models to diagnose malaria using blood smear images; however, this approach has many limitations. This study developed a machine learning model for malaria diagnosis using patient information. Methods: To construct datasets, we extracted patient information from the PubMed abstracts from 1956 to 2019. We used two datasets: a solely parasitic disease dataset and total dataset by adding information about other diseases. We compared six machine learning models: support vector machine, random forest (RF), multilayered perceptron, AdaBoost, gradient boosting (GB), and CatBoost. In addition, a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to address the data imbalance problem. Results: Concerning the solely parasitic disease dataset, RF was found to be the best model regardless of using SMOTE. Concerning the total dataset, GB was found to be the best. However, after applying SMOTE, RF performed the best. Considering the imbalanced data, nationality was found to be the most important feature in malaria prediction. In case of the balanced data with SMOTE, the most important feature was symptom. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that machine learning techniques can be successfully applied to predict malaria using patient information.

"Electroencephalography (EEG) has been a staple method for identifying certain health conditions in patients since its discovery. Due to the many different types of classifiers available to use, the analysis methods are also equally numerous. In this review, we will be examining specifically machine learning methods that have been developed for EEG analysis with bioengineering applications. We reviewed literature from 1988 to 2018 to capture previous and current classification methods for EEG in multiple applications. From this information, we are able to determine the overall effectiveness of each machine learning method as well as the key characteristics. We have found that all the primary methods used in machine learning have been applied in some form in EEG classification. This ranges from Naive-Bayes to Decision Tree/Random Forest, to Support Vector Machine (SVM). Supervised learning methods are on average of higher accuracy than their unsupervised counterparts. This includes SVM and KNN. While each of the methods individually is limited in their accuracy in their respective applications, there is hope that the combination of methods when implemented properly has a higher overall classification accuracy. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of Machine Learning applications used in EEG analysis. It also gives an overview of each of the methods and general applications that each is best suited to.",0
"Since their inception, biosensors have frequently employed simple regression models to calculate analyte composition based on the biosensor's signal magnitude. Traditionally, bioreceptors provide excellent sensitivity and specificity to the biosensor. Increasingly, however, bioreceptor-free biosensors have been developed for a wide range of applications. Without a bioreceptor, maintaining strong specificity and a low limit of detection have become the major challenge. Machine learning (ML) has been introduced to improve the performance of these biosensors, effectively replacing the bioreceptor with modeling to gain specificity. Here, we present how ML has been used to enhance the performance of these bioreceptor-free biosensors. Particularly, we discuss how ML has been used for imaging, Enose and Etongue, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) biosensors. Notably, principal component analysis (PCA) combined with support vector machine (SVM) and various artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms have shown outstanding performance in a variety of tasks. We anticipate that ML will continue to improve the performance of bioreceptor-free biosensors, especially with the prospects of sharing trained models and cloud computing for mobile computation. To facilitate this, the biosensing community would benefit from increased contributions to open-access data repositories for biosensor data.

"Novel approaches for predicting the outcomes of blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening with focused ultrasound (FUS) and microbubbles are highly desired. This study aims to explore machine learning-based methods for reliably predicting the FUS-induced BBB opening efficacy and safety. Methods: Sixteen female rats were used in this study. An acoustic feedback-controlled FUS system (f0: 0.5MHz) was used for the BBB opening with the infusion of custom-made nanobubbles/Definity. Evans Blue was injected for the BBB opening efficacy verification and the brain tissue was harvested for the safety assessment. Acoustic emissions were recorded, preprocessed and fed into three machine learning models for BBB opening outcomes prediction. Conventional stable and inertial cavitation dose were also calculated. Results: Among the tested machine learning models, a modified Support Vector Data Description (mSVDD) model achieved the best performance in the BBB opening efficacy and safety prediction with an accuracy of 85.0+/-16.6% and 62.5+/-12.8%, respectively. Conventional stable and inertial cavitation dose-based prediction has a prediction accuracy of 80.0% in efficacy and 34.3% in safety, respectively. The mSVDD model trained with the overall bubble response (0-2 MHz) performed better than that trained with the ultra-harmonic bubble response (0.7-0.8 MHz) in both efficacy prediction (85.0+/-16.6% vs 76.0+/-8.0%, p=0.04) and safety prediction (62.5+/-12.8% vs 55.0+/-10.7%, p>0.05). It is also found that the mSVDD model trained with nanobubble data cannot be directly applied to Definity. Conclusion: Our investigations demonstrated that it is feasible to achieve a reliable prediction of FUS-induced BBB opening outcomes with machine learning and acoustic signals from stimulated nanobubbles. This study provided a new approach for the prediction of FUS-BBB opening outcomes with a clinical translation potential.",1
"This study developed an office-based cardiovascular risk calculator using a machine learning (ML) algorithm that utilized a focused carotid ultrasound. The design of this study was divided into three steps. The first step involved collecting 18 office-based biomarkers consisting of six clinical risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and smoking) and 12 carotid ultrasound image-based phenotypes. The second step consisted of the design of an ML-based cardiovascular risk calculator-called “AtheroEdge Composite Risk Score 2.0” (AECRS2.0ML) for risk stratification, considering chronic kidney disease (CKD) as the surrogate endpoint of cardiovascular disease. The last step consisted of comparing AECRS2.0ML against the currently utilized office-based CVD calculators, namely the Framingham risk score (FRS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) risk scores. A cohort of 379 Asian-Indian patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (stage 1 to 5) were recruited for this cross-sectional study. From this retrospective cohort, 758 ultrasound scan images were acquired from the far walls of the left and right common carotid arteries [mean age = 55 ± 10.8 years, 67.28% males, 91.82% diabetic, 86.54% hypertensive, and 83.11% with CKD]. The mean office-based cardiovascular risk estimates using FRS and WHO calculators were 26% and 19%, respectively. AECRS2.0ML demonstrated a better risk stratification ability having a higher area-under-the-curve against FRS and WHO by ~30% (0.871 vs. 0.669) and ~ 20% (0.871 vs. 0.727), respectively. The office-based machine-learning cardiovascular risk-stratification tool (AECRS2.0ML) shows superior performance compared to currently available conventional cardiovascular risk calculators.",1
"Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) constitutes a noninvasive treatment strategy to ablate deep-seated bone metastases. However, limited evidence suggests that, although cytokines are influenced by thermal necrosis, there is still no cytokine threshold for clinical responses. A prediction model to approximate the postablation immune status on the basis of circulating cytokine activation is thus needed. IL-6 and IP-10, which are proinflammatory cytokines, decreased significantly during the acute phase. Wound-healing cytokines such as VEGF and PDGF increased after ablation, but the increase was not statistically significant. In this phase, IL-6, IL-13, IP-10, and eotaxin expression levels diminished the ongoing inflammatory progression in the treated sites. These cytokine changes also correlated with the response rate of primary tumor control after acute periods. The few-shot learning algorithm was applied to test the correlation between cytokine levels and local control (p = 0.036). The best-fitted model included IL-6, IL-13, IP-10, and eotaxin as cytokine parameters from the few-shot selection, and had an accuracy of 85.2%, sensitivity of 88.6%, and AUC of 0.95. The acceptable usage of this model may help predict the acute-phase prognosis of a patient with painful bone metastasis who underwent local MRgFUS. The application of machine learning in bone metastasis is equivalent or better than the current logistic regression.  HIFU",1
"Objectives: To develop and apply magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameter-based machine learning (ML) models to predict non-perfused volume (NPV) reduction and residual regrowth of uterine fibroids after high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation. Methods: MRI data of 573 uterine fibroids in 410 women who underwent HIFU ablation from the Chongqing Haifu Hospital (training set, N = 405) and the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (testing set, N = 168) were retrospectively analyzed. Fourteen MRI parameters were screened for important predictors using the Boruta algorithm. Multiple ML models were constructed to predict NPV reduction and residual fibroid regrowth in a median of 203.0 (interquartile range: 122.5–367.5) days. Furthermore, optimal models were used to plot prognostic prediction curves. Results: Fourteen features, including postoperative NPV, indicated predictive ability for NPV reduction. Based on the 10-fold cross-validation, the best average performance of multilayer perceptron achieved with R2 was 0.907. In the testing set, the best model was linear regression (R2 =0.851). Ten features, including the maximum thickness of residual fibroids, revealed predictive power for residual fibroid regrowth. Random forest model achieved the best performance with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.904 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.869–0.939), which was maintained in the testing set with an AUC of 0.891 (95% CI, 0.850–0.929). Conclusions: ML models based on MRI parameters can be used for prognostic prediction of uterine fibroids after HIFU ablation. They can potentially serve as a new method for learning more about ablated fibroids.",1
"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is gaining rapid clinical acceptance as a treatment modality enabling non-invasive tissue heating and ablation for numerous applications. HIFU treatments are usually carried out in a single session, often as a day case procedure, with the patient either fully conscious, lightly sedated or under light general anaesthesia. A major advantage of HIFU over other thermal ablation techniques is that there is no necessity for the transcutaneous insertion of probes into the target tissue. The high powered focused beams employed are generated from sources placed either outside the body (for treatment of tumours of the liver, kidney, breast, uterus, pancreas and bone) or in the rectum (for treatment of the prostate), and are designed to enable rapid heating of a target tissue volume, while leaving tissue in the ultrasound propagation path relatively unaffected. Given the wide-ranging applicability of HIFU, numerous extra-corporeal, transrectal and interstitial devices have been designed to optimise application-specific treatment delivery. Their principle of operation is described here, alongside an overview of the physical mechanisms governing HIFU propagation and HIFU-induced heating. Present methods of characterising HIFU fields and of quantifying HIFU exposure and its associated effects are also addressed.",1
"Traditionally, surgery has been the only cure for many solid tumours. Technological advances have catalysed a shift from open surgery towards less invasive techniques. Laparoscopic surgery and minimally invasive techniques continue to evolve, but for decades high-intensity focused ultrasound has promised to deliver the ultimate objective — truly non-invasive tumour ablation. Only now, however, with recent improvements in imaging, has this objective finally emerged as a real clinical possibility.",1
"MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) surgery is a noninvasive thermal ablation method that uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for target definition, treatment planning, and closed-loop control of energy deposition. Integrating FUS and MRI as a therapy delivery system allows us to localize, target, and monitor in real time, and thus to ablate targeted tissue without damaging normal structures. This precision makes MRgFUS an attractive alternative to surgical resection or radiation therapy of benign and malignant tumors. Already approved for the treatment of uterine fibroids, MRgFUS is in ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of breast, liver, prostate, and brain cancer and for the palliation of pain in bone metastasis. In addition to thermal ablation, FUS, with or without the use of microbubbles, can temporarily change vascular or cell membrane permeability and release or activate various compounds for targeted drug delivery or gene therapy. A disruptive technology, MRgFUS provides new therapeutic approaches and may cause major changes in patient management and several medical disciplines.",1
"Image-guided focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) effectively combines two technologies, MR imaging or US and FUS, into an image-guided therapy delivery system for noninvasive tumor ablation or the targeted delivery of drugs, both of which can either replace or complement surgery or radiation therapy. Focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) is a noninvasive image-guided therapy and an alternative to surgical interventions. It presents an opportunity to revolutionize cancer therapy and to affect or change drug delivery of therapeutic agents in new focally targeted ways. In this article the background, principles, technical devices, and clinical cancer applications of image-guided FUS are reviewed.",1
"Ultrasonography is a safe, inexpensive and wide-spread diagnostic tool capable of producing real-time non-invasive images without significant biological effects. However, the propagation of higher energy, intensity and frequency ultrasound waves through living tissues can induce thermal, mechanical and chemical effects useful for a variety of therapeutic applications. With the recent development of clinically approved High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) systems, therapeutic ultrasound is now a medical reality. Indeed, HIFU has been used for the thermal ablation of pathological lesions; localized, minimally invasive ultrasound-mediated drug delivery through the transient formation of pores on cell membranes; the temporary disruption of skin and the blood brain barrier; the ultrasound induced break-down of blood clots; and the targeted release of drugs using ultrasound and temperature sensitive drug carriers. This review seeks to engage the pharmaceutical research community by providing an overview on the biological effects of ultrasound as well as highlighting important therapeutic applications, current deficiencies and future directions.",1
"Recent advances in molecular neurooncology provide unique opportunities for targeted molecular-based therapies. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a major limitation to the delivery of tumor-specific therapies directed against aberrant signaling pathways in brain tumors. Given the dismal prognosis of patients with malignant brain tumors, novel strategies that overcome the intrinsic limitations of the BBB are therefore highly desirable. Focused ultrasound BBB disruption is emerging as a novel strategy for enhanced delivery of therapeutic agents into the brain via focal, reversible, and safe BBB disruption. This review examines the potential role and implications of focused ultrasound in molecular neurooncology.",1
"Pulsed focused ultrasound can stimulate the receptor and conductive nerve structures of humans and animals as well as the neurons of the central nervous system of invertebrates. The possibility of a wide practical use of this method in medicine and physiology is considered. For example, the stimulating ability of focused ultrasound is applied to the diagnosis of neurological diseases, to the study of skin and tissue sensitivity in man, to the diagnosis of hearing disorders, and to the introduction of auditory information to the deaf with certain forms of hearing pathology. The factors that affect focused ultrasound as a stimulus for the irritation of nerve structures are discussed.",1
"Background: In this paper an MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) robotic system was developed that can be used for conducting experiments in small animals.The target for this robotic system regarding motion was to move a therapeutic ultrasound transducer in two Cartesian axes. Methods: A single element spherically focused transducer of 3 cm diameter, focusing at 7 cm and operating at 0.4 MHz was used. The positioning device incorporates only MRI compatible materials. The propagation of ultrasound is a bottom to top approach. The 2-D positioning device is controlled by custom-made software and a custom-made electronic system which controls the two piezoelectric motors. Results: The system was tested successfully in agar/silica/evaporated milk phantom for various tasks (robot motion, MR compatibility, and MR thermometry). The robotic system is capable of moving the focused ultrasound transducer to perform MR-guided focused ultrasound experiments in small animals. Conclusions: This system has the potential to be deployed as a cost effective solution for performing experiments in small animals. Keywords: MRI; robot; ultrasound.",1
"Focused ultrasound (FUS) therapies induce therapeutic effects in localized tissues using either temperature elevations or mechanical stresses caused by an ultrasound wave. During an FUS therapy, it is crucial to continuously monitor the position of the FUS beam in order to correct for tissue motion and keep the focus within the target region. Toward the goal of achieving real-time monitoring for FUS therapies, we have developed a method for the real-time visualization of an FUS beam using ultrasonic backscatter. The intensity field of an FUS beam was reconstructed using backscatter from an FUS pulse received by an imaging array and then overlaid onto a B-mode image captured using the same imaging array. The FUS beam visualization allows one to monitor the position and extent of the FUS beam in the context of the surrounding medium. Variations in the scattering properties of the medium were corrected in the FUS beam reconstruction by normalizing based on the echogenicity of the coaligned B-mode image. On average, normalizing by echogenicity reduced the mean square error between FUS beam reconstructions in nonhomogeneous regions of a phantom and baseline homogeneous regions by 21.61. FUS beam visualizations were achieved, using a single diagnostic imaging array as both an FUS source and an imaging probe, in a tissue-mimicking phantom and a rat tumor in vivo with a frame rate of 25-30 frames/s.",1
"Background: Focused transthoracic echocardiography (F-TTE) is an important tool to assess hemodynamically unstable patients in the Emergency Department. Although its scope has been defined by the American College of Emergency Physicians, more research is needed to define an optimal F-TTE training program, including assessment of proficiency. Objective: The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of current standards in post-residency training to reach proficiency in F-TTE. Methods: Fourteen staff Emergency Physicians were enrolled in a standardized teaching curriculum specifically designed to meet the 2008 American College of Emergency Physicians' guidelines for general ultrasound training applied to echocardiography. This training program consisted of 6 h of didactics and 6 h of scanning training, followed by independent scanning over a 5-month period. Acquisition of echocardiographic knowledge was assessed by an online pre- and post-test. At the conclusion of the study, a hands-on skills test assessed the trainees' ability to perform and interpret F-TTE. Results: Ninety percent of trainees passed the written post-test. Two views, the parasternal long and short axis, were easily obtainable, regardless of the level of training or the number of ultrasounds completed. Other views were more difficult to master, but strong trends toward increased competency were evident after 10 h of mixed didactic and scanning training and > 45 ultrasounds. Conclusions: A short, 12-h didactic training in F-TTE provided proficiency in image interpretation and in obtaining adequate images from the parasternal window. More extensive training is needed to master the apical and subcostal windows in a timely manner.",1
"Malignant glioma is a severe primary CNS cancer with a high recurrence and mortality rate. The current strategy of surgical debulking combined with radiation therapy or chemotherapy does not provide good prognosis, tumor progression control, or improved patient survival. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) acts as a major obstacle to chemotherapeutic treatment of brain tumors by severely restricting drug delivery into the brain. Because of their high toxicity, chemotherapeutic drugs cannot be administered at sufficient concentrations by conventional delivery methods to significantly improve long-term survival of patients with brain tumors. Temporal disruption of the BBB by microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound (FUS) exposure can increase CNS-blood permeability, providing a promising new direction to increase the concentration of therapeutic agents in the brain tumor and improve disease control. Under the guidance and monitoring of MR imaging, a brain drug-delivery platform can be developed to control and monitor therapeutic agent distribution and kinetics. The success of FUS BBB disruption in delivering a variety of therapeutic molecules into brain tumors has recently been demonstrated in an animal model. In this paper the authors review a number of critical studies that have demonstrated successful outcomes, including enhancement of the delivery of traditional clinically used chemotherapeutic agents or application of novel nanocarrier designs for actively transporting drugs or extending drug half-lives to significantly improve treatment efficacy in preclinical animal models.",1
"Beyond the implementation of the photoacoustic effect to photoacoustic imaging and laser ultrasonics, this study demonstrates a novel application of the photoacoustic effect for high-precision cavitation treatment of tissue using laser-induced focused ultrasound. The focused ultrasound is generated by pulsed optical excitation of an efficient photoacoustic film coated on a concave surface, and its amplitude is high enough to produce controllable microcavitation within the focal region (lateral focus <100 µm). Such microcavitation is used to cut or ablate soft tissue in a highly precise manner. This work demonstrates precise cutting of tissue-mimicking gels as well as accurate ablation of gels and animal eye tissues. Keywords: laser ultrasound; microcavitation; tissue cutting.",1
"This study demonstrates the feasibility of using focused ultrasound (FUS) to modulate glomerular ultrafiltration by renal artery sonication and determine if protein-creatinine ratios are estimated through vascular parameters. All animal experiments were approved by our Animal Care and Use Committee. The renal arteries of Sprague-Dawley rats were surgically exposed and sonicated at various acoustic power levels using a FUS transducer with a resonant frequency of 1 MHz. The mean peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the blood flow was measured by Doppler ultrasound imaging. Urinary protein-creatinine ratios were calculated during the experiments. Histological examination of renal arteries and whole kidneys was performed. The PSV, pulsatility index, and resistance index of blood flow significantly increased in the arteries after FUS sonication without microbubbles (p<0.05). The change in normalized protein-creatinine ratios significantly increased with increasing acoustic power, but such was not observed when microbubbles were administered. Furthermore, no histological changes were observed in the hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections. Glomerular ultrafiltration is regulated temporarily by renal artery sonication without microbubbles. Monitoring vascular parameters are useful in estimating the normalized change in protein-creatinine ratios.",1
"Acoustic cavitation can occur in therapeutic applications of high-amplitude focused ultrasound. Studying acoustic cavitation has been challenging, because the onset of nucleation is unpredictable. We hypothesized that acoustic cavitation can be forced to occur at a specific location using a laser to nucleate a microcavity in a pre-established ultrasound field. In this paper we describe a scientific instrument that is dedicated to this outcome, combining a focused ultrasound transducer with a pulsed laser. We present high-speed photographic observations of laser-induced cavitation and laser-nucleated acoustic cavitation, at frame rates of 0.5×10(6) frames per second, from laser pulses of energy above and below the optical breakdown threshold, respectively. Acoustic recordings demonstrated inertial cavitation can be controllably introduced to the ultrasound focus. This technique will contribute to the understanding of cavitation evolution in focused ultrasound including for potential therapeutic applications.",1
"Objective: To explore the antitumor effects of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) mediated localized drug delivery of adriamycin-microbubble-PLGA nanoparticle complexes on rabbits VX2 liver tumor. Methods: ADM-NMCs were prepared by covalent linking of ADM-PLGA nanoparticles (ADM-NPs) to the shell of the microbubbles. A fixed water bag filled with microbubbles was subjected to LIFU and non-focused ultrasound respectively, and the ultrasound images of which were recorded before and after ultrasonication. A total of 54 VX2 liver tumor-burdened rabbits were divided into six groups randomly, including control, ADM-NPs combined with LIFU, microbubbles combined with LIFU, ADM-NPs and microbubbles combined with LIFU, ADM-NMCs combined with LIFU and ADM-NMCs combined with Non-FUS. The tumor volume and volume inhibition rate (VIR) of tumor progression were calculated and compared. Apoptotic cells were labeled by terminal deoxyuridine nick end. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry. The median survival time of the animals were recorded and compared. Results: ADM-NMCs were successfully prepared with an average diameter of 1721 nm. The highest VIR and apoptotic index (AI) were found in the group of ADM-NMCs combined with LIFU while the lowest proliferating index (PI) was simultaneously observed in this group. The median survival time of the rabbits in the ADM-NMCs combined with LIFU group was the longest (71days) among all groups. Conclusions: ADM-NMCs combined with LIFU could inhibit the rabbits VX2 liver tumor progress by delaying the tumor proliferation and accelerating apoptosis, which presents a novel process for liver tumor targeting chemotherapy. Keywords: ADM-NMCs; LIFU; PLGA nanoparticles; VX2 Liver cancer; microbubble.",1
"Transcranial ultrasound can alter brain function transiently and nondestructively, offering a new tool to study brain function now and inform future therapies. Previous research on neuromodulation implemented pulsed low-frequency (250-700 kHz) ultrasound with spatial peak temporal average intensities (ISPTA) of 0.1-10 W/cm(2). That work used transducers that either insonified relatively large volumes of mouse brain (several mL) with relatively low-frequency ultrasound and produced bilateral motor responses, or relatively small volumes of brain (on the order of 0.06 mL) with relatively high-frequency ultrasound that produced unilateral motor responses. This study seeks to increase anatomical specificity to neuromodulation with modulated focused ultrasound (mFU). Here, 'modulated' means modifying a focused 2-MHz carrier signal dynamically with a 500-kHz signal as in vibro-acoustography, thereby creating a low-frequency but small volume (approximately 0.015 mL) source of neuromodulation. Application of transcranial mFU to lightly anesthetized mice produced various motor movements with high spatial selectivity (on the order of 1 mm) that scaled with the temporal average ultrasound intensity. Alone, mFU and focused ultrasound (FUS) each induced motor activity, including unilateral motions, though anatomical location and type of motion varied. Future work should include larger animal models to determine the relative efficacy of mFU versus FUS. Other studies should determine the biophysical processes through which they act. Also of interest is exploration of the potential research and clinical applications for targeted, transcranial neuromodulation created by modulated focused ultrasound, especially mFU's ability to produce compact sources of ultrasound at the very low frequencies (10-100s of Hertz) that are commensurate with the natural frequencies of the brain.",1
"Microbubble ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) were recently approved by the Food and Drug administration for non-cardiac imaging. The physical principles of UCAs, methods of administration, dosage, adverse effects, and imaging techniques both current and future are described. UCAs consist of microbubbles in suspension which strongly interact with the ultrasound beam and are readily detectable by ultrasound imaging systems. They are confined to the blood pool when administered intravenously, unlike iodinated and gadolinium contrast agents. UCAs have a proven safety record based on over two decades of use, during which they have been used in echocardiography in the U.S. and for non-cardiac imaging in the rest of the world. Adverse effects are less common with UCAs than CT/MR contrast agents. Compared to CT and MR, contrast-enhanced ultrasound has the advantages of real-time imaging, portability, and reduced susceptibility to metal and motion artifact. UCAs are not nephrotoxic and can be used in renal failure. High acoustic amplitudes can cause microbubbles to fragment in a manner that can result in short-term increases in capillary permeability or capillary rupture. These bioeffects can be beneficial and have been used to enhance drug delivery under appropriate conditions. Imaging with a mechanical index of < 0.4 preserves the microbubbles and is not typically associated with substantial bioeffects. Molecularly targeted ultrasound contrast agents are created by conjugating the microbubble shell with a peptide, antibody, or other ligand designed to target an endothelial biomarker associated with tumor angiogenesis or inflammation. These microbubbles then accumulate in the microvasculature at target sites where they can be imaged. Ultrasound contrast agents are a valuable addition to the diagnostic imaging toolkit. They will facilitate cross-sectional abdominal imaging in situations where contrast-enhanced CT and MR are contraindicated or impractical.",0
"Ultrasound imaging is regarded as a highly sensitive imaging modality used in routine clinical examinations. Over the last several decades, ultrasound contrast agents have been widely applied in ultrasound molecular cancer imaging to improve the detection, characterization, and quantification of tumors. To date, a few new potential preclinical and clinical applications regarding ultrasound molecular cancer imaging are being investigated. This review presents an overview of the various kinds of ultrasound contrast agents employed in ultrasound molecular imaging and advanced imaging techniques using these contrast agents. Additionally, we discuss the recent enormous development of ultrasound contrast agents in the relevant preclinical and clinical applications, highlight the recent challenges which need to be overcome to accelerate the clinical translation, and discuss the future perspective of ultrasound molecular cancer imaging using various contrast agents. As a highly promising and valuable tumor-specific imaging technique, it is believed that ultrasound molecular imaging will pave an accurate and efficient way for cancer diagnosis.",0
"The role of ultrasound imaging in the diagnosis and monitoring of paediatric rheumatic diseases with special emphasis on recent scientific work regarding the evidence base and standardization of this technique is being reviewed. An overview of the most important practical aspects for the use of musculoskeletal ultrasound in a clinical setting is also provided. Huge scientific efforts and advances in recent years illustrate the increasing importance of musculoskeletal ultrasound in pediatric rheumatology. Several studies focused on setting an evidence-based standard for the ultrasound appearance of healthy and normal joints in children of all age groups. Physiologic vascularization and ossification were two main aspects of these studies. Other publications demonstrate that ultrasound imaging is also an important and useful tool to detect pathology as synovitis, tenosynovitis or enthesitis in children and to monitor pediatric patients with rheumatic conditions. Important practical aspects include training in the use of correct ultrasound techniques, as well as knowledge and experience of normal pediatric sonoanatomy and the appearance of pathological findings on ultrasound.",0
"As a well-known medical imaging methodology, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging plays a critical role in diagnosis, treatment guidance and post-treatment assessment of coronary artery diseases. By cannulating a miniature ultrasound transducer mounted catheter into an artery, the vessel lumen opening, vessel wall morphology and other associated blood and vessel properties can be precisely assessed in IVUS imaging. Ultrasound transducer, as the key component of an IVUS system, is critical in determining the IVUS imaging performance. In recent years, a wide range of achievements in ultrasound transducers have been reported for IVUS imaging applications. Herein, a comprehensive review is given on recent advances in ultrasound transducers for IVUS imaging. Firstly, a fundamental understanding of IVUS imaging principle, evaluation parameters and IVUS catheter are summarized. Secondly, three different types of ultrasound transducers (piezoelectric ultrasound transducer, piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer and capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducer) for IVUS imaging are presented. Particularly, the recent advances in piezoelectric ultrasound transducer for IVUS imaging are extensively examined according to their different working mechanisms, configurations and materials adopted. Thirdly, IVUS-based multimodality intravascular imaging of atherosclerotic plaque is discussed. Finally, summary and perspectives on the future studies are highlighted for IVUS imaging applications.",0
"Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice for the initial evaluation of disorders that involve the abdominal aorta (AA). The diagnostic value of ultrasound resides in its ability to allow assessment of the anatomy and structure of the AA using two- dimensional, three-dimensional, and contrast-enhanced imaging. Moreover, ultrasound permits evaluation of the physiologic and hemodynamic consequences of abnormalities through Doppler interrogation of blood flow, thus enabling the identification and quantification of disorders within the AA and beyond its boundaries. The approach to ultrasound imaging of the AA varies, depending on the purpose of the study and whether it is performed in a radiology or vascular laboratory or in an echocardiography laboratory. The aim of this review is to demonstrate the usefulness of ultrasound imaging for the detection and evaluation of disorders that involve the AA, detail the abnormalities that are detected or further assessed, and outline its value for echocardiographers, sonographers, and radiologists.",0
"Thyroid nodule is a common and frequently occurring disease in the neck in recent years, and ultrasound has become the preferred imaging diagnosis method for thyroid nodule due to its advantages of noninvasive, nonradiation, real-time, and repeatable. The thyroid imaging, reporting and data system (TI-RADS) classification standard scores suspicious nodules that are difficult to determine benign and malignant as grade 4, and further pathological puncture is recommended clinically, which may lead to a large number of unnecessary biopsies and operations. Including conventional ultrasound, ACR TI-RADS, shear wave elastography, super microvascular imaging, contrast enhanced ultrasound, ""firefly,"" artificial intelligence, and multimodal ultrasound imaging used in combination. In order to identify the most clinically significant malignant tumors when reducing invasive operations. This article reviews the application and research progress of multimodal ultrasound imaging in the diagnosis of TI-RADS 4 thyroid nodules.",0
"Ultrasound-guided breast biopsies can be challenging to perform, especially when the target is adjacent to the nipple, skin, or implant or when the target is small and in very posterior, dense fibroglandular tissue. Oftentimes, a slightly modified approach can result in a diagnostic biopsy specimen with minimal complications. After a brief review of basic techniques for ultrasound-guided breast biopsies that includes a review of conventional breast biopsy devices, a presentation of procedural modifications and techniques to consider for more challenging cases is described. In particular, novel open-trough and tandem-needle techniques are detailed. Several cases using these techniques are then presented.",0
"Ultrasound guidance is valuable for performing precise joint interventions. Joint interventions may be requested for therapeutic and diagnostic pain injections, joint aspiration in the setting of suspected infection, or contrast injection for arthrography. In practice, interventions of the shoulder girdle, elbow, and hand/wrist joints may be performed without any imaging guidance. However, imaging guidance results in more accurate interventions and better patient outcomes than those performed by palpation alone. When compared to other modalities used for imaging guidance, ultrasound has many potential advantages. Radiologists should be prepared to perform ultrasound-guided upper extremity joint interventions utilizing recommended techniques to optimize clinical practice and patient outcomes. KEY POINTS: 1. Ultrasound-guided injections of the glenohumeral, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, elbow, and hand/wrist joints have higher accuracy than injections performed without imaging guidance. 2. Ultrasound-guided aspirations of upper extremity joints have advantages to fluoroscopic-guided aspirations because of the potential to identify effusions, soft tissue abscess, or bursitis. 3. Ultrasound-guided contrast injection prior to MR arthrography is as accurate as fluoroscopic-guided injection for upper extremity joints.",0
"Current standard technique for venous pressure measurement is still invasive, requiring insertion of a catheter. Additionally, clinical estimation of central venous pressure (CVP) has proven unreliable compared to invasive methods. Meanwhile, different non-invasive ultrasound guided modalities may provide a valid alternative to invasive venous pressure measurement. Particularly promising is a novel compression ultrasound (CUS) which combines ultrasound properties with a tissue pressure manometer enabling even further future applications. This review provides an overview using ultrasound guided non-invasive venous pressure measurement (UGPni) in clinical trials so far and focuses on three objectives: (1) To summarize the main methods using UGPni for central venous pressure measurement (2) To outline the key findings of previous clinical trials for UGPni regarding CVP measurement with primary focus on novel compression ultrasound of a forearm vein (3) To point out limitations and possible future clinical implications of these ultrasound modalities UGPni represents an easy-to-perform and safe alternative to invasive ""gold standard"" diagnostic tools for measuring central venous pressure. After a brief introduction, non-specialist personnel using a portable ultrasound device can apply this method in a feasible way. Of all mentioned methods in this review CUS is the method of choice underscoring its ability to assess a patient's CVP categories correctly. Furthermore, detection of non-invasive central venous pressure in the emergency room represents an independent predictor for cardiac rehospitalization in patients with decompensated heart failure, thus helping in risk stratification as well as being an additive tool in general hemodynamic management of critically ill patients. This review concludes a significant role for ultrasound guided non-invasive venous pressure measurement suitable for a wide range of everyday clinical practice. However, further studies are warranted to proof a causal relationship in this regard.",0
"Although ultrasonography is an important cost-effective imaging modality, technical improvements are needed before its full potential is realized for accurate and reproducible monitoring of carotid disease and plaque burden. 2D viewing of 3D anatomy, using conventional ultrasonography limits our ability to quantify and visualize carotid disease and is partly responsible for the reported variability in diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Efforts of investigators have focused on overcoming these deficiencies by developing 3D ultrasound imaging techniques that are capable of acquiring B-mode, color Doppler and power Doppler images of the carotid arteries using existing conventional ultrasound systems, reconstructing the information into 3D images, and then allowing interactive viewing of the 3D images on inexpensive desktop computers. In addition, the availability of 3D ultrasound images of the carotid arteries has allowed the development of techniques to quantify plaque volume and surface morphology as well as allowing registration with other 3D imaging modalities. This paper describes 3D ultrasound imaging techniques used to image the carotid arteries and summarizes some of the developments aimed at quantifying plaque volume and morphology.",0
"Focused ultrasound (FUS/HIFU) relies on ablation of pathological tissues by delivering a sufficiently high level of acoustic energy in situ of the human body. Magnetic Resonance guided FUS (MRgFUS/HIFU) and Ultrasound guided (USgFUS/HIFU) are image guided techniques combined with therapeutic FUS for monitoring purposes. The principles and technologies of FUS/HiFU are described in this paper including the basics of MR guidance techniques and MR temperature mapping. Clinical applications of FUS/HIFU gained CE and FDA approvals for the treatment of various benign and few malignant lesions in the last two decades. Current technical limitations of ultrasound guided and MRI guided Focused Ultrasound, as well as adverse effects for the application of this technique are outlined including challenges of ablating moving organs (liver and kidney). An outlook to possible applications is provided; exampling clinical trials discussing future options.",1
"Shock wave lithotripsy has generally been a first choice for kidney stone removal. The shock wave lithotripter uses an order of microsecond pulse durations and up to a 100 MPa pressure spike triggered at approximately 0.5-2 Hz to fragment kidney stones through mechanical mechanisms. One important mechanism is cavitation. We proposed an alternative type of lithotripsy method that maximizes cavitation activity to disintegrate kidney stones using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Here we outline the method according to the previously published literature (Matsumoto et al., Dynamics of bubble cloud in focused ultrasound. Proceedings of the second international symposium on therapeutic ultrasound, pp 290-299, 2002; Ikeda et al., Ultrasound Med Biol 32:1383-1397, 2006; Yoshizawa et al., Med Biol Eng Comput 47:851-860, 2009; Koizumi et al., A control framework for the non-invasive ultrasound the ragnostic system. Proceedings of 2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robotics and Systems (IROS), pp 4511-4516, 2009; Koizumi et al., IEEE Trans Robot 25:522-538, 2009). Cavitation activity is highly unpredictable; thus, a precise control system is needed. The proposed method comprises three steps of control in kidney stone treatment. The first step is control of localized high pressure fluctuation on the stone. The second step is monitoring of cavitation activity and giving feedback on the optimized ultrasound conditions. The third step is stone tracking and precise ultrasound focusing on the stone. For the high pressure control we designed a two-frequency wave (cavitation control (C-C) waveform); a high frequency ultrasound pulse (1-4 MHz) to create a cavitation cloud, and a low frequency trailing pulse (0.5 MHz) following the high frequency pulse to force the cloud into collapse. High speed photography showed cavitation collapse on a kidney stone and shock wave emission from the cloud. We also conducted in-vitro erosion tests of model and natural kidney stones. For the model stones, the erosion rate of the C-C waveform showed a distinct advantage with the combined high and low frequency waves over either wave alone. For optimization of the high frequency ultrasound intensity, we investigated the relationship between subharmonic emission from cavitation bubbles and stone erosion volume. For stone tracking we have also developed a non-invasive ultrasound theragnostic system (NIUTS) that compensates for kidney motion. Natural stones were eroded and most of the resulting fragments were less than 1 mm in diameter. The small fragments were small enough to pass through the urethra. The results demonstrate that, with the precise control of cavitation activity, focused ultrasound has the potential to be used to develop a less invasive and more controllable lithotripsy system.",1
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is emerging as an effective and promising treatment modality for the formation of coagulative necrosis inside the cancer/tumor noninvasively. To guarantee the efficacy and efficiency of HIFU ablation, the temperature field and consequent thermal dose should be monitored accurately in a high temporal and spatial resolution in real time. However, because of the significant variations of the tissue properties and deep penetration of HIFU beam, especially in the abdominal application, noninvasive thermometry is a very challenging topic, which may hamper the wide acceptance of HIFU by physicians worldwide. In this article, currently available thermometry techniques are reviewed, and their translation from hyperthermia range to the higher temperature for irreversible lesion production is discussed. With the technology improvement and/or development of new approaches, the performance of noninvasive thermometry may meet the clinical requirements.",1
"The tremendous progress in engineering and computing power coupled with ultrasound transducer technology and imaging modalities over the past 20 years have encouraged a revival of clinical interest in ultrasound therapy, mainly in High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). So far, the most extensive results from HIFU obtained in urology involve transrectal prostate ablation, which appears to be an effective therapeutic alternative for patients with malignant prostate tumors. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men. Several treatment options with different therapeutic approaches exist, including HIFU for localized PCa that has been in use for over 15 years. Since the early 2000s, two systems have been marketed for this application, and other devices are currently in clinical trials. HIFU treatment can be used either alone or in combination with (before- or after-) external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (before or after HIFU) and can be repeated multiple times. HIFU treatment is performed under real-time monitoring with ultrasound or guided by MRI. Two indications are validated today: Primary care treatment and EBRT failure. The results of HIFU for primary care treatment are similar to standard conformal EBRT, even though no randomized comparative studies have been performed and no 10-year follow up data is yet available for HIFU. Salvage HIFU after EBRT failure is increasing with oncological outcomes, similar to those achieved with surgery but with the advantage of fewer adverse effects. HIFU is an evolving technology perfectly adapted for focal treatment. Thus, HIFU focal therapy is another pathway that must be explored when considering the accuracy and reliability for PCa mapping techniques. HIFU would be particularly suited for such a therapy since it is clear that HIFU outcomes and toxicity are relative to the volume of prostate treated.",1
"To make full use of the ability of magnetic resonance (MR) to guide high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment, effort has been made to improve techniques for thermometry, motion tracking, and sound beam visualization. For monitoring rapid temperature elevation with proton resonance frequency (PRF) shift, data acquisition and processing can be accelerated with parallel imaging and/or sparse sampling in conjunction with appropriate signal processing methods. Thermometry should be robust against tissue motion, motion-induced magnetic field variation, and susceptibility change. Thus, multibaseline, referenceless, or hybrid techniques have become important. In cases with adipose or bony tissues, for which PRF shift cannot be used, thermometry with relaxation times or signal intensity may be utilized. Motion tracking is crucial not only for thermometry but also for targeting the focus of an ultrasound in moving organs such as the liver, kidney, or heart. Various techniques for motion tracking, such as those based on an anatomical image atlas with optical-flow displacement detection, a navigator echo to seize the diaphragm position, and/or rapid imaging to track vessel positions, have been proposed. Techniques for avoiding the ribcage and near-field heating have also been examined. MR acoustic radiation force imaging (MR-ARFI) is an alternative to thermometry that can identify the location and shape of the focal spot and sound beam path. This technique could be useful for treating heterogeneous tissue regions or performing transcranial therapy. All of these developments, which will be discussed further in this review, expand the applicability of HIFU treatments to a variety of clinical targets while maintaining safety and precision.",1
"Various kinds of image-guided techniques have been successfully applied in the last years for the treatment of tumours, as alternative to surgical resection. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a novel, totally non-invasive, image-guided technique that allows for achieving tissue destruction with the application of focused ultrasound at high intensity. This technique has been successfully applied for the treatment of a large variety of diseases, including oncological and non-oncological diseases. One of the most fascinating aspects of image-guided ablations, and particularly of HIFU, is the reported possibility of determining a sort of stimulation of the immune system, with an unexpected ""systemic"" response to treatments designed to be ""local"". In the present article the mechanisms of action of HIFU are described, and the main clinical applications of this technique are reported, with a particular focus on the immune-stimulation process that might originate from tumour ablations.",1
"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is rapidly gaining clinical acceptance as a technique capable of providing non-invasive heating and ablation for a wide range of applications. Usually requiring only a single session, treatments are often conducted as day case procedures, with the patient either fully conscious, lightly sedated or under light general anesthesia. HIFU scores over other thermal ablation techniques because of the lack of necessity for the transcutaneous insertion of probes into the target tissue. Sources placed either outside the body (for treatment of tumors or abnormalities of the liver, kidney, breast, uterus, pancreas brain and bone), or in the rectum (for treatment of the prostate), provide rapid heating of a target tissue volume, the highly focused nature of the field leaving tissue in the ultrasound propagation path relatively unaffected. Numerous extra-corporeal, transrectal and interstitial devices have been designed to optimize application-specific treatment delivery for the wide-ranging areas of application that are now being explored with HIFU. Their principle of operation is described here, and an overview of their design principles is given.",1
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally invasive therapy applied for prostate cancer that capitalizes on the coagulation necrosis that occurs at temperatures greater than 60°C. Owing to a lack of long-term follow-up data the procedure is still considered experimental treatment. As primary therapy, HIFU is indicated in patients aged ≥70 years with clinical organ-confined disease, although it has also been used, with encouraging results, as first line salvage therapy after definitive treatment, and in locally advanced (T3-4) and non-metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Morbidity associated with this treatment method appears to be low and includes urinary retention (1-9%), urethral stricture (4-14%), incontinence (1-15%), erectile dysfunction (13-53%) and rectourethral fistulae (0-3%). The risk of complications increases with repeated treatments. A few studies have recently been published on HIFU as focal therapy. HIFU technology can be enhanced using means such as ultrasound microbubble contrast agents for assessment of therapy efficacy, magnetic resonance imaging to guide the enhancement of heat rate, and localized drug and gene delivery.",1
