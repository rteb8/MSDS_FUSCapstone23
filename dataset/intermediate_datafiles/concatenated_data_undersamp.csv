"Focused ultrasound (FUS)-enabled liquid biopsy (sonobiopsy) is an emerging technique for the noninvasive and spatiotemporally controlled diagnosis of brain cancer by inducing blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption to release brain tumor-specific biomarkers into the blood circulation. The feasibility, safety, and efficacy of sonobiopsy were demonstrated in both small and large animal models using magnetic resonance-guided FUS devices. However, the high cost and complex operation of magnetic resonance-guided FUS devices limit the future broad application of sonobiopsy in the clinic. In this study, a neuronavigation-guided sonobiopsy device is developed and its targeting accuracy is characterized in vitro, in vivo, and in silico. The sonobiopsy device integrated a commercially available neuronavigation system (BrainSight) with a nimble, lightweight FUS transducer. Its targeting accuracy was characterized in vitro in a water tank using a hydrophone. The performance of the device in BBB disruption was verified in vivo using a pig model, and the targeting accuracy was quantified by measuring the offset between the target and the actual locations of BBB opening. The feasibility of the FUS device in targeting glioblastoma (GBM) tumors was evaluated in silico using numerical simulation by the k-Wave toolbox in glioblastoma patients. It was found that the targeting accuracy of the neuronavigation-guided sonobiopsy device was 1.7 ± 0.8 mm as measured in the water tank. The neuronavigation-guided FUS device successfully induced BBB disruption in pigs with a targeting accuracy of 3.3 ± 1.4 mm. The targeting accuracy of the FUS transducer at the GBM tumor was 5.5 ± 4.9 mm. Age, sex, and incident locations were found to be not correlated with the targeting accuracy in GBM patients. This study demonstrated that the developed neuronavigation-guided FUS device could target the brain with a high spatial targeting accuracy, paving the foundation for its application in the clinic.",0
"OBJECTIVE: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) followed by curettage or uterine artery embolization (UAE) followed by curettage are relatively effective methods for cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP), which can provide a high success rate and repregnancy while reducing blood loss and adverse events. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pregnancy outcomes of HIFU groups versus UAE groups with CSP. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases were systematically searched to find studies that compared the therapeutic effects of HIFU groups versus UAE groups. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Our primary end points were blood loss, adverse events, success rate, and repregnancy. We implemented random-effects models or fixed-effects models to evaluate the pooled data. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Thirty-four eligible items were included in studies. The blood loss was significantly reduced in HIFU groups compared with UAE groups (standardized mean difference = -1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.21 to -0.68; p <.001). Significantly fewer adverse events occurred in the HIFU groups than in UAE groups (odds ratio [OR] = 0.36, 95% CI, 0.23-0.57; p <.001). The success rate of HIFU groups was higher than that of UAE groups (OR = 1.56, 95% CI, 1.05-2.32; p = .03). There were more pregnancies in HIFU groups than in UAE groups (OR = 1.64, 95% CI, 1.28-2.11; p <.001). CONCLUSION: In the CSP, the effect of HIFU groups was better than that of UAE groups: less blood loss, high success rate, fewer adverse events, and favorable fertility protection. Thus, it is a promising therapeutic method for patients.",0
"Luminol is a classic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) luminophore. The luminol-O2 ECL system suffers from a problem, that is, the conversion rate of dissolved O2 into reactive oxygen species (ROS) is low. In this work, we used high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) pretreatment combined with Ti3C2-TiO2 to construct a highly sensitive luminol-O2 ECL system for the specific detection of polynucleotide kinase (PNK) first. On the one hand, HIFU generated ROS in situ as a coreactant via the cavitation effect to boost the luminol emission. On the other hand, Ti3C2-TiO2 was prepared in situ via Ti3C2 as a reducing agent, and it can aggregate and catalyze ROS generated in situ by HIFU. Moreover, the Ti on the Ti3C2-TiO2 surface could bind to phosphate groups through chelation, thereby realizing highly specific detection of PNK. The sensor has a linear relationship range of 1.0 × 10-5 to 10.0 U mL-1, and the limit of detection is 1.48 × 10-7 U mL-1, which is superior to most existing methods. The sensor performance in HeLa cell lysate was measured with a satisfactory result. The designed ECL biosensor has potential applications in biological analysis and clinical diagnosis.",0
"BabelBrain is an open-source standalone graphic-user-interface application designed for studies of neuromodulation using transcranial focused ultrasound. It calculates the transmitted acoustic field in the brain tissue, taking into account the distortion effects caused by the skull barrier. The simulation is prepared using scans from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, if available, computed tomography and zero-echo time MRI scans. It also calculates the thermal effects based on a given ultrasound regime, such as the total duration of exposure, the duty cycle, and acoustic intensity. The tool is designed to work in tandem with neuronavigation and visualization software, such as 3DSlicer. It uses image processing to prepare domains for ultrasound simulation and uses the BabelViscoFDTD library for transcranial modeling calculations. BabelBrain supports multiple GPU backends, including Metal, OpenCL, and CUDA, and works on all major operating systems including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This tool is particularly optimized for Apple ARM64 systems, which are common in brain imaging research. The paper presents the modeling pipeline used in BabelBrain and a numerical study where different methods of acoustic properties mapping were tested to select the best method that can reproduce the transcranial pressure transmission efficiency reported in the literature.",0
"Focused ultrasound is a novel technique for the treatment of aggressive brain tumors that uses both mechanical and thermal mechanisms. This non-invasive technique can allow for both the thermal ablation of inoperable tumors and the delivery of chemotherapy and immunotherapy while minimizing the risk of infection and shortening the time to recovery. With recent advances, focused ultrasound has been increasingly effective for larger tumors without the need for a craniotomy and can be used with minimal surrounding soft tissue damage. Treatment efficacy is dependent on multiple variables, including blood-brain barrier permeability, patient anatomical features, and tumor-specific features. Currently, many clinical trials are currently underway for the treatment of non-neoplastic cranial pathologies and other non-cranial malignancies. In this article, we review the current state of surgical management of brain tumors using focused ultrasound.",0
"Purpose: The application of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was promising. However, whether the effect of HIFU is comparable with that of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has not been determined.Materials and methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, WanFang Data, CqVip, CNKI, and CBM databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies. The methodological quality of each study was evaluated. When there is no statistical heterogeneity, the fixed effect model would be used to merge data. Otherwise, the random effect model would be utilized. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding one study each time. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on age, sex, tumor number, relative number of the patients with Child-Pugh C grade in each group, the percentage of patients with Child-Pugh C grade in the whole study, and tumor load. Publication bias was evaluated by Egger's test and Begg's test.Results: Six cohort studies including 188 patients from HIFU group and 224 patients from TACE group were obtained for further analysis. The meta-analysis suggested HIFU and TACE showed no differences in postoperative 1-year overall survival (OS) rate, tumor response (including complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease), and postoperative complications. Moreover, compared with TACE, HIFU showed higher postoperative 6-month and 2-year OS rates. Subgroup analyses, meta regression analysis and sensitivity analyses indicated the findings above were reliable. Additionally, no potential publication bias was detected.Conclusion: For HCC, when compared with TACE, HIFU might show comparable safety but better effect. Considering the limitations of current studies, more well-designed studies are needed to validate our conclusion.",0
"Historically, pathological brain lesions provided the foundation for localization of symptoms and therapeutic lesions were used as a treatment for brain diseases. New medications, functional neuroimaging and deep brain stimulation led to a decline in lesions in the past few decades. However, recent advances have improved our ability to localize lesion-induced symptoms, including localization to brain circuits rather than individual brain regions. Improved localization can lead to more precise treatment targets, which may mitigate traditional advantages of deep brain stimulation over lesions such as reversibility and tunability. New tools for creating therapeutic brain lesions such as high intensity focused ultrasound allow for lesions to be placed without a skin incision and are already in clinical use for tremor. Although there are limitations and caution is warranted, improvements in lesion-based localization are refining our therapeutic targets and improved technology is providing new ways to create therapeutic lesions, which together may facilitate the return of the lesion.",0
"Transcranial ultrasound is more and more used for therapy and imaging of the brain. However, the skull is a highly attenuating and aberrating medium, with different structures and acoustic properties among samples and even within a sample. Thus, case-specific simulations are needed to perform transcranial focused ultrasound interventions safely. In this article, we provide a review of the different methods used to model the skull and to simulate ultrasound propagation through it.",0
"In recent years, veterinary medicine has expanded its practices beyond conventional methods, gradually integrating the Focused Ultrasound (FUS) technology in the care of companion animals like dogs and cats. The current study aimed to examine the feasibility and provide insights into the application of thermal FUS in canine and feline mammary cancer therapy. FUS was delivered by a 2-MHz single-element spherically focused ultrasonic transducer as integrated with an existing robotic positioning device. The functionality of the FUS system and sonication protocol in efficiently and safely ablating live tissue was initially validated in a rabbit thigh model in a laboratory environment. Nine (9) dogs and cats with superficial mammary cancer were recruited through a dedicated campaign according to specific safety criteria. The veterinary patients underwent FUS ablation followed by immediate surgical resection of the entire malignancy. Histopathology examination demonstrated well-defined regions of coagulative necrosis in all treated tumors with no off-target damage. Further study with a larger patient population is needed to confirm the current findings and demonstrate the safety and feasibility of complete FUS ablation of deep-seated tumors.",0
"Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are slow-growing tumors in the central nervous system (CNS). Patients characteristically show the onset of seizures or neurological deficits due to the predominant LGG location in high-functional brain areas. As a molecular hallmark, LGGs display mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes, resulting in an altered cellular energy metabolism and the production of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate. Despite the remarkable progress in improving the extent of resection and adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, LGG remains incurable, and secondary malignant transformation is often observed. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. In recent years, immunotherapeutic strategies have led to tremendous success in various cancer types, but the effect of immunotherapy against glioma has been limited due to several challenges, such as tumor heterogeneity and the immunologically ""cold"" tumor microenvironment. Nevertheless, recent preclinical and clinical findings from immunotherapy trials are encouraging and offer a glimmer of hope for treating IDH-mutant LGG patients. Here, we aim to review the lessons learned from trials involving vaccines, T-cell therapies, and IDH-mutant inhibitors and discuss future approaches to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies in IDH-mutant LGG.",0
"To compare the treatment efficacies of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), HIFU combined with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a), and HIFU combined with GnRH-a and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) for adenomyosis. We conducted a literature search in SCIENCE DIRECT, COCHRANE LIBRARY, WILLEY ONLINE LIBRARY, PUBMED, and TAYLOR FRANCIS. A total of 471 articles identified, 12 were included in a systematic review, and 11 of them deemed quantitively eligible included in the meta-analysis. The efficacies of the three treatment regimens were assessed using the dysmenorrhea and menstrual scores at 3, 6, 12, 24 months. Of the three regimens, HIFU combined with GnRH-a and LNG-IUS provides the best outcome. On dysmenorrhea score at 6 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity with P < 0.00001 (I2 = 100% WMD 21.44 [6.34, 36.53]) with statistical significance P = 0.005. At 12 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.00001 (I2 = 100% WMD 23.47 [6.00, 40.94]) with statistically significant P < 0.008. At 24 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.0005 (I2 = 92% WMD 6.05 [4.81, 7.30]) with statistical significance P < 0.00001. HIFU combined with GnRH-a and LNG-IUS on menstrual score at 3 months was significantly different higher heterogeneity with P < 0.00001 (I2 = 100% WMD 56.23 [16.01, 96.45]) with statistical significance P = 0.006. At 6 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.00001 (I2 = 99% WMD 93.86 [64.15, 123.57]) with statistical significance P < 0.00001. At 12 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.00001 (I2 = 99% WMD 97.13 [67.81, 126.46]) with statistical significance P < 0.00001 compared to treatments with only HIFU and HIFU combined with GnRH-a. HIFU combined with GnRH-a and LNG-IUS treatment is more effective than only HIFU monotherapy and HIFU combined with GnRH-a.",0
"OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative safety and effectiveness of two prostate cancer treatment ablation modalities-irreversible electroporation (IRE) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).  METHODS: Two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) on IRE and HIFU were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted in PubMed and EMBASE. Independent reviewers assessed literature eligibility and abstracted safety and effectiveness data. Oncological, safety, functional, and quality of life (QOL) outcomes were examined for each technology. MAs were conducted where data quality and availability allowed, using normal methods and a random/mixed effects model, and quality assessments performed. RESULTS: Fifty-five publications (n=22 IRE; n=33 HIFU) were included in the SLRs, and MAs were conducted on negative in-field post-procedure biopsy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level reduction, potency, urinary continence, and AE rate outcomes. MAs revealed that IRE patients had lower mean percent PSA level reductions, higher mean rates of in-field negative post-treatment biopsy, and higher rates of potency maintenance than HIFU patients. Most adverse events (AEs) reported were comparable and minor (Grades I, II), with urinary tract infection, dysuria, hematuria, and incontinence or urgency most frequently reported. The proportion of patients experiencing a severe AE (≥Grade III) ranged from 0 to 8% after IRE and HIFU. Both modalities were associated with positive functional outcomes as well as maintenance of QOL after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both IRE and HIFU were found to produce favorable effectiveness outcomes and have low complication rates while minimally impacting patient urinary and erectile function and maintaining overall QOL. These real-world findings can help guide clinical decision making and improve disease management for patients with prostate cancer.",0
"BACKGROUND: neurosurgical interventions such as MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) are increasingly deployed for treatment of essential tremor. OBJECTIVE: to make recommendations for monitoring treatment effects during and after MRgFUS based on our investigation of correlations between different scales of tremor severity. METHODS: twenty-five clinical assessments were collected from thirteen patients before and after unilateral MRgFUS sequential lesioning of the thalamus and posterior subthalamic area for alleviating essential tremor. Scales included Bain Findley Spirography (BFS), Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST), Upper Extremity Total Tremor Score (UETTS) and Quality of Life of Essential Tremor (QUEST), and were documented at baseline, while lying in the scanner with stereotactic frame attached (BFS), and at 24-month follow-up. RESULTS: the four different scales of tremor severity all correlated significantly. BFS and CRST showed a strong correlation of 0.833 (p < 0.001). BFS, UETTS and CRST correlated moderately with QUEST (ρ = 0.575-0.721, p < 0.001). BFS and UETTS correlated significantly with all CRST subparts, with the strongest correlation between UETTS and CRST part C (ρ = 0.831, p < 0.001). Moreover, BFS drawn sitting upright in an outpatient setting correlated with spirals drawn in a supine position on the scanner bed with the stereotactic frame attached. CONCLUSION: we recommend a combination of BFS & UETTS for intraoperative assessment of awake essential tremor patients and BFS & QUEST for pre-operative and follow-up assessments, as these scale sets are quick and simple to collect and provide meaningful information whilst meeting the practical constraints of intraoperative assessment.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Currently available cytotoxic treatments have limited effect on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) because desmoplastic stroma limits drug delivery. Efforts have been made to overcome these barriers by drug targeting the tumor microenvironment. Results so far are promising, but without clinical impact. Our aim was to investigate whether ultrasound and microbubbles could improve the uptake and therapeutic response of conventional chemotherapy. METHODS: Orthotopic pancreatic tumors growing in mice were treated with commercially available FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and calcium folinate) and SonoVue microbubbles combined with focused ultrasound. Tumor uptake of platinum (Pt) was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and tumor volumes were measured by ultrasound imaging. DISCUSSION: Uptake of Pt, the active ingredient of oxaliplatin, was significantly increased after ultrasound treatment of orthotopic PDAC tumors. Multiple injections with FOLFIRONOX increased the amount of Pt in tumors. However, the enhanced accumulation did not improve therapeutic response. Increased uptake of Pt confirms that ultrasound and microbubbles have potential in clinical practice with existing drugs. CONCLUSION: The lack of therapeutic response, despite increased uptake in tumor tissue, emphasizes the importance of studying how to overcome stromal barriers.",0
"Background.Noninvasive and cell-type-specific neuromodulation tools are critically needed for probing intact brain function. Sonogenetics for noninvasive activation of neurons engineered to express thermosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) by transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) was recently developed to address this need. However, using TRPV1-mediated sonogenetics to evoke behavior by targeting the cortex is challenged by its proximity to the skull due to high skull absorption of ultrasound and increased risks of thermal-induced tissue damage.Objective.This study evaluated the feasibility and safety of TRPV1-mediated sonogenetics in targeting the motor cortex to modulate the locomotor behavior of freely moving mice.Approach.Adeno-associated viral vectors was delivered to the mouse motor cortex via intracranial injection to express TRPV1 in excitatory neurons. A wearable FUS device was installed on the mouse head after a month to control neuronal activity by activating virally expressed TRPV1 through FUS sonication at different acoustic pressures. Immunohistochemistry staining ofex vivobrain slices was performed to verify neuron activation and evaluate safety.Results.TRPV1-mediated sonogenetic stimulation at 0.7 MPa successfully evoked rotational behavior in the direction contralateral to the stimulation site, activated cortical neurons as indicated by the upregulation of c-Fos, and did not induce significant changes in inflammatory or apoptotic markers (GFAP, Iba1, and Caspase-3). Sonogenetic stimulation of TRPV1 mice at a higher acoustic pressure, 1.1 MPa, induced significant changes in motor behavior and upregulation of c-Fos compared with FUS sonication of naïve mice at 1.1 MPa. However, signs of damage at the meninges were observed at 1.1 MPa.Significance.TRPV1-mediated sonogenetics can achieve effective and safe neuromodulation at the cortex with carefully selected FUS parameters. These findings expand the application of this technique to include superficial brain targets.",0
"The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) tremor remains incompletely understood and there is a lack of clinical trials specifically addressing its pharmacological treatment. Levodopa is the most efficacious drug for most patients and should be used as primary approach to control troublesome tremor. While the efficacy of oral dopamine agonists on PD tremor has been demonstrated in controlled trials, there is no evidence of greater antitremor efficacy compared to levodopa. The magnitude of the antitremor effect of anticholinergics is generally lower than that of levodopa. Due to their adverse effects, anticholinergics have a limited role in selected young and cognitively intact patients. Propranolol may improve resting and action tremor and may be considered as an adjunct in patients with insufficient tremor response to levodopa and this also applies to clozapine, despite its unfavorable adverse effect profile. Treating motor fluctuations with MAO-B and COMT inhibitors, dopamine agonists, amantadine, or on-demand treatments such as subcutaneous or sublingual apomorphine and inhaled levodopa as well as with continuous infusions of levodopa or apomorphine will improve off period tremor episodes. For patients with drug-refractory PD tremor despite levodopa optimization deep brain stimulation and focused ultrasound are first-line considerations. Surgery can also be highly effective for the treatment medication-refractory tremor in selected patients without motor fluctuations. The present review highlights the clinical essentials of parkinsonian tremor, critically examines available trial data on the effects of medication and surgical approaches and provides guidance for the choice of treatments to control PD tremor in clinical practice.",0
"To improve the ultrasonic energy and realize far-field ultrasonic abrasive machining of complex surfaces, a spherical-array-focused ultrasonic abrasive machining system was established. By combining ultrasonic field simulation, detection and a single-factor experiment, the influences of the ultrasonic generator current, abrasive concentration, and particle size on the material removal properties and surface quality evolution of quartz glass were investigated. When the current was less than 0.4 A, the material removal showed plastic removal at the nanoscale. When the current was more than 0.5 A, the cavitation phenomenon formed micron-scale impact removal traces on the workpiece surface. The increase in abrasive concentration increased the impact density and material removal rate, while excessive abrasive concentration increased the impeding effect between abrasive particles and reduced the material removal rate. Moreover, the increase in abrasive particle concentration enhanced heterogeneous cavitation nucleation, promoted the removal of abrasive impact materials under the action of a cavitation jet, and inhibited the removal of direct surface cavitation. The abrasive particle size affects the heterogeneous cavitation nucleation and the acceleration of the cavitation jet on abrasive particles, which affects the material removal rate and surface quality. By controlling the energy of the focused ultrasound and abrasive parameters, the plastic or brittle domain removal of quartz glass can be achieved at the micro- and nanoscales.",0
"An accurate method for neural stimulation within the brain could be very useful for treating brain circuit dysfunctions and neurological disorders. With the aim of developing such a method, this study investigated the use of piezoelectric molybdenum disulfide nanosheets (MoS2 NS) to remotely convert ultrasound energy into localized electrical stimulation in vitro and in vivo. The application of ultrasound to cells surrounding MoS2 NS required only a single pulse of 2 MHz ultrasound (400 kPa, 1,000,000 cycles, and 500 ms pulse duration) to elicit significant responses in 37.9 ± 7.4% of cells in terms of fluxes of calcium ions without detectable cellular damage. The proportion of responsive cells was mainly influenced by the acoustic pressure, number of ultrasound cycles, and concentration of MoS2 NS. Tests using appropriate blockers revealed that voltage-gated membrane channels were activated. In vivo data suggested that, with ultrasound stimulation, neurons closest to the MoS2 NS were 3-fold more likely to present c-Fos expression than cells far from the NS. The successful activation of neurons surrounding MoS2 NS suggests that this represents a method with high spatial precision for selectively modulating one or several targeted brain circuits.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Focused ultrasound ablation (FUSA) is an emerging treatment for neurological and psychiatric diseases. We describe the initial experience from a pilot, open-label, single-center clinical trial of unilateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) FUSA in patients with treatment-refractory epilepsy. METHODS: Two adult subjects with treatment-refractory, focal onset epilepsy were recruited. The subjects received ANT FUSA using the Exablate Neuro (Insightec) system. We determined the safety and feasibility (primary outcomes), and changes in seizure frequency (secondary outcome) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Safety was assessed by the absence of side effects, that is, new onset neurological deficits or performance deterioration on neuropsychological testing. Feasibility was defined as the ability to create a lesion within the anterior nucleus. The monthly seizure frequency was compared between baseline and postthalamotomy. RESULTS: The patients tolerated the procedure well, without neurological deficits or serious adverse events. One patient experienced a decline in verbal fluency, attention/working memory, and immediate verbal memory. Seizure frequency reduced significantly in both patients; one patient was seizure-free at 12 months, and in the second patient, the frequency reduced from 90-100 seizures per month to 3-6 seizures per month. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first known clinical trial to assess the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of ANT FUSA in adult patients with treatment-refractory focal onset epilepsy.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Medial thalamotomies were introduced in the late 1940s. Pain relief was shown to be achieved for all body locations. With some exceptions, these early relatively small series showed frequent, more or less complete recurrence of the original pain. The posterior part of the central lateral nucleus in the human medial thalamus was identified in the 1990s using multiarchitectonic studies and intraoperative single-cell recordings and was confirmed as a surgical target. This retrospective patient series extended over 11 years. Its goal was to demonstrate the efficacy and risk profile of the MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) central lateral thalamotomy (CLT) against chronic and therapy-resistant neuropathic (i.e., neurogenic) pain. METHODS: In this single-center, nonrandomized retrospective cross-sectional analysis of consecutive patients, 63 consecutive MRgFUS CLT interventions were performed in 55 patients. RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 55 months. A total of 112 CLT targets were performed, and the CLT was applied bilaterally in 48 patients and contralateral to their pain in 7 patients. Repeat MRgFUS interventions were performed in 8 patients. One serious adverse event with numbness of the upper lip was recorded. The mean pain relief rated by patients was 42% ± 32% at 3 months, 43% ± 36% at 1 year, and 42% ± 37% at the last follow-up (n = 63). The proportions of cases with ≥ 30% pain relief were 65% at 3 months, 63% at 1 year, and 61% at the last follow-up. Good outcomes (≥ 50% pain relief) were found in 54% of patients at 3 months, 49% at 1 year, and 51% at the last follow-up. The reduction in mean VAS scores showed similar percentage reductions as those for pain relief (-41% for continuous pain and -49% for pain attacks) at the 1-year follow-up. The mean frequency of pain attacks was reduced by 92%. Allodynia was reduced or suppressed in 68% of patients and never appeared de novo after MRgFUS CLT. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MRgFUS CLT against neuropathic pain is a safe approach and its results are stable over time. At a mean follow-up duration of 55 months, the mean pain relief was 42% and more than 50% of patients still reported ≥ 50% pain relief. Patients with classical and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia reported a higher mean pain relief compared with the whole patient group.",0
"Introduction: The side effects of conventional therapy for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are severe, with inflammatory reactions playing a pivotal role. It is particularly important to explore new ways of treatment thrombosis by targeting inflammatory factors. Methods: A targeted microbubble contrast agent was prepared using the biotin-avidin method. The 40 DVT model rabbits were established and divided into four groups according to different treatment regimens. The four coagulation indexes, TNF-α, and D-dimer content of experimental animals were measured before modeling and before and after treatment, and the thrombolysis was assessed by ultrasound imaging. Finally, the results were verified by pathology. Results and Discussion: Fluorescence microscopy verified the successful preparation of targeted microbubbles. Among the groups, PT, APTT, and TT in Group II-IV were longer than those in Group I (all p < 0.05). FIB and D-dimer content were lower than those in Group I (all p < 0.05), and TNF-α content in Group IV was lower than that in Group I-III (all p < 0.05). Pairwise comparison before modeling and before treatment and after treatment showed that, after treatment, the PT, APTT, and TT in Group II-IV were longer than those before modeling (all p < 0.05). The contents of FIB and D-dimer were lower than those before modeling and before treatment (all p < 0.05). The content of TNF-α decreased significantly only in Group IV, but increased in the other three groups. Targeted microbubbles combined with Low-power focused ultrasound can reduce inflammation, significantly promote thrombolysis, and provide new ideas and methods for the diagnosis and treatment of acute DVT.",0
"BACKGROUND: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been developed for the treatment of skin wrinkles on the face, neck, and body. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a home-used HIFU device on wrinkles in mice based on the expression of fibrosis-related genes and proteins. METHODS: The backs of 20-week-old mice were treated with a home-used HIFU using the following probes: 4 MHz, 1.5 mm focal depth. The treated mice were compared with young mice by histological examination, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunohistochemistry. Histological examination was performed by trichrome staining. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were conducted to determine the expression of collagen types I and III, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1. RESULTS: Dermal thickness was increased after treatment with the home-used HIFU device at 30 and 60 s per day for 1 week or 30 and 60 s per day for 2 weeks on trichrome. Gene and protein expression of collagen types I and III and elastin were increased after treatment with HIFU at all options of 30 and 60 s per day for 1 week or 30 and 60 s per day for 2 weeks. Gene and protein expressions of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 were decreased after treatment with HIFU device at 30 and 60 s per day for 1 week or 30 and 60 s per day for 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: The home-used HIFU device can be an effective therapeutic modality for skin tightening.",0
"Background and Purpose- The prediction of long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients may be useful in treatment decisions. Machine learning techniques are being increasingly adapted for use in the medical field because of their high accuracy. This study investigated the applicability of machine learning techniques to predict long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients. Methods- This was a retrospective study using a prospective cohort that enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score 0, 1, or 2 at 3 months. We developed 3 machine learning models (deep neural network, random forest, and logistic regression) and compared their predictability. To evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning models, we also compared them to the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL) score. Results- A total of 2604 patients were included in this study, and 2043 (78%) of them had favorable outcomes. The area under the curve for the deep neural network model was significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score (0.888 versus 0.839; P<0.001), while the areas under the curves of the random forest (0.857; P=0.136) and logistic regression (0.849; P=0.413) models were not significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score. Using only the 6 variables that are used for the ASTRAL score, the performance of the machine learning models did not significantly differ from that of the ASTRAL score. Conclusions- Machine learning algorithms, particularly the deep neural network, can improve the prediction of long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients.",0
"Although ultrasonography is an important cost-effective imaging modality, technical improvements are needed before its full potential is realized for accurate and reproducible monitoring of carotid disease and plaque burden. 2D viewing of 3D anatomy, using conventional ultrasonography limits our ability to quantify and visualize carotid disease and is partly responsible for the reported variability in diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Efforts of investigators have focused on overcoming these deficiencies by developing 3D ultrasound imaging techniques that are capable of acquiring B-mode, color Doppler and power Doppler images of the carotid arteries using existing conventional ultrasound systems, reconstructing the information into 3D images, and then allowing interactive viewing of the 3D images on inexpensive desktop computers. In addition, the availability of 3D ultrasound images of the carotid arteries has allowed the development of techniques to quantify plaque volume and surface morphology as well as allowing registration with other 3D imaging modalities. This paper describes 3D ultrasound imaging techniques used to image the carotid arteries and summarizes some of the developments aimed at quantifying plaque volume and morphology.",0
"Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) provide an efficient way to diagnose the presence of diseases such as breast cancer using ultrasound images (USIs). Globally, breast cancer is one of the major causes of increased mortality rates among women. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) models are widely employed in the detection and classification of tumors in USIs. The CAD systems are designed in such a way that they provide recommendations to help radiologists in diagnosing breast tumors and, furthermore, in disease prognosis. The accuracy of the classification process is decided by the quality of images and the radiologist’s experience. The design of Deep Learning (DL) models is found to be effective in the classification of breast cancer. In the current study, an Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Classification (EDLCDS-BCDC) technique was developed using USIs. The proposed EDLCDS-BCDC technique was intended to identify the existence of breast cancer using USIs. In this technique, USIs initially undergo pre-processing through two stages, namely wiener filtering and contrast enhancement. Furthermore, Chaotic Krill Herd Algorithm (CKHA) is applied with Kapur’s entropy (KE) for the image segmentation process. In addition, an ensemble of three deep learning models, VGG-16, VGG-19, and SqueezeNet, is used for feature extraction. Finally, Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model is utilized to classify the images based on whether breast cancer exists or not. A wide range of simulations were carried out on benchmark databases and the extensive results highlight the better outcomes of the proposed EDLCDS-BCDC technique over recent methods. In the literature, there exist plenty of research works focused on the detection and classification of breast cancer. However, only a few works have focused on the classification of breast cancer using ultrasound scan images. Although deep transfer learning models are useful in breast cancer classification, owing to their outstanding performance in a number of applications, image pre-processing and segmentation techniques are essential. In this context, the current study developed a new Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for the diagnosis and classification of breast cancer using ultrasound images. In the study, an optimal multi-level thresholding-based image segmentation technique was designed to identify the tumor-affected regions. The study also developed an ensemble of three deep learning models for feature extraction and an optimal machine learning classifier for breast cancer detection. The study offers a means of assisting radiologists and healthcare professionals in the breast cancer classification process.",0
"PURPOSE: Previous ultrasonographic studies of individuals with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) have shown nerve enlargement at several sites. This prospective study compares only the bilateral median and ulnar nerves of individuals with CIDP with reference values to determine the clinical usefulness of this focused approach as a diagnostic tool. METHODS: The cross-sectional area, echogenicity, and vascularity of the bilateral median and ulnar nerves of 25 subjects with CIDP were measured using ultrasound. Nineteen had typical CIDP based on the European Federation of Neurological Societies and the Peripheral Nerve Society guidelines, whereas six had atypical CIDP and were diagnosed based on clinical impression. RESULTS: Focal nerve enlargement was found in at least one segment in all subjects. Subjects with typical CIDP had larger cross-sectional areas compared with subjects with atypical CIDP. CONCLUSION: A focused ultrasound study, involving only the median and ulnar nerves, is sensitive for the detection of nerve enlargement in CIDP. Measuring the cross-sectional area of the median and ulnar nerves is clinically feasible and may help establish the diagnosis of CIDP.",0
"PURPOSE: The study aims to provide insights on the practicality of using single-element transducers for transcranial Focused Ultrasound (tFUS) thermal applications. METHODS: FUS sonications were performed through skull phantoms embedding agar-based tissue mimicking gels using a 1 MHz single-element spherically focused transducer. The skull phantoms were 3D printed with Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) and Resin thermoplastics having the exact skull bone geometry of a healthy volunteer. The temperature field distribution during and after heating was monitored in a 3 T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner using MR thermometry. The effect of the skull's thickness on intracranial heating was investigated. RESULTS: A single FUS sonication at focal acoustic intensities close to 1580 W/cm2 for 60 s in free field heated up the agar phantom to ablative temperatures reaching about 90 °C (baseline of 37 °C). The ABS skull strongly blocked the ultrasonic waves, resulting in zero temperature increase within the phantom. Considerable heating was achieved through the Resin skull, but it remained at hyperthermia levels. Conversely, tFUS through a 1 mm Resin skull showed enhanced ultrasonic penetration and heating, with the focal temperature reaching 70 °C. CONCLUSIONS: The ABS skull demonstrated poorer performance in terms of tFUS compared to the Resin skull owing to its higher ultrasonic attenuation and porosity. The thin Resin phantom of 1 mm thickness provided an efficient acoustic window for delivering tFUS and heating up deep phantom areas. The results of such studies could be particularly useful for accelerating the establishment of a wider range of tFUS applications.",0
"We present an all-optical focused ultrasound transducer with a sub-millimeter aperture and demonstrate its capability for high-resolution imaging of tissue ex vivo. The transducer is composed of a wideband silicon photonics ultrasound detector and a miniature acoustic lens coated with a thin optically absorbing metallic layer used to produce laser-generated ultrasound. The demonstrated device achieves axial resolution and lateral resolutions of 12 μm and 60 μm, respectively, well below typical values achieved by conventional piezoelectric intravascular ultrasound. The size and resolution of the developed transducer may enable its use for intravascular imaging of thin fibrous cap atheroma.",0
"RNAi has considerable potential as a cancer therapeutic approach, but effective and efficient delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA) to tumors remains a major hurdle. It remains a challenge to prepare a functional siRNA complex, target enough dose to the tumor, and stimulate its internalization into tumor cells and its release to the cytoplasm. Here, we show how these key barriers to siRNA delivery can be overcome with a complex─comprising siRNA, cationic lipids, and pH-responsive peptides─that is suited to tumor uptake enhancement via focused ultrasound (FUS). The complex provides effective nucleic acid encapsulation, nuclease protection, and endosomal escape such that gene silencing in cells is substantially more effective than that obtained with either equivalent lipoplexes or commercial reagents. In mice bearing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts, both lipid and ternary, lipid:peptide:siRNA complexes, prepared with near-infrared fluorescently labeled siRNA, accumulate in tumors following FUS treatments. Therefore, combining a well-designed lipid:peptide:siRNA complex with FUS tumor treatments is a promising route to achieve robust in vivo gene delivery.",0
"Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) uses ultrasonic pulsations at lower intensities than ultrasound and is being tested as a reversible and precise neuromodulatory technology. Although LIFU-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening has been explored in detail, no standardized technique for blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) opening has been established to date. Therefore, this protocol presents a method for successful BSCB disruption using LIFU sonication in a rat model, including descriptions of animal preparation, microbubble administration, target selection and localization, as well as BSCB disruption visualization and confirmation. The approach reported here is particularly useful for researchers who need a fast and cost-effective method to test and confirm target localization and precise BSCB disruption in a small animal model with a focused ultrasound transducer, evaluate the BSCB efficacy of sonication parameters, or explore applications for LIFU at the spinal cord, such as drug delivery, immunomodulation, and neuromodulation. Optimizing this protocol for individual use is recommended, especially for advancing future preclinical, clinical, and translational work.",0
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly regulated physical and functional boundarythat tightly controls the transport of materials between the blood and the brain. There is an increasing recognition that the BBB is dysfunctional in a wide range of neurological disorders; this dysfunction can be symptomatic of the disease but can also play a role in disease etiology. BBB dysfunction can be exploited for the delivery of therapeutic nanomaterials. Forexample, there can be a transient, physical disruption of the BBB in diseases such as brain injury and stroke, which allows temporary access of nanomaterials into the brain. Physicaldisruption of the BBB through external energy sources is now being clinically pursued toincrease therapeutic delivery into the brain. In other diseases, the BBB takes on new properties that can beleveraged by delivery carriers. For instance, neuroinflammation induces the expression ofreceptors on the BBB that can be targeted by ligand-modified nanomaterials, and theendogenous homing of immune cells into the diseased brain can be hijacked for the delivery ofnanomaterials. Lastly, BBB transport pathways can be altered to increase nanomaterial transport. In this review, we will describe changes that can occur in the BBB in disease, and how these changes have been exploited by engineered nanomaterials forincreased transport into the brain.",0
"Novel treatment options for uterine fibroids, such as uterine artery embolization (UAE), ultrasound-guided and magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU and MRgHIFU), and transcervical radiofrequency ablation (TFA) methods, are widely used in clinical practice. This systematic review and meta-analysis (CRD42022297312) aims to assess and compare reproductive and obstetric outcomes in women who underwent these minimally invasive approaches for uterine fibroids. The search was performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Cochrane guidelines. The articles were selected to meet the following eligibility criteria: (1) research article, (2) human subject research, and (3) the study of pregnancy outcomes after the treatment of uterine fibroids by either one of three methods-UAE, HIFU, and TFA. The analysis of 25 eligible original articles shows a similar rate of live births for UAE, USgHIFU, MRgHIFU, and TFA (70.8%, 73.5%, 70%, and 75%, respectively). The number of pregnancies varied considerably among these studies, as well as the mean age of pregnant women. However, the results of pregnancy outcomes for TFA are insufficient to draw firm conclusions, since only 24 women became pregnant in these studies, resulting in three live births. The miscarriage rate was highest in the UAE group (19.2%). USgHIFU was associated with a higher rate of placental abnormalities compared to UAE (2.8% vs. 1.6%). The pooled estimate of pregnancies was 17.31% to 44.52% after UAE, 18.69% to 78.53% after HIFU, and 2.09% to 7.63% after TFA. The available evidence confirmed that these minimally invasive uterine-sparing treatment options for uterine fibroids are a good approach for patients wishing to preserve their fertility, with comparable reproductive and obstetric outcomes among the different techniques.",0
"Gene delivery via focused ultrasound (FUS) mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening is a disruptive therapeutic modality. Unlocking its full potential will require an understanding of how FUS parameters (e.g., peak-negative pressure (PNP)) affect transfected cell populations. Following plasmid (mRuby) delivery across the BBB with 1 MHz FUS, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to ascertain that distributions of transfected cell types were highly dependent on PNP. Cells of the BBB (i.e., endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes) were enriched at 0.2 MPa PNP, while transfection of cells distal to the BBB (i.e., neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) was augmented at 0.4 MPa PNP. PNP-dependent differential gene expression was observed for multiple cell types. Cell stress genes were upregulated proportional to PNP, independent of cell type. Our results underscore how FUS may be tuned to bias transfection toward specific brain cell types in vivo and predict how those cells will respond to transfection.",0
"The efficacy of many anti-epileptic drugs, including phenytoin (PHT), is reduced by plasma protein binding (PPB) that sequesters therapeutically active drug molecules within the bloodstream. An increase in systemic dose elevates the risk of drug side effects, which demands an alternative technique to increase the unbound concentration of PHT in a region-specific manner. We present a low-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) technique that locally enhances the efficacy of PHT by transiently disrupting its binding to albumin. We first identified the acoustic parameters that yielded the highest PHT unbinding from albumin among evaluated parameter sets using equilibrium dialysis. Then, rats with chronic mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) received four sessions of PHT injection, each followed by 30 min of FUS delivered to the ictal region, across 2 weeks. Two additional groups of mTLE rats underwent the same procedure, but without receiving PHT or FUS. Assessment of electrographic seizure activities revealed that FUS accompanying administration of PHT effectively reduced the number and mean duration of ictal events compared to other conditions, without damaging brain tissue or the blood-brain barrier. Our results demonstrated that the FUS technique enhanced the anti-epileptic efficacy of PHT in a chronic mTLE rodent model by region-specific PPB disruption.",0
"Although ultrasound plays an important role in the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD), image interpretation requires extensive training. High operator variability and limited image quality control of ultrasound images have made the application of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) challenging. This study assessed the effect of integrating computer-extracted measurable features with the convolutional neural network (CNN) on the ultrasound image CAD accuracy of CKD. Ultrasound images from patients who visited Severance Hospital and Gangnam Severance Hospital in South Korea between 2011 and 2018 were used. A Mask regional CNN model was used for organ segmentation and measurable feature extraction. Data on kidney length and kidney-to-liver echogenicity ratio were extracted. The ResNet18 model classified kidney ultrasound images into CKD and non-CKD. Experiments were conducted with and without the input of the measurable feature data. The performance of each model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). A total of 909 patients (mean age, 51.4 ± 19.3 years; 414 [49.5%] men and 495 [54.5%] women) were included in the study. The average AUROC from the model trained using ultrasound images achieved a level of 0.81. Image training with the integration of automatically extracted kidney length and echogenicity features revealed an improved average AUROC of 0.88. This value further increased to 0.91 when the clinical information of underlying diabetes was also included in the model trained with CNN and measurable features. The automated step-wise machine learning-aided model segmented, measured, and classified the kidney ultrasound images with high performance. The integration of computer-extracted measurable features into the machine learning model may improve CKD classification.

"Modern transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound is an incisionless, ablative treatment modality for a growing number of neurologic disorders. This procedure selectively destroys a targeted volume of cerebral tissue and relies on real-time MR thermography to monitor tissue temperatures. By focusing on a submillimeter target through a hemispheric phased array of transducers, ultrasound waves pass through the skull and avoid overheating and brain damage. High-intensity focused ultrasound techniques are increasingly used to create safe and effective stereotactic ablations for medication-refractory movement and other neurologic and psychiatric disorders.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Thalamotomy at the nucleus ventralis intermedius using MR-guided focused ultrasound has been an effective treatment method for essential tremor (ET). However, this is not true for all cases, even for successful ablation. How the brain differs in patients with ET between those with long-term good and poor outcomes is not clear. To analyze the functional connectivity difference between patients in whom thalamotomy was effective and those in whom thalamotomy was ineffective and its prognostic role in ET treatment, the authors evaluated preoperative resting-state functional MRI in thalamotomy-treated patients. METHODS: Preoperative resting-state functional MRI data in 85 patients with ET, who were experiencing tremor relief at the time of treatment and were followed up for a minimum of 6 months after the procedure, were collected for the study. The authors conducted a graph independent component analysis of the functional connectivity matrices of tremor-related networks. The patients were divided into thalamotomy-effective and thalamotomy-ineffective groups (thalamotomy-effective group, ≥ 50% motor symptom reduction; thalamotomy-ineffective group, < 50% motor symptom reduction at 6 months after treatment) and the authors compared network components between groups. RESULTS: Seventy-two (84.7%) of the 85 patients showed ≥ 50% tremor reduction from baseline at 6 months after thalamotomy. The network analysis shows significant suppression of functional network components with connections between the areas of the cerebellum and the basal ganglia and thalamus, but enhancement of those between the premotor cortex and supplementary motor area in the noneffective group compared to the effective group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that patients in the noneffective group have suppressed functional subnetworks in the cerebellum and subcortex regions and have enhanced functional subnetworks among motor-sensory cortical networks compared to the thalamotomy-effective group. Therefore, the authors suggest that the functional connectivity pattern might be a possible predictive factor for outcomes of MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy.",0
"BACKGROUND: Liposuction, the most common body sculpting surgical procedure known today is associated with the risk of numerous complications. A safer and more noninvasive approach involves the use of high-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU) lasers, which work by selectively damaging fat tissue through apoptosis or necrosis induction of fat cells. The authors' systematic review was designed to identify the effectiveness of HIFU for nonsurgical facial and body contouring. METHODS: An exhaustive literature search was conducted of the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Scopus, and EBSCO electronic databases for the period from November of 2005 to July of 2020. The full text of selected articles was reviewed for possible study inclusion, and articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria were recruited. Characteristics of the included studies were noted, and outcomes were assessed. Assessment of quality and risk of bias was performed for all the studies using the RevMan tool and the methodological index for nonrandomized studies. RESULTS: The initial search revealed a total of 4584 citations, of which only 11 were included in the present review: nine used HIFU for recontouring of the abdomen and only two used HIFU over the face and neck. Studies evaluated either the efficacy of HIFU or the safety of its use. The average total energy ranged from 140 to 248 J/cm 2 for the abdominal region and 0.3 to 1.2 J/cm 2 for the face and neck. The focal depth ranged from 1.1 to 1.8 cm. All the studies showed promising results with the use of HIFU. CONCLUSION: HIFU therapy is safe, effective, and minimally invasive, with predictable results when used for body and facial recontouring.",0
"Ultrasound imaging is regarded as a highly sensitive imaging modality used in routine clinical examinations. Over the last several decades, ultrasound contrast agents have been widely applied in ultrasound molecular cancer imaging to improve the detection, characterization, and quantification of tumors. To date, a few new potential preclinical and clinical applications regarding ultrasound molecular cancer imaging are being investigated. This review presents an overview of the various kinds of ultrasound contrast agents employed in ultrasound molecular imaging and advanced imaging techniques using these contrast agents. Additionally, we discuss the recent enormous development of ultrasound contrast agents in the relevant preclinical and clinical applications, highlight the recent challenges which need to be overcome to accelerate the clinical translation, and discuss the future perspective of ultrasound molecular cancer imaging using various contrast agents. As a highly promising and valuable tumor-specific imaging technique, it is believed that ultrasound molecular imaging will pave an accurate and efficient way for cancer diagnosis.",0
"INTRODUCTION: Cerebral diseases have been threatening public physical and psychological health in the recent years. With the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), it is particularly hard for therapeutic proteins like peptides, enzymes, antibodies, etc. to enter the central nervous system (CNS) and function in diagnosis and treatment in cerebral diseases. Fortunately, the past decade has witnessed some emerging strategies of delivering macromolecular therapeutic proteins across the BBB. AREAS COVERED: Based on the structure, functions, and substances transport mechanisms, various enhanced delivery strategies of therapeutic proteins were reviewed, categorized by molecule-mediated delivery strategies, carrier-mediated delivery strategies, and other delivery strategies. EXPERT OPINION: As for molecule-mediated delivery strategies, development of genetic engineering technology, optimization of protein expression and purification techniques, and mature of quality control systems all help to realize large-scale production of recombinant antibodies, making it possible to apply to the clinical practice. In terms of carrier-mediated delivery strategies and others, although nano-carriers/adeno-associated virus (AAV) are also promising candidates for delivering therapeutic proteins or genes across the BBB, some issues still remain to be further investigated, including safety concerns related to applied materials, large-scale production costs, quality control standards, combination therapies with auxiliary delivery strategies like focused ultrasound, etc.",0
"The therapeutic potential of many gene therapies is limited by their inability to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). While intranasal administration of plasmid DNA nanoparticles (NPs) offers a non-invasive approach to bypass the BBB, it is not targeted to disease-relevant brain regions. Here, our goal was to determine whether focused ultrasound (FUS) can enrich intranasal delivery of our plasmid DNA NPs to target deeper brain regions, in this case the regions most affected in Parkinson's disease. Combining FUS with intranasal administration resulted in enhanced delivery of DNA NPs to the rodent brain, by recruitment and transfection of microglia. FUS increased transgene expression by over 3-fold after intranasal administration compared to intravenous administration. Additionally, FUS with intranasal delivery increased transgene expression in the sonicated hemisphere by over 80%, altered cellular transfection patterns at the sonication sites, and improved penetration of plasmid NPs into the brain parenchyma (with a 1-fold and 3-fold increase in proximity of transgene expression to neurons in the forebrain and midbrain respectively, and a 40% increase in proximity of transgene expression to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra). These results provide evidence in support of using FUS to improve transgene expression after intranasal delivery of non-viral gene therapies.",0
"PURPOSE: To predict the efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation for uterine leiomyomas based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indicators and imaging features. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with 85 uterine leiomyomas were consecutively enrolled in this retrospective study and underwent DTI scanning before HIFU treatment. Based on whether the non-perfused volume ratio (NPVR) was greater than 70%, all patients were assigned to sufficient ablation (NPVR ≥ 70%) or insufficient ablation (NPVR < 70%) groups. The selected DTI indicators and imaging features were incorporated to construct a combined model. The predictive performance of DTI indicators and the combined model were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: There were 42 leiomyomas in the sufficient ablation group (NPVR ≥ 70%) and 43 leiomyomas in the insufficient ablation group (NPVR < 70%). The fractional anisotropy (FA) and relative anisotropy (RA) values were higher in the sufficient ablation group than in the insufficient ablation group (p < 0.05). Conversely, the volume ratio (VR) and mean diffusivity (MD) values were lower in the sufficient ablation group than those in the insufficient ablation group (p < 0.05). Notably, the combined model composed of the RA and enhancement degree values had high predictive efficiency, with an AUC of 0.915. The combined model demonstrated higher predictive performance than FA and MD alone (p = 0.032 and p < 0.001, respectively) but showed no significant improvement compared with RA and VR (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: DTI indicators, especially the combined model incorporating DTI indicators and imaging features, can be a promising imaging tool to assist clinicians in predicting HIFU efficacy for uterine leiomyomas.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Herein, a user-friendly software platform for 3-dimensional Focused Ultrasound treatment planning based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images is presented. METHODS: The software directly retrieves and loads MRI images. Various design tools can be used on the MRI images to define the treatment area and the sonication parameters. Based on the treatment plan, the software controls the robotic motion and motion pattern of Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) robotic systems to execute the treatment procedure. Real-time treatment monitoring is achieved through MRI images and thermometry. The software's functionality and performance were evaluated in both laboratory and MRI environments. Different treatment plans were designed on MRI images and sonications were executed on agar-based phantoms and polymer films. RESULTS: Magnetic Resonance (MR) thermometry maps were acquired in the agar-based phantoms. An exceptional agreement was observed between the software-planned treatment area and the lesions produced on the polymer films. CONCLUSIONS: The developed software was successfully integrated with the MRI and robotic system controls for performing accurate treatment planning and real-time monitoring during sonications. The software provides an extremely user-friendly interface, while in the future it could be enhanced by providing dynamic modulation of the ultrasonic parameters during the treatment process.",0
"This study describes the development of an ultrasound-responsive polymer system that provides on-demand degradation when exposed to high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Diels-Alder cycloadducts were used to crosslink polycaprolactone (PCL) polymers and underwent a retro Diels-Alder reaction when stimulated with HIFU. Two Diels-Alder polymer compositions were explored to evaluate the link between reverse reaction energy barriers and polymer degradation rates. PCL crosslinked with isosorbide was also used as a non-Diels-Alder-based control polymer. An increase of HIFU exposure time and amplitude correlated with an increase of PCL degradation for Diels-Alder-based polymers. Ultrasound imaging during HIFU allowed for real-time visualization of the on-demand degradation through cavitation-based mechanisms. The temperature surrounding the sample was monitored with a thermocouple during HIFU stimulation; a minimal increase in temperature was observed. PCL polymers were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), optical profilometry, and mechanical testing. PCL degradation byproducts were identified by mass spectrometry, and their cytocompatibility was evaluated in vitro. Overall, this study demonstrated that HIFU is an effective image-guided, external stimulus to control the degradation of Diels-Alder-based PCL polymers on-demand.",0
"PURPOSE: In older patients who do not wish to undergo watchful waiting, focal therapy could be an alternative to the more morbid radical treatment. We evaluated the role of focal therapy in patients 70 years and older as an alternative management modality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 649 patients across 11 UK sites receiving focal high-intensity focused ultrasound or cryotherapy between June 2006 and July 2020 reported within the UK-based HEAT (HIFU Evaluation and Assessment of Treatment) and ICE (International Cryotherapy Evaluation) registries were evaluated. Primary outcome was failure-free survival, defined by need for more than 1 focal reablation, progression to radical treatment, development of metastases, need for systemic treatment, or prostate cancer-specific death. This was compared to the failure-free survival in patients undergoing radical treatment via a propensity score weighted analysis. RESULTS: Median age was 74 years (IQR: 72, 77) and median follow-up 24 months (IQR: 12, 41). Sixty percent had intermediate-risk disease and 35% high-risk disease. A total of 113 patients (17%) required further treatment. Sixteen had radical treatment and 44 required systemic treatment. Failure-free survival was 82% (95% CI: 76%-87%) at 5 years. Comparing patients who had radical therapy to those who had focal therapy, 5-year failure-free survival was 96% (95% CI: 93%-100%) and 82% (95% CI: 75%-91%) respectively (P < .001). Ninety-three percent of those in the radical treatment arm had received radiotherapy as their primary treatment with its associated use of androgen deprivation therapy, thereby leading to potential overestimation of treatment success in the radical treatment arm, especially given the similar metastases-free and overall survival rates seen. CONCLUSIONS: We propose focal therapy to be an effective management option for the older or comorbid patient who is unsuitable for or not willing to undergo radical treatment.",0
"Calcineurin inhibitor-related tremors occur in up to 50% of solid organ transplant recipients and are disabling in severe cases. We describe a bilateral lung transplant recipient with essential tremors that significantly worsened after tacrolimus initiation. She did not have improvement with the change to extended-release tacrolimus, the use of everolimus as a calcineurin inhibitor-sparing agent, or the addition of primidone, clonazepam, or propranolol. She underwent magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy with significant improvement in her tremor and activities of daily living.",0
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising non-invasive therapeutic technique in clinical applications. Challenges in stimulation or ablation HIFU therapy are to accurately target the treatment spot, flexibly deliver or fast-move focus points in the treatment region, and monitor therapy progress in real-time. In this paper, we develop an array-based HIFU system integrated with real-time ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. The array-based HIFU transducer can be dynamically focused in a lateral range of ∼16 mm and an axial range of ∼40 mm via electronically adjusting the excitation phase map. To monitor the HIFU therapy progress in real-time, sequential HIFU transmission, PA imaging, PA thermometry, and US imaging are implemented to display the dual-modal images and record the local temperature changes. Co-registered dual-modal images show structural and functional information and thus can guide the HIFU therapy for precise positioning and dosage control. Besides therapy, the multi-element HIFU transducer can also be used to acquire US images to precisely align the imaging coordinates with the HIFU coordinates. Phantom experiments validate the precise and dynamic steering capability of HIFU ablation. We also show that dual-modal imaging can guide HIFU in the designated region and monitor the temperature in biological tissue in real-time.",0
"Despite the wide availability of ultrasound machines for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance, an inadequate number of expert radiologists performing ultrasounds in remote areas remains a primary barrier for surveillance. We demonstrated feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) to aid in the detection of focal liver lesions (FLLs) during ultrasound. An AI system for FLL detection in ultrasound videos was developed. Data in this study were prospectively collected at a university hospital. We applied a two-step training strategy for developing the AI system by using a large collection of ultrasound snapshot images and frames from full-length ultrasound videos. Detection performance of the AI system was evaluated and then compared to detection performance by 25 physicians including 16 non-radiologist physicians and 9 radiologists. Our dataset contained 446 videos (273 videos with 387 FLLs and 173 videos without FLLs) from 334 patients. The videos yielded 172,035 frames with FLLs and 1,427,595 frames without FLLs for training on the AI system. The AI system achieved an overall detection rate of 89.8% (95%CI: 84.5–95.0) which was significantly higher than that achieved by non-radiologist physicians (29.1%, 95%CI: 21.2–37.0, p < 0.001) and radiologists (70.9%, 95%CI: 63.0–78.8, p < 0.001). Median false positive detection rate by the AI system was 0.7% (IQR: 1.3%). AI system operation speed reached 30–34 frames per second, showing real-time feasibility. A further study to demonstrate whether the AI system can assist operators during ultrasound examinations is warranted.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Nakagami imaging is an appealing monitoring and evaluation technique for high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment when bubbles are present in ultrasound images. This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of thermal lesion detection using Nakagami imaging. METHODS: Simulations were conducted to explore and quantify the influence of the bubbles and the subresolvable effect at the boundary of the thermal lesion on thermal lesion detection. The thermal ablation experiments were conducted in phantom and porcine liver ex vivo. RESULTS: In the simulation, the estimated lateral and axial size of the thermal lesion in the Nakagami image was 4.91 and 4.79 mm, close to the actual size (5 × 5 mm). The simulation results indicated that the subresolvable region in high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment thermal ablation mainly happened at the boundary between bubbles and the untreated region and does not affect the accuracy of thermal lesion detection. The accurate detection of the thermal lesion using Nakagami imaging mainly depends on bubbles and thermal lesion characterization. Our thermal ablation experiments confirmed that Nakagami imaging has the ability to accurately identify thermal lesions from bubbles. CONCLUSION: The subresolvable effect is helpful for thermal lesion identification, and precision is related to the Nakagami values chosen for boundary division in Nakagami imaging. Therefore, Nakagami imaging is a promising method for accurately evaluating thermal lesions. Further studies in vivo and in clinical settings will be needed to explore its potential applications.",0
"BACKGROUND: The size of catheter-based ultrasound devices for delivering ultrasound energy to deep-seated tumors is constrained by the access pathway which limits their therapeutic capabilities. PURPOSE: To devise and investigate a deployable applicator suitable for minimally-invasive delivery of therapeutic ultrasound, consisting of a 2D cylindrical sectored-ring ultrasound phased array, integrated within an expandable paraboloid-shaped balloon-based reflector. The balloon can be collapsed for compact delivery and expanded close to the target position to mimic a larger-diameter concentric-ring sector-vortex array for enhanced dynamic control of focal depth and volume. METHODS: Acoustic and biothermal simulations were employed in 3D generalized homogeneous and patient-specific heterogeneous models, for three-phased array transducers with 32, 64, and 128 elements, composed of sectored 4, 8, and 16 tubular ring transducers, respectively. The applicator performance was characterized as a function of array configuration, focal depth, phasing modes, and balloon reflector geometry. A 16-element proof-of-concept phased array applicator assembly, consisting of four tubular transducers each divided into four sectors, was fabricated, and characterized with hydrophone measurements along and across the axis, and ablations in ex vivo tissue. RESULTS: Simulation results indicated that transducer arrays (1.5 MHz, 9 mm OD × 20 mm long), balloon sizes (41-50 mm expanded diameter, 20-60 mm focal depth), phasing mode (0-4) and sonication duration (30 s) can produce spatially localized acoustic intensity focal patterns (focal length: 3-22 mm, focal width: 0.7-8.7 mm) and ablative thermal lesions (width: 2.7-16 mm, length: 6-46 mm) in pancreatic tissue across a 10-90 mm focal depth range. Patient-specific studies indicated that 0.1, 0.46, and 1.2 cm3 volume of tumor can be ablated in the body of the pancreas for 120 s sonications using a single axial focus (Mode 0), or four, and eight simultaneous foci in a toroidal pattern (Mode 2 and 4, respectively). Hydrophone measurements demonstrated good agreement with simulation. Experiments in which chicken meat was thermally ablated indicated that volumetric ablation can be produced using single or multiple foci. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of a novel compact ultrasound applicator design capable of focusing, deep penetration, electronic steering, and volumetric thermal ablation. The proposed applicator can be used for compact endoluminal or laparoscopic delivery of localized ultrasound energy to deep-seated targets.",0
"We investigate the role of leaky guided waves in transcranial ultrasound transmission in temporal and parietal bones at large incidence angles. Our numerical and experimental results show that the dispersion characteristics of the fundamental leaky guided wave mode with longitudinal polarization can be leveraged to estimate the critical angle above which efficient shear mode conversion takes place, and below which major transmission drops can be expected. Simulations that employ a numerical propagator matrix and a Semi-Analytical approach establish the transcranial dispersion characteristics and transmission coefficients at different incident angles. Experimental transmission tests conducted at 500 kHz and radiation tests performed in the 200-800 kHz range confirm the numerical findings in terms of transmitted peak pressure and frequency-radiation angle spectra, based on which the connection between critical angles, dispersion and transmission is demonstrated. Our results support the identification of transcranial ultrasound strategies that leverage shear mode conversion, which is less sensitive to phase aberrations compared to normal incidence ultrasound. These findings can also enable higher transmission rates in cranial bones with low porosity by leveraging dispersion information extracted through signal processing, without requiring measurement of geometric and mechanical properties of the cranial bone.",0
"Several therapeutic agents for neurological disorders are usually not delivered to the brain owing to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a special structure present in the central nervous system (CNS). Focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles can reversibly and temporarily open the BBB, enabling the application of various therapeutic agents in patients with neurological disorders. In the past 20 years, many preclinical studies on drug delivery through FUS-mediated BBB opening have been conducted, and the use of this method in clinical applications has recently gained popularity. As the clinical application of FUS-mediated BBB opening expands, it is crucial to understand the molecular and cellular effects of FUS-induced microenvironmental changes in the brain so that the efficacy of treatment can be ensured, and new treatment strategies established. This review describes the latest research trends in FUS-mediated BBB opening, including the biological effects and applications in representative neurological disorders, and suggests future directions.",0
"The last two decades have seen dramatic growth in the application of procedurally based interventions for treating refractory psychiatric conditions, leading to interest in developing the foundations for the subspecialty of ""Interventional Psychiatry."" However, there is cause for concern that the rate of expansion of clinical advances in this field may be outpacing the ability of postgraduate curricula to provide sufficient exposure to and teaching and supervision of these treatments. The paucity of adequately trained practitioners in Interventional Psychiatry further exacerbates inequities in the ability of eligible patients to access and benefit from these approaches. This paper explores the rates of utilization of Interventional Psychiatry treatments, the current state of education in these treatments, and the role that training can play in translating scientific advances in this area to ensure equitable access and maximum impact at a population level. The majority of the discussion is centered on electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the most established and available of these treatments, highlighting how enhancing education and training in ECT can reduce barriers to its utilization. It is argued that innovations in pedagogical approaches for disseminating the learning of these procedures are needed to increase the current low rates of competency in these treatments and can facilitate the more rapid dissemination of other Interventional Psychiatry approaches and neurotechnologies, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, deep brain stimulation, and focused ultrasound.",0
"TiO2 is the most commonly used photocatalyst in water treatment. The particle size of TiO2 is an important factor that significantly influences its activity during photocatalytic degradation. In the presence of liquid, the properties of nanopowders composed of exactly the same product clearly differ according to their aggregation size. In this study, TiO2 nanoparticles with a controlled size were fabricated by focused ultrasound dispersion. The high energy generated by this system was used to control the size of TiO2 particles in the suspension. The constant high energy released by cavitation enabled the dispersion of the particles without a surfactant. The activities of the prepared TiO2 photocatalysts for methylene blue (MB) degradation were then compared. The dye degradation effect of the photocatalyst was as high as 61.7% after 10 min when the size of the powder was controlled in the solution, but it was only as high as 41.0% when the aggregation size was not controlled. Furthermore, when the TiO2 concentration exceeded a certain level, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 decreased. Controlling the size of the aggregated photocatalyst particles is, therefore, essential in water-treatment technologies utilizing TiO2 photocatalytic properties, and adjusting the TiO2 concentration is an important economic factor in this photocatalytic technology. This study contributes to the development of processes for degrading dyes, such as MB, released from wastewater into aquatic environments.",0
"BACKGROUND: Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a novel non-invasive brain stimulation technique with high depth penetrance and spatial resolution. Theta-burst TUS (tbTUS) is a plasticity-inducing protocol which increases motor cortical excitability for up to 30 min following 80s of sonication. While this protocol may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders, the mechanisms of action of TUS remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We conducted the first pharmacological study to examine the mechanisms of TUS in human primary motor cortex. By administering brain-active drugs with known mechanisms of action, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of tbTUS. METHODS: Fourteen healthy subjects participated in a within-subjects randomized, double-blind, cross-over study with five visits. At each visit, one of four study drugs (carbamazepine - Na+ channel blocker, nimodipine - L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, lorazepam - positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor, dextromethorphan - N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist) or placebo was administered in random order, followed by tbTUS. RESULTS: The plasticity effects of tbTUS on motor cortex excitability measured by motor-evoked potential amplitudes elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation were reduced by all study drugs compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: tbTUS may induce NMDA-dependent synaptic plasticity since the effects are blocked by increased GABAA receptor activities and voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels blockers. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that tbTUS induced long-term potentiation-like mechanisms and that TUS involves activation of mechanosensitive Na+ and Ca2+ channels. Alternatively, non-specific pharmacologically induced changes in excitatory/inhibitory balance might have interfered with the effects of tbTUS.",0
"Focused ultrasound (FUS) can be used to physiologically change or destroy tissue in a non-invasive way. A few commercial systems have clinical approval for the thermal ablation of solid tumors for the treatment of neurological diseases and palliative pain management of bone metastases. However, the thermal effects of FUS are known to lead to various biological effects, such as inhibition of repair of DNA damage, reduction in tumor hypoxia, and induction of apoptosis. Here, we studied radiosensitization as a combination therapy of FUS and RT in a xenograft mouse model using newly developed MRI-compatible FUS equipment. Xenograft tumor-bearing mice were produced by subcutaneous injection of the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Animals were treated with FUS in 7 T MRI at 4.8 W/cm2 to reach ~45 °C and held for 30 min. The temperature was controlled via fiber optics and proton resonance frequency shift (PRF) MR thermometry in parallel. In the combination group, animals were treated with FUS followed by X-ray at a single dose of 10 Gy. The effects of FUS and RT were assessed via hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Tumor proliferation was detected by the immunohistochemistry of Ki67 and apoptosis was measured by a TUNEL assay. At 40 days follow-up, the impact of RT on cancer cells was significantly improved by FUS as demonstrated by a reduction in cell nucleoli from 189 to 237 compared to RT alone. Inhibition of tumor growth by 4.6 times was observed in vivo in the FUS + RT group (85.3%) in contrast to the tumor volume of 393% in the untreated control. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of combined MRI-guided FUS and RT for the treatment of prostate cancer in a xenograft mouse model and may provide a chance for less invasive cancer therapy through radiosensitization.",0
"PURPOSE: To describe the national-level patterns of care for local ablative therapy among men with PCa and identify patient- and hospital-level factors associated with the receipt of these techniques. METHODS: We retrospectively interrogated the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for men with clinically localized PCa between 2010 and 2017. The main outcome was receipt of local tumor ablation with either cryo- or laser-ablation, and ""other method of local tumor destruction including high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)"". Patient level, hospital level, and demographic variables were collected. Mixed effect logistic regression models were fitted to identify separately patient- and hospital-level predictors of receipt of local ablative therapy. RESULTS: Overall, 11,278 patients received ablative therapy, of whom 78.8% had cryotherapy, 15.6% had laser, and 5.7% had another method including HIFU. At the patient level, men with intermediate-risk PCa were more likely to be treated with local ablative therapy (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.00-1.11; p = 0.05), as were men with Charlson Comorbidity Index > 1 (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.29-1.43; p < 0.01), men between 71 and 80 years (OR 3.70; 95% CI 3.43-3.99; p < 0.01), men with Medicare insurance (OR 1.38; 95% 1.31-1.46; p < 0.01), and an income < $47,999 (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.06-1.21; p < 0.01). At the hospital-level, local ablative therapy was less likely to be performed in academic/research facilities (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.32-0.64; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Local ablative therapy for PCa treatment is more commonly offered among older and comorbid patients. Future studies should investigate the uptake of these technologies in non-hospital-based settings and in light of recent changes in insurance coverage.",0
"Horner's syndrome (HS), caused by lesions of the 3-neuron oculosympathetic nerve pathway (ONP), includes the triad: blepharoptosis, miosis and anhidrosis (ipsilateral with ONP damage). Thyroid-related HS represents an unusual entity underling thyroid nodules/goiter/cancer-HS (T-HS), and post-thyroidectomy HS (Tx-HS). We aim to overview Tx-HS. This is a narrative review. We revised PubMed published, full-length, English papers from inception to November 2022. Additionally, we introduced data on post-thyroidectomy lymphocele/chylous leakage (Tx-L), and introduced a new pediatric case with both Tx-HS and Tx-L. Tx-HS: the level of statistical evidence varies from isolated case reports, studies analyzing the large panel of post-thyroidectomy complications reporting HS among the rarest side effects (as opposite to hypocalcemia), or different series of patients with HS due to various disorders, including T-HS/Tx-HS. Tx-HS is related to benign or malignant thyroid conditions, regardless the type of surgery. A pre-operatory rate of T-HS of 0.14%; a post-operatory rate of Tx-HS between 0.03% and 5% (mostly, 0.2%) are identified; a possible higher risk on endoscopic rather than open procedure is described. Incomplete HS forms, and pediatric onset are identified, too; the earliest identification is after 2 h since intervention. A progressive remission is expected in most cases within the first 2-6 months to one year. The management is mostly conservative; some used glucocorticoids and neurotrophic agents. One major pitfall is an additional contributor factor like a local compression due to post-operatory collections (hematoma, cysts, fistula, Tx-L) and their correction improves the outcome. The prognostic probably depends on the severity of cervical sympathetic chain (CSC) lesions: indirect, mild injury due to local compressive masses, intra-operatory damage of CSC like ischemia and stretching of CSC by the retractor associate HS recovery, while CSC section is irreversible. Other iatrogenic contributors to HS are: intra-operatory manipulation of parathyroid glands, thyroid microwave/radiofrequency ablation, and high-intensity focused ultrasound, and percutaneous ethanol injection into thyroid nodules. Tx-L, rarely reported (mostly &lt;0.5%, except for a ratio of 8.3% in one study), correlates with extended surgery, especially lateral/central neck dissection, and the presence of congenitally-aberrant lymphatic duct; it is, also, described after endoscopic procedures and chest-breast approach; it starts within days after surgery. Typically low-fat diet (even fasting and parental nutrition) and tube drainage are useful (as part of conservative management); some used octreotide, local sealing solutions like hypertonic glucose, Viscum album extract, n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. Re-intervention is required in severe cases due to the risk of lymphorrhoea and chylothorax. Early identification of Tx-HS and Tx-L improves the outcome. Some iatrogenic complications are inevitable and a multifactorial model of prediction is still required, also taking into consideration standardized operatory procedures, skillful intra-operatory manipulation, and close post-operatory follow-up of the patients, especially during modern era when thyroid surgery registered a massive progress allowing an early discharge of the patients.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to ascertain the finding of future diagnosis of malignancy in women who undergo non-surgical treatment for uterine fibroid disease with Interventional Radiology (IR) procedures. DESIGN: Mixed methods retrospective cohort study PATIENTS: 491 women who underwent radiologic intervention for fibroids between 2006 and 2016 at two tertiary care academic hospitals in Boston, MA. EXPOSURE: Uterine artery embolization (UAE) or high intensity focused ultrasound ablation (HIFU) MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subsequent surgical interventions and diagnosis of gynecologic malignancy following IR procedure RESULTS: During the study period, 491 women underwent treatment of fibroids with IR procedures; follow-up information was available for 346 cases. The mean age was 45.3 ± 4.8 years and 69.7% were between 40 to 49 years old. Regarding ethnicity, 58.9% of patients were white and 26.1% Black. The most common symptoms were: abnormal uterine bleeding (87%), pelvic pressure (62.3%) and pelvic pain (60.9%). A total of 106 patients underwent subsequent surgical treatment of fibroids. Out of the 346 patients who had follow-up, four were diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma following their interventional treatment for fibroids (1.2%). An additional two cases of endometrial adenocarcinoma and one case of a premalignant lesion of the endometrium were noted. CONCLUSION: The proportion of patients who went on to be diagnosed with LMS following conservative IR treatments appears to be higher than previously reported. A thorough pre-procedural workup and patient counseling regarding the possibility of underlying uterine malignancy must be undertaken.",0
"The effects of transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex and its thalamic projection (i.e., ventral posterolateral nucleus) on the generation of electroencephalographic (EEG) responses were evaluated in healthy human volunteers. Stimulation of the unilateral somatosensory circuits corresponding to the non-dominant hand generated EEG evoked potentials across all participants; however, not all perceived stimulation-mediated tactile sensations of the hand. These FUS-evoked EEG potentials (FEP) were observed from both brain hemispheres and shared similarities with somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) from median nerve stimulation. Use of a 0.5 ms pulse duration (PD) sonication given at 70% duty cycle, compared to the use of 1 and 2 ms PD, elicited more distinctive FEP peak features from the hemisphere ipsilateral to sonication. Although several participants reported hearing tones associated with FUS stimulation, the observed FEP were not likely to be confounded by the auditory sensation based on a separate measurement of auditory evoked potentials (AEP) to tonal stimulation (mimicking the same repetition frequency as the FUS stimulation). Off-line changes in resting-state functional connectivity (FC) associated with thalamic stimulation revealed that the FUS stimulation enhanced connectivity in a network of sensorimotor and sensory integration areas, which lasted for at least more than an hour. Clinical neurological evaluations, EEG, and neuroanatomical MRI did not reveal any adverse or unintended effects of sonication, attesting its safety. These results suggest that FUS stimulation may induce long-term neuroplasticity in humans, indicating its neurotherapeutic potential for various neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions.",0
"Background: Focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening is a noninvasive, safe and reversible technique for targeted drug delivery to the brain. Most preclinical systems developed to perform and monitor BBB opening are comprised of a separate geometrically focused transducer and passive cavitation detector (PCD) or imaging array. This study builds upon previous work from our group developing a single imaging phased array configuration for simultaneous BBB opening and monitoring called theranostic ultrasound (ThUS), leveraging ultra-short pulse lengths (USPLs) and a novel rapid alternating steering angles (RASTA) pulse sequence design for simultaneous bilateral sonications with target-specific USPL. The RASTA sequence was further employed to evaluate the impact of USPL on BBB opening volume, power cavitation imaging (PCI) pixel intensity, BBB closing timeline, drug delivery efficiency, and safety. Methods: A P4-1 phased array transducer driven by a Verasonics Vantage ultrasound system was operated using a custom script to run the RASTA sequence which consisted of interleaved steered, focused transmits and passive imaging. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed initial opening volume and closure of the BBB by longitudinal imaging through 72 hours post-BBB opening. For drug delivery experiments, mice were systemically administered a 70 kDa fluorescent dextran or adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) for fluorescence microscopy or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to evaluate ThUS-mediated molecular therapeutic delivery. Additional brain sections were also H&E-stained to evaluate histological damage, and IBA1- and GFAP-stained to elucidate the effects of ThUS-mediated BBB opening on stimulation of key cell types involved in the neuro-immune response, microglia and astrocytes. Results: The ThUS RASTA sequence induced distinct BBB openings simultaneously in the same mouse where volume, PCI pixel intensity, level of dextran delivery, and AAV reporter transgene expression were correlated with brain hemisphere-specific USPL, consistent with statistically significant differences between 1.5, 5, and 10-cycle USPL groups. BBB closure after ThUS required 2-48 hours depending on USPL. The potential for acute damage and neuro-immune activation increased with USPL, but such observable damage was nearly reversed 96 hours post-ThUS. Conclusion: ThUS is a versatile single-array technique which exhibits the potential for investigating a variety of non-invasive therapeutic delivery applications in the brain.",0
"A Sonalleve magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) clinical system (Profound Medical, Mississauga, ON, Canada) has been shown to generate nonlinear ultrasound fields with shocks up to 100 MPa at the focus as required for HIFU applications such as boiling histotripsy of hepatic and renal tumors. The Sonalleve system has two versions V1 and V2 of the therapeutic array, with differences in focusing angle, focus depth, arrangement of elements, and the size of a central opening that is twice larger in the V2 system compared to the V1. The goal of this study was to compare the performance of the V1 and V2 transducers for generating high-amplitude shock-wave fields and to reveal the impact of different array geometries on shock amplitudes at the focus. Nonlinear modeling of the field in water using boundary conditions reconstructed from holography measurements shows that at the same power output, the V2 array generates 10-15-MPa lower shock amplitudes at the focus. Consequently, substantially higher power levels are required for the V2 system to reach the same shock-wave exposure conditions in histotripsy-type treatments. Although this difference is mainly caused by the smaller focusing angle of the V2 array, the larger central opening of the V2 array has a nontrivial impact. By excluding coherently interacting weakly focused waves coming from the central part of the source, the presence of the central opening results in a somewhat higher effective focusing angle and thus higher shock amplitudes at the focus. Axisymmetric equivalent source models were constructed for both arrays, and the importance of including the central opening was demonstrated. These models can be used in the ""HIFU beam"" software for simulating nonlinear fields of the Sonalleve V1 and V2 systems in water and flat-layered biological tissues.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Ultrasound-mediated cavitation has been harnessed to improve the delivery of various therapeutics, including the extravasation of small molecule drugs and nanoparticles (<1 µm) into soft tissue. This study investigated whether cavitation could also enhance the extravasation of larger (>10 µm) therapeutic particles, representative of radio- or chemo-embolic particles, in a tissue-mimicking phantom. METHODS: High-speed (103-106 frames/s) optical imaging was used to observe the motion of glass microspheres with diameters of 15-32 or 105-107 µm in an agar phantom under exposure to high-intensity focused ultrasound (0.5 MHz) at a range of peak negative pressures (1.9-2.8 MPa) in the presence of SonoVue microbubbles. RESULTS: In contrast to the microstreaming reported to be responsible for nanoparticle transport, the formation and translation of bubble clouds were found to be primarily responsible for the motion of glass microspheres. The bubble clouds were seen both to create channels in the phantom and to travel along them under the action of primary acoustic radiation force, either propelling or entraining microspheres with them. Collisions between microspheres were also seen to promote cloud formation and cavitation activity. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-mediated cavitation can promote the transport of solid microparticles in tissue-mimicking material. Further work is needed to understand the influence of tissue mechanical properties and ultrasound exposure parameters on the extent and uniformity of particle distribution that can be achieved.",0
"BACKGROUND: Regional differences in gray matter volume (GMV) have been reported to be a reliable marker for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to explore the clinical value of GMV to assess magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy as a treatment for tremor-dominant PD (TDPD). METHODS: Nine TDPD patients with MRgFUS thalamotomy were recruited for structural magnetic resonance image (MRI) scanning and clinical score evaluation. GMV was calculated. To investigate changes after treatment, voxel- and region of interest (ROI)-wise GMV analyses were performed. Then, GMV with significant differences was extracted from patients to investigate its dynamic alterations by one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The nonparametric Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between GMV alterations and tremor improvement after thalamotomy. RESULTS: Tremors were significantly relieved after MRgFUS thalamotomy in nine patients (P<0.05). The treated hand tremor scores improved 74.82% on average in patients from pre-operation to 12 months post-operation. Voxel-wise analysis at the cluster level showed a significant decrease in GMV in the left middle occipital gyrus (MOG) [t=11.81, voxel-level P<0.001, cluster-level Pfamily-wise error (FWE) <0.05] and an increase in GMV in the left precentral gyrus (PreCG) (t=7.99, voxel-level P<0.001, cluster-level PFWE <0.05) in TDPD patients from preoperative to 12 months post-operation, which was significantly correlated with tremor scores (rho =0.346-0.439, P<0.05). ROI-wise analysis showed that GMV related to MRgFUS thalamotomy was associated with long-term structural alterations (P<0.05 with Bonferroni correction), including specific basal ganglia and related nuclei and cerebellum subregions. CONCLUSIONS: GMV can be used to reflect tremor improvement after MRgFUS thalamotomy and be helpful to better understand the distant effect of MRgFUS thalamotomy and the involvement of GMV in tremor control in TDPD.

"Optogenetics has revolutionized neuroscience understanding by allowing spatiotemporal control over cell-type specific neurons in neural circuits. However, the sluggish development of noninvasive photon delivery in the brain has limited the clinical application of optogenetics. Focused ultrasound (FUS)-derived mechanoluminescence has emerged as a promising tool for in situ photon emission, but there is not yet a biocompatible liquid-phase mechanoluminescence system for spatiotemporal optogenetics. To achieve noninvasive optogenetics with a high temporal resolution and desirable biocompatibility, we have developed liposome (Lipo@IR780/L012) nanoparticles for FUS-triggered mechanoluminescence in brain photon delivery. Synchronized and stable blue light emission was generated in solution under FUS irradiation due to the cascade reactions in liposomes. In vitro tests revealed that Lipo@IR780/L012 could be triggered by FUS for light emission at different stimulation frequencies, resulting in activation of opsin-expressing spiking HEK cells under the FUS irradiation. In vivo optogenetic stimulation further demonstrated that motor cortex neurons could be noninvasively and reversibly activated under the repetitive FUS irradiation after intravenous injection of lipid nanoparticles to achieve limb movements.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The ability to predict final lesion characteristics during magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy for the treatment of essential tremor remains technically challenging, yet it is essential in order to avoid off-target ablation and to ensure adequate treatment. The authors sought to evaluate the technical feasibility and utility of intraprocedural diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the prediction of final lesion size and location. METHODS: Lesion diameter and distance from the midline were measured on both intraprocedural and immediate postprocedural diffusion and T2-weighted sequences. Bland-Altman analysis was utilized to determine differences in measurement between intraprocedural and immediate postprocedural images with both sequences. RESULTS: Lesion size increased on both the postprocedural diffusion and T2-weighted sequences, although the difference was smaller on the T2-weighted sequence. There was only a small difference in intraprocedural and postprocedural lesion distance from the midline on both the diffusion and T2-weighted sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Intraprocedural DWI is both feasible and useful with regard to predicting final lesion size and providing an early indication of lesion location. Further research should determine the value of intraprocedural DWI in predicting delayed clinical outcomes.",0
"Therapeutic focused ultrasound in combination with encapsulated microbubbles is being widely investigated for its ability to elicit bioeffects in the microvasculature, such as transient permeabilization for drug delivery or at higher pressures to achieve 'antivascular' effects. While it is well established that the behaviors of microbubbles are altered when they are situated within sufficiently small vessels, there is a paucity of data examining how the bubble population dynamics and emissions change as a function of channel (vessel) diameter over a size range relevant to therapeutic ultrasound, particularly at pressures relevant to antivascular ultrasound. Here we use acoustic emissions detection and high-speed microscopy (10 kframes/s) to examine the behavior of a polydisperse clinically employed agent (Definity®) in wall-less channels as their diameters are scaled from 1200 to 15 µm. Pressures are varied from 0.1 to 3 MPa using either a 5 ms pulse or a sequence of 0.1 ms pulses spaced at 1 ms, both of which have been previously employed in an in vivo context. With increasing pressure, the 1200 µm channel - on the order of small arteries and veins - exhibited inertial cavitation, 1/2 subharmonics and 3/2 ultraharmonics, consistent with numerous previous reports. The 200 and 100 µm channels - in the size range of larger microvessels less affected by therapeutic focused ultrasound - exhibited a distinctly different behavior, having muted development of 1/2 subharmonics and 3/2 ultraharmonics and reduced persistence. These were associated with radiation forces displacing bubbles to the distal wall and inducing clusters that then rapidly dissipated along with emissions. As the diameter transitioned to 50 and then 15 µm - a size regime that is most relevant to therapeutic focused ultrasound - there was a higher threshold for the onset of inertial cavitation as well as subharmonics and ultraharmonics, which importantly had more complex orders that are not normally reported. Clusters also occurred in these channels (e.g. at 3 MPa, the mean lateral and axial sizes were 23 and 72 µm in the 15 µm channel; 50 and 90 µm in the 50 µm channel), however in this case they occupied the entire lumens and displaced the wall boundaries. Damage to the 15 µm channel was observed for both pulse types, but at a lower pressure for the long pulse. Experiments conducted with a 'nanobubble' (<0.45 µm) subpopulation of Definity followed broadly similar features to 'native' Definity, albeit at a higher pressure threshold for inertial cavitation. These results provide new insights into the behavior of microbubbles in small vessels at higher pressures and have implications for therapeutic focused ultrasound cavitation monitoring and control.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the changes of cervical soluble immune markers after focused ultrasound (FU) treatment to explore the underlying local immune effects of FU in the treatment of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection-related low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL). METHODS: A total of 35 patients diagnosed with HR-HPV infection-related histological LSIL who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this prospective study and treated with FU. The authors used cytometric bead array to measure T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine (interleukin [IL] 2, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon γ) and Th2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10) levels in the cervicovaginal lavage of patients before and 3 months after FU treatment. RESULTS: After FU treatment, the concentrations of Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-6 were significantly lower than those before FU treatment (P = 0.044 and P = 0.028, respectively). HR-HPV infection was cleared in 27 patients, with a clearance rate of 77.1% (27 of 35). The concentration of IL-4 in patients with HR-HPV clearance after FU treatment was significantly lower than that in patients without HR-HPV clearance (P = 0.045). CONCLUSION: FU can inhibit the production of certain Th2 cytokines and may improve the local immune status of the cervix, thereby eliminating HR-HPV infection.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an obstacle for molecules to pass through from blood to the brain. Focused ultrasound is a new method which temporarily opens the BBB, which makes pharmaceutical delivery or removal of neurodegenerative proteins possible. This study was demonstrated to review our BBB opening procedure with magnetic resonance guided images and find specific patterns in the BBB opening. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed the procedures and results of two clinical studies on BBB opening using focused ultrasound regarding its safety and clinical efficacy. Magnetic resonance images were also reviewed to discover any specific findings. RESULTS: Two clinical trials showed clinical benefits. All clinical trials demonstrated safe BBB opening, with no specific side effects. Magnetic resonance imaging showed temporary T1 contrast enhancement in the sonication area, verifying the BBB opening. Several low-signal intensity spots were observed in the T2 susceptibility-weighted angiography images, which were also reversible and temporary. Although these spots can be considered as microbleeding, evidence suggests these are not ordinary microbleeding but an indicator for adequate BBB opening. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance images proved safe and efficient BBB opening in humans, using focused ultrasound.",0
"Nano-based drug delivery systems hold significant promise for cancer therapies. Presently, the poor accumulation of drug-carrying nanoparticles in tumors has limited their success. In this study, based on a combination of the paradigms of intravascular and extravascular drug release, an efficient nanosized drug delivery system with programmable size changes is introduced. Drug-loaded smaller nanoparticles (secondary nanoparticles), which are loaded inside larger nanoparticles (primary nanoparticles), are released within the microvascular network due to temperature field resulting from focused ultrasound. This leads to the scale of the drug delivery system decreasing by 7.5 to 150 times. Subsequently, smaller nanoparticles enter the tissue at high transvascular rates and achieve higher accumulation, leading to higher penetration depths. In response to the acidic pH of tumor microenvironment (according to the distribution of oxygen), they begin to release the drug doxorubicin at very slow rates (i.e., sustained release). To predict the performance and distribution of therapeutic agents, a semi-realistic microvascular network is first generated based on a sprouting angiogenesis model and the transport of therapeutic agents is then investigated based on a developed multi-compartment model. The results show that reducing the size of the primary and secondary nanoparticles can lead to higher cell death rate. In addition, tumor growth can be inhibited for a longer time by enhancing the bioavailability of the drug in the extracellular space. The proposed drug delivery system can be very promising in clinical applications. Furthermore, the proposed mathematical model is applicable to broader applications to predict the performance of drug delivery systems.",0
"BACKGROUND: Mechanical waves produced by ultrasound pulses have been shown to activate mechanosensitive ion channels and modulate peripheral nerves. However, while peripheral ultrasound neuromodulation has been demonstrated in vitro and in pre-clinical models, there have been few reports of clinical tests. AIM: We modified a diagnostic imaging system for ultrasound neuromodulation in human subjects. We report the first safety and feasibility outcomes in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and discuss these outcomes in relation to previous pre-clinical results. DESIGN: The study was performed as an open label feasibility study to assess the effects of hepatic ultrasound (targeted to the porta hepatis) on glucometabolic parameters in subjects with T2D. Stimulation (pFUS Treatment) was performed for 3 days (i.e., 15-minutes per day), was preceded by a baseline examination, and followed by a two-week observation period. METHODS: Multiple metabolic assays were employed including measures of fasting glucose and insulin, insulin resistance, and glucose metabolism. The safety and tolerability were also assessed by monitoring adverse events, changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters, and clinical laboratory measures. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We report post-pFUS trends in several outcomes that were consistent with previous pre-clinical findings. Fasting insulin was lowered, resulting in a reduction of HOMA-IR scores (p-value 0.01; corrected Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test). Additional safety and exploratory markers demonstrated no device-related adverse impact of pFUS. Our findings demonstrate that pFUS represents a promising new treatment modality that could be used as a non-pharmaceutical adjunct or even alternative to current drug treatments in diabetes.",0
"PURPOSE: To analyze the predictive value of clinical and ultrasound parameters for treatment failure after administration of methotrexate (MTX) in combination with suction curettage (SC) in treatment of cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) in the early first trimester. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, electronic medical records of patients diagnosed with CSP and initially treated between 2015 and 2022 with MTX combined with SC were reviewed and outcome data were collected. RESULTS: 127 patients met inclusion criteria. 25 (19.69%) required additional treatment. Logistic regression analysis indicated that factors independently associated with the need for additional treatment included progesterone level > 25 mIU/mL (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 0.98-2.87, P = 0.039), abundant blood flow (OR: 5.19; 95% CI: 2.44-16.31, P = 0.011), gestational sac size > 3 cm (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.12-6.87, P = 0.029), and the myometrial thickness between the bladder and gestational sac < 2.5 mm (OR: 3.48; 95% CI: 1.91-6.98, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified several factors which increase the need for additional treatment following the initial treatment of CSP with MTX and SC. Alternative therapy should be considered if these factors are present.",0
"OBJECTIVES: No method is available to determine the non-perfused volume (NPV) repeatedly during magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) ablations of uterine fibroids, as repeated acquisition of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1w) scans is inhibited by safety concerns. The objective of this study was to develop and test a deep learning-based method for translation of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) into synthetic CE-T1w scans, for monitoring MR-HIFU treatment progression. METHODS: The algorithm was retrospectively trained and validated on data from 33 and 20 patients respectively who underwent an MR-HIFU treatment of uterine fibroids between June 2017 and January 2019. Postablation synthetic CE-T1w images were generated by a deep learning network trained on paired DWI and reference CE-T1w scans acquired during the treatment procedure. Quantitative analysis included calculation of the Dice coefficient of NPVs delineated on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans. Four MR-HIFU radiologists assessed the outcome of MR-HIFU treatments and NPV ratio based on the synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans. RESULTS: Dice coefficient of NPVs was 71% (± 22%). The mean difference in NPV ratio was 1.4% (± 22%) and not statistically significant (p = 0.79). Absolute agreement of the radiologists on technical treatment success on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans was 83%. NPV ratio estimations on synthetic and reference CE-T1w scans were not significantly different (p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning-based synthetic CE-T1w scans derived from intraprocedural DWI allow gadolinium-free visualization of the predicted NPV, and can potentially be used for repeated gadolinium-free monitoring of treatment progression during MR-HIFU therapy for uterine fibroids. KEY POINTS: • Synthetic CE-T1w scans can be derived from diffusion-weighted imaging using deep learning. • Synthetic CE-T1w scans may be used for visualization of the NPV without using a contrast agent directly after MR-HIFU ablations of uterine fibroids.",0
"OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative safety and effectiveness of 2 prostate cancer treatment ablation modalities: irreversible electroporation (IRE) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).  METHODS: Two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) on IRE and HIFU were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted in PubMed and EMBASE. Independent reviewers assessed literature eligibility and abstracted safety and effectiveness data. Oncological, safety, functional, and quality of life (QOL) outcomes were examined for each technology. MAs were conducted where data quality and availability allowed, using normal methods and a random/mixed effects model, and quality assessments performed. RESULTS: Fifty-five publications (n = 22 IRE; n = 33 HIFU) were included in the SLRs, and MAs were conducted on negative in-field post-procedure biopsy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level reduction, potency, urinary continence, and AE rate outcomes. MAs revealed that IRE patients had lower mean percent PSA level reductions, higher mean rates of in-field negative post-treatment biopsy, and higher rates of potency maintenance than HIFU patients. Most adverse events (AEs) reported were comparable and minor (Grades I, II), with urinary tract infection, dysuria, hematuria, and incontinence or urgency most frequently reported. The proportion of patients experiencing a severe AE (≥Grade III) ranged from 0 to 8% after IRE and HIFU. Both modalities were associated with positive functional outcomes as well as maintenance of QOL after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both IRE and HIFU were found to produce favorable effectiveness outcomes and have low complication rates while minimally impacting patient urinary and erectile function and maintaining overall QOL. These real-world findings can help guide clinical decision making and improve disease management for patients with prostate cancer.",0
"Sonodynamic therapy has emerged as an encouraging non-invasive technique that uses ultrasound to activate targeted agents to induce anti-tumor effects for the treatment of glioma. With extensive variation in the types of sonosensitizers, protocols for sonication, and model systems, a comprehensive overview of existing pre-clinical data on the efficacy of SDT in glioma treatment is warranted. Here, we conduct a systematic review of pre-clinical and early clinical literature on implementing sonodynamic therapy (SDT) to treat in-vitro and in-vivo models of glioma. Our findings suggest that coupling sonosensitizers such as 5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA), hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) and sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS) with focused ultrasound induces robust cytotoxic activity in tumor cells (in-vitro and in-vivo). These effects are likely mediated by the oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptotic signaling cascades, and intracellular calcium overload. Future research is needed to better understand the biochemical and mechanistic properties of sonodynamic therapy, and ongoing trials may help elucidate the clinical feasibility of glioma treatment with optimized sonically activated treatments.",0
"Computational modeling enables researchers to study and understand various complex biological phenomena in anticancer drug delivery systems (DDSs), especially nano-sized DDSs (NSDDSs). The combination of NSDDSs and therapeutic ultrasound (TUS), that is, focused ultrasound and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound, has made significant progress in recent years, opening many opportunities for cancer treatment. Multiple parameters require tuning and optimization to develop effective DDSs, such as NSDDSs, in which mathematical modeling can prove advantageous. In silico computational modeling of ultrasound-responsive DDS typically involves a complex framework of acoustic interactions, heat transfer, drug release from nanoparticles, fluid flow, mass transport, and pharmacodynamic governing equations. Owing to the rapid development of computational tools, modeling the different phenomena in multi-scale complex problems involved in drug delivery to tumors has become possible. In the present study, we present an in-depth review of recent advances in the mathematical modeling of TUS-mediated DDSs for cancer treatment. A detailed discussion is also provided on applying these computational models to improve the clinical translation for applications in cancer treatment. This article is categorized under: Nanotechnology Approaches to Biology > Nanoscale Systems in Biology Therapeutic Approaches and Drug Discovery > Nanomedicine for Oncologic Disease.",0
"Harmonic motion imaging (HMI) is an ultrasound-based elasticity imaging technique that utilizes oscillatory acoustic radiation force to estimate the mechanical properties of tissues, as well as monitor high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment. Conventionally, in HMI, a focused ultrasound (FUS) transducer generates oscillatory tissue displacements, and an imaging transducer acquires channel data for displacement estimation, with each transducer being driven with a separate system. The fixed position of the FUS focal spot requires mechanical translation of the transducers, which can be a time-consuming and challenging procedure. In this study, we developed and characterized a new HMI system with a multi-element FUS transducer with the capability of electronic focal steering of ±5 mm and ±2 mm from the geometric focus in the axial and lateral directions, respectively. A pulse sequence was developed to drive both the FUS and imaging transducers using a single ultrasound data acquisition (DAQ) system. The setup was validated on a tissue-mimicking phantom with embedded inclusions. Integrating beam steering with the mechanical translation of the transducers resulted in a consistent high contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the inclusions with Young's moduli of 22 and 44 kPa within a 5-kPa background while the data acquisition speed is increased by 4.5-5.2-fold compared to the case when only mechanical movements were applied. The feasibility of simultaneous generation of multiple foci and tracking the induced displacements is demonstrated in phantoms for applications where imaging or treatment of a larger region is needed. Moreover, preliminary feasibility is shown in a human subject with a breast tumor, where the mean HMI displacement within the tumor was about 4 times lower than that within perilesional tissues. The proposed HMI system facilitates data acquisition in terms of flexibility and speed and can be potentially used in the clinic for breast cancer imaging and treatment.",0
"Cancer is one of the diseases with high mortality worldwide. Various methods for cancer treatment are being developed, and among them, magnetically driven microrobots capable of minimally invasive surgery and accurate targeting are in the spotlight. However, existing medical magnetically manipulated microrobots contain magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which can cause toxicity to normal cells after the delivery of therapeutic drugs. In addition, there is a limitation in that cancer cells become resistant to the drug by mainly delivering only one drug, thereby reducing the treatment efficiency. In this paper, to overcome these limitations, we propose a microrobot that can separate/retrieve MNPs after precise targeting of the microrobot and can sequentially deliver dual drugs (gemcitabine (GEM) and doxorubicin (DOX)). First, after the proposed microrobot targeting, MNPs attached to the microrobot surface can be separated from the microrobot using focused ultrasound (FUS) and retrieved through an external magnetic field. Second, the active release of the first conjugated drug GEM to the surface of the microrobot is possible using near-infrared (NIR), and as the microrobot slowly decomposes over time, the release of the second encapsulated DOX is possible. Therefore, it is possible to increase the cancer cell treatment efficiency with sequential dual drugs in the microrobot. We performed basic experiments on the targeting of the proposed magnetically manipulated microrobot, separation/retrieval of MNPs, and the sequential dual-drug release and validated the performances of the microrobot through in vitro experiments using the EMA/FUS/NIR integrated system. As a result, the proposed microrobot is expected to be used as one of the methods to improve cancer cell treatment efficiency by improving the limitations of existing microrobots in cancer cell treatment.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Port wine birthmark, also known as port wine stain (PWS) is a skin discoloration characterized by red/purple patches caused by vascular malformation. PWS is typically treated by using lasers to destroy abnormal blood vessels. The laser heating facilitates selective photothermolysis of the vessels and attenuates quickly in the tissue due to high optical scattering. Therefore, residual abnormal capillaries deep in the tissue survive and often lead to the resurgence of PWS. Ultrasound (US) has also been proposed to treat PWS, however, it is nonselective with respect to the vasculature but penetrates deeper into the tissue. We aim to study the feasibility of a hybrid PWS treatment modality combining the advantages of both modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this manuscript, we propose a photoacoustic (PA) guided US focusing methodology for PWS treatment which combines the optical contrast-based selectivity with US penetration to focus the US energy onto the vasculature. The PA signals collected by the transducers, when time-reversed, amplified, and transmitted, converge onto the PWS, thus minimally affecting the neighboring tissue. We performed two- and three-dimensional simulations that mimic realistic transducers and medium properties in this proof of concept study. RESULTS: The time-reversed PA signals when transmitted from the transducers converged onto the vasculature, as expected, thus reducing the heating of the neighboring tissue. We observed that while the US focus is indeed affected due to experimental factors such as limited-view, large detector separation and finite detection bandwidth, and so forth, the US did focus completely or partially onto the vasculature demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed methodology. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology for PWS treatment. This treatment method can destroy the deeper capillaries while minimally heating the neighboring tissue, thus reducing the chances of the resurgence of PWS and as well as cosmetic scarring.",0
"Focused ultrasound stimulation (FUS) activates mechanosensitive ion channels and is emerging as a method of noninvasive neuromodulation. In preclinical studies, FUS of the spleen (sFUS) activates an anti-inflammatory neural pathway which suppresses acute and chronic inflammation. However, the relevance of sFUS for regulating inflammatory responses in humans is unknown. Here, we used a modified diagnostic ultrasound imaging system to target the spleen of healthy human subjects with 3 min of continuously swept or stationary focused pulsed ultrasound, delivered at three different energy levels within allowable safety exposure limits. Potential anti-inflammatory effects of sFUS were assessed by measuring sFUS-elicited changes in endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in whole blood samples from insonified subjects. We found that stimulation with either continuously swept or focused pulsed ultrasound has an anti-inflammatory effect: sFUS lowers TNF production for >2 h, with TNF returning to baseline by 24 h following sFUS. This response is independent of anatomical target (i.e., spleen hilum or parenchyma) or ultrasound energy level. No clinical, biochemical, or hematological parameters are adversely impacted. This is the first demonstration that sFUS suppresses the normal inflammatory response in humans, with potential implications for noninvasive bioelectronic therapy of inflammatory disorders.",0
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer acoustic output can vary over time as a result of an inconsistent power supply, damage to the transducer or deterioration over time. Therefore, easy implementation of a daily quality assurance (DQA) method is of great importance for pre-clinical research and clinical applications. We present here a thermochromic material-based phantom validated by thermal simulations and found to provide repeatable visual power output assessments in fewer than 15 s that are accurate to within 10%. Whereas current available methods such as radiation force balance measurements provide an estimate of the total acoustic power, we explain here that the thermochromic phantom is sensitive to the shape of the acoustic field at focus by changing the aperture of a multi-element transducer with a fixed acoustic power. The proposed phantom allows the end user to visually assess the transducer's functionality without resorting to expensive, time-consuming hydrophone measurements or image analysis.",0
"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising non-invasive technique for treating solid tumors using thermal and histotripsy-based mechanical ablation. However, its clinical significance in different tumor types is not fully understood. To assess its therapeutic efficacy and immunomodulatory properties, we compared HIFU thermal ablation and histotripsy ablation in dogs with spontaneous tumors. We also evaluated the ability of non-ablative HIFU-based mild hyperthermia (40-45 ºC) to improve Doxorubicin delivery and immunomodulation. Our results showed that HIFU thermal ablation induced tumor remission in the majority of treated patients over 60 days, while histotripsy achieved partial response to stable disease persistence. The adverse effects of thermal ablation were minor to moderate, while histotripsy exposures were relatively well-tolerated. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between HIFU-therapeutic response and serum anti-tumor cytokine profiles and the presence of functionally active cytotoxic immune cells in patients. Similarly, Doxorubicin-treated patients showed improved drug delivery, efficacy, and anti-tumor immune responses with HIFU hyperthermia. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that depending on the tumor type and treatment parameters, HIFU treatments can enable tumor growth control, immune activation, and chemotherapy in veterinary patient. These findings have significant clinical implications and highlight the potential of HIFU as a promising cancer treatment approach.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI allows to investigte neural activities and connectivity. While the non-human primate plays an essential role in neuroscience research, multimodal methods combining functional MRI with other neuroimaging and neuromodulation enable us to understand the brain network at multiple scales. APPROACH: In this study, a tight-fitting helmet-shape receive array with a single transmit loop for anesthetized macaque brain MRI at 7T was fabricated with four openings constructed in the coil housing to accommodate multimodal devices, and the coil performance was quantitatively evaluated and compared to a commercial knee coil. In addition, experiments over three macaques with infrared neural stimulation (INS), focused ultrasound stimulation (FUS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) were conducted. MAIN RESULTS: The RF coil showed higher transmit efficiency, comparable homogeneity, improved SNR and enlarged signal coverage over the macaque brain. Infrared neural stimulation was applied to the amygdala in deep brain region, and activations in stimulation sites and connected sites were detected, with the connectivity consistent with anatomical information. Focused ultrasound stimulation was applied to the left visual cortex, and activations were acquired along the ultrasound traveling path, with all time course curves consistent with pre-designed paradigms. The existence of transcranial direct current stimulation electrodes brought no interference to the RF system, as evidenced through high-resolution MPRAGE structure images. SIGNIFICANCE: This pilot study reveals the feasibility for brain investigation at multiple spatiotemporal scales, which may advance our understanding in dynamic brain networks.",0
"We investigated the effect of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) on gene expression related to alcohol dependence and histological effects on brain tissue. We also aimed at determining the miRNA-mRNA relationship and their pathways in alcohol dependence-induced expression changes after focused ultrasound therapy. We designed a case-control study for 100 days of observation to investigate differences in gene expression in the short-term stimulation group (STS) and long-term stimulation group (LTS) compared with the control sham group (SG). The study was performed in our Experimental Research Laboratory. 24 male high alcohol-preferring rats 63 to 79 days old, weighing 270 to 300 g, were included in the experiment. LTS received 50-day LIFU and STS received 10-day LIFU and 40-day sham stimulation, while the SG received 50-day sham stimulation. In miRNA expression analysis, it was found that LIFU caused gene expression differences in NAc. Significant differences were found between the groups for gene expression. Compared to the SG, the expression of 454 genes in the NAc region was changed in the STS while the expression of 382 genes was changed in the LTS. In the LTS, the expression of 32 genes was changed in total compared to STS. Our data suggest that LIFU targeted on NAc may assist in the treatment of alcohol dependence, especially in the long term possibly through altering gene expression. Our immunohistochemical studies verified that LIFU does not cause any tissue damage. These findings may lead to new studies in investigating the efficacy of LIFU for the treatment of alcohol dependence and also for other psychiatric disorders.",1
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain but is also an important obstacle for the effective delivery of therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been shown to reversibly disrupt the BBB. However, treatment of diffuse regions across the brain along with the effect on Alzheimer's disease relevant pathology need to be better characterized. This study is an open-labelled single-arm trial (NCT04118764) to investigate the feasibility of modulating BBB permeability in the default mode network and the impact on cognition, amyloid and tau pathology as well as BBB integrity. Nine participants [mean age 70.2 ± 7.2 years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 21.9] underwent three biweekly procedures with follow-up visits up to 6 months. The BBB permeability of the bilateral hippocampi, anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus was transiently increased without grade 3 or higher adverse events. Participants did not experience worsening trajectory of cognitive decline (ADAS-cog11, MMSE). Whole brain vertex-based analysis of the 18F-florbetaben PET imaging demonstrated clusters of modest SUVR reduction in the right parahippocampal and inferior temporal lobe. However, CSF and blood biomarkers did not demonstrate any amelioration of Alzheimer's disease pathology (P-tau181, amyloid-β42/40 ratio), nor did it show persistent BBB dysfunction (plasma PDGFRbeta and CSF-to-plasma albumin ratio). This study provides neuroimaging and fluid biomarker data to characterize the safety profile of MRgFUS BBB modulation in neurodegeneration as a potential strategy for enhanced therapeutic delivery.",1
"OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, including agitation and aggressive behavior. These symptoms increase with disease severity, ranging from 10% in mild cognitive impairment to 50% in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, pose a great risk for self-injury and injury to caregivers, result in high rates of institutionalization and great suffering for patients and families. Current pharmacological therapies have limited efficacy and a high potential for severe side effects. Thus, there is a growing need to develop novel therapeutics tailored to safely and effectively reduce agitation and aggressive behavior in AD. Here, we investigate for the first time the use of focused ultrasound combined with anesthetic-loaded nanodroplets (nanoFUS) targeting the amygdala (key structure in the neurocircuitry of agitation) as a novel minimally invasive tool to modulate local neural activity and reduce agitation and aggressive behavior in the TgCRND8 AD transgenic mice. METHODS: Male and female animals were tested in the resident-intruder (i.e., aggressive behavior) and open-field tests (i.e., motor agitation) for baseline measures, followed by treatment with active- or sham-nanoFUS. Behavioral testing was then repeated after treatment. RESULTS: Active-nanoFUS neuromodulation reduced aggressive behavior and agitation in male mice, as compared to sham-treated controls. Treatment with active-nanoFUS increased the time male mice spent in social-non-aggressive behaviors. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that neuromodulation with active-nanoFUS may be a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms, with special focus on agitation and aggressive behaviors. Further studies are necessary to establish cellular, molecular and long-term behavioral changes following treatment with nanoFUS.",1
"Background Neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer disease) characterized by the deposition of various pathogenic forms of tau protein in the brain are collectively referred to as tauopathies. Identification of the molecular drivers and pathways of neurodegeneration is critical to individualized targeted treatment of these disorders. However, despite important advances in fluid biomarker detection, characterization of these molecular subtypes is limited by the blood-brain barrier. Purpose To evaluate the feasibility and safety of focused ultrasound-mediated liquid biopsy (sonobiopsy) in the detection of brain-derived protein biomarkers in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy (PS19 mice). Materials and Methods Sonobiopsy was performed by sonicating the cerebral hemisphere in 2-month-old PS19 and wild-type mice, followed by measurement of plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species (30 minutes after sonication in the sonobiopsy group). Next, spatially targeted sonobiopsy was performed by sonicating either the cerebral cortex or the hippocampus in 6-month-old PS19 mice. To detect changes in plasma neurofilament light chain (a biomarker of neurodegeneration) levels, blood samples were collected before and after sonication (15 and 45-60 minutes after sonication). Histologic staining was performed to evaluate tissue damage after sonobiopsy. The Shapiro-Wilk test, unpaired and paired t tests, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used. Results In the 2-month-old mice, sonobiopsy significantly increased the normalized levels of plasma p-tau species compared with the conventional blood-based liquid biopsy (p-tau-181-to-mouse tau [m-tau] ratio: 1.7-fold increase, P = .006; p-tau-231-to-m-tau ratio: 1.4-fold increase, P = .048). In the 6-month-old PS19 mice, spatially targeted sonobiopsy resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in plasma neurofilament light chain after sonication of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (P < .001). After optimization of the sonobiopsy parameters, no excess microhemorrhage was observed in the treated cerebral hemisphere compared with the contralateral side. Conclusion This study showed the feasibility of sonobiopsy to release phosphorylated tau species and neurofilament light chain to the blood circulation, potentially facilitating diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

"BACKGROUND: Coronary microthromboembolism after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) requires urgent and effective treatment. Early and effective recovery of coronary microcirculation perfusion for the management of AMI would be crucial for better prognosis. Ultrasound assisted thrombolysis in the in-vitro experiments have great potential for the elimination of acute coronary microthromboembolism, especially with stable cavitation using low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) and dodecafluoropentane-loaded acoustic phase-change nanoparticles (DDFP@NPs). Therefore, our study sought to perform animal experiments using this novel treatment method in a porcine model with acute coronary microthromboembolism for further investigation of potential therapeutic values. METHODS: Porcine model with acute coronary thromboembolism was established using percutaneous coronary intervention and autologous thrombus injection. For ultrasound assisted thrombolysis, DDFP@NPs were prepared by rotary evaporation and sonication process, and LIFU was optimized. Echocardiography and TTC staining were performed for the evaluation of porcine model establishment and treatment effect. RESULTS: The treatment using LIFU guided DDFP@NPs had almost completely recanalized culprit coronary branch after treatment procedure, and smaller infarcted size (5.4 ± 1.0%), better LVEF (52.5 ± 1.8%) and better coronary microcirculation after 28 days of treatment, which outperformed treatments using LIFU+SonoVue microbubbles (infarcted size: 26.4 ± 3.5% and LVEF: 37.2 ± 3.1%) and LIFU only (infarcted size: 32.2 ± 3.1% and LVEF: 32.2 ± 0.4%) (all P < 0.05), while the treatment effect were similar to treatment using intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator (infarcted size: 4.9 ± 0.9% and LVEF: 53.1 ± 1.1%) (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study has innovatively established a treatment method using DDFP@NPs combined with LIFU irradiation for coronary thrombolysis and verified its treatment effect with high-efficient thrombolysis in the in-vivo experiments, which can be considered as powerful experimental evident of the novel method for potential clinical use of acute coronary thrombolysis. Multidimensional experimental investigations and cautious verification may need before the method could be used as treatment before preliminary clinical trials.",1
"OBJECTIVES: MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) is an emerging non-invasive treatment. It is helpful in investigating the mid-term grading efficacy and safety of MRgFUS, and possible risk factors in participants with painful bone metastases. METHODS: This four-center prospective study enrolled 96 participants between June 2016 and May 2019 with painful bone metastases. The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Brief Pain Inventory-Quality of Life (BPI-QoL) score, morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD), and the adverse events (AEs) were recorded before and at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after MRgFUS. The repeated ANOVA tests were used to analyze the change in NRS and BPI-QoL, and logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the possible risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 82 participants completed the 3-month follow-up period. And 16 (19.5%) participants were complete responders (CR), 46 (56.1%) participants were effective responders (ER), and the other 20 (24.4%) participants were non-responders (NR). The NRS (2.67 ± 2.47 at 3 months compared to 6.38 ± 1.70 before treatment) and BPI-QoL score (3.11 ± 2.51 at 3 months compared to 5.40 ± 1.85 before treatment) significantly decreased after the treatment at all time points (p < 0.001). Eleven adverse events were recorded and they were all cured within 1 to 52 days after treatment. The non-perfused volume (NPV) ratio (p = 0.001) and the bone metastases lesion type (p = 0.025) were the key risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: MRgFUS can be used as a non-invasive, effective, and safe modality to treat painful bone metastases. NPV ratio and the lesion type may be used as affecting factors to predict the mid-term efficacy of MRgFUS. KEY POINTS: • MRgFUS can be considered a non-invasive, effective, and safe modality to treat painful bone metastases. • The NRS and BPI-QoL score at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months all decreased significantly (p < 0.001) after receiving MRgFUS. Among 82 participants, 16 (19.5%) were complete responders, 46 (56.1%) were effective responders, and the other 20 (24.4%) were non-responders. • According to logistic regression analysis, non-perfused volume ratio and the bone metastases lesion type were the affecting factors to predict the mid-term efficacy of MRgFUS. The adjusted OR of non-perfused volume ratio was 0.86 (p = 0.001), and osteoblastic lesion type was 0.06 (p = 0.025).",1
"Background Recent consensus statements and clinical trials have assessed the value of MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery for pain palliation of bone metastases; however, a comparison with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has not been performed. Purpose To compare safety and effectiveness data of MRI-guided focused ultrasound and EBRT in the treatment of bone metastases. Materials and Methods Participants with painful bone metastases, excluding skull and vertebral bodies, were enrolled in a prospective open-label nonrandomized phase II study between January 2017 and May 2019 and underwent either MRI-guided focused ultrasound or EBRT. The primary end point was the overall response rate at 1-month following treatment, assessed via the numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain (0-10 scale, with zero meaning ""no pain"" and 10 meaning ""the worst pain imaginable""). Secondary end points were improvements at 12-month follow-up in NRS and quality of life (QoL) measures, including the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), QoL-Questionnaire Cancer-15 Palliative Care (QLQ-C15-PAL), and QoL-Questionnaire Bone Metastases-22 (QLQ-BM22) and analysis of adverse events. Statistical analyses, including linear regression, χ2 test, and Student t test followed the per-protocol principle. Results Among 198 participants, 100 underwent MRI-guided focused ultrasound (mean age, 63 years ± 13 [SD]; 51 women), and 98 underwent EBRT (mean age, 65 years ± 14; 52 women). The overall response rates at 1-month follow-up were 91% (91 of 100) and 67% (66 of 98), respectively, in the focused ultrasound and EBRT arms (P < .001), and complete response rates were 43% (43 of 100) and 16% (16 of 98) (P < .001). The mean baseline NRS score was 7.0 ± 2.1 for focused ultrasound and 6.6 ± 2.4 for EBRT (P = .16); at 1-month follow-up, they were reduced to 3.2 ± 0.3 and 5.1 ± 0.3 (P < .001), respectively. QLQ-C15-PAL for physical function (P = .002), appetite (P < .001), nausea and vomiting (P < .001), dyspnea (P < .001), and QoL (P < .001) scores were lower in the focused ultrasound group. The overall adverse event rates were 15% (15 of 100) after focused ultrasound and 24% (24 of 98) after EBRT. Conclusion MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery and external beam radiation therapy showed similar improvements in pain palliation and quality of life, with low adverse event rates. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

"Magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is an innovative treatment for patients with painful bone metastases. The adoption of MR-HIFU will be influenced by several factors beyond its effectiveness. To identify contextual factors affecting the adoption of MR-HIFU, we conducted a group concept mapping (GCM) study in four European countries. The GCM was conducted in two phases. First, the participants brainstormed statements guided by the focus prompt ""One factor that may influence the uptake of MR-HIFU in clinical practice is..."". Second, the participants sorted statements into categories and rated the statements according to their importance and changeability. To generate a concept map, multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were conducted, and average ratings for each (cluster of) factors were calculated. Forty-five participants contributed to phase I and/or II (56% overall participation rate). The resulting concept map comprises 49 factors, organized in 12 clusters: ""competitive treatments"", ""physicians' attitudes"", ""alignment of resources"", ""logistics and workflow"", ""technical disadvantages"", ""radiotherapy as first-line therapy"", ""aggregating knowledge and improving awareness"", ""clinical effectiveness"", ""patients' preferences"", ""reimbursement"", ""cost-effectiveness"" and ""hospital costs"". The factors identified echo those from the literature, but their relevance and interrelationship are case-specific. Besides evidence on clinical effectiveness, contextual factors from 10 other clusters should be addressed to support adoption of MR-HIFU.",1
"The aim of this study was to ascertain the safety of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 (CIN 2/3) in patients with fertility requirements. This was a prospective one-arm study. Consecutive CIN 2/3 patients diagnosed with histopathology were screened, enrolled and treated from September 2019 to September 2020 in the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College. All patients were treated with a combination of HIFU and antiviral treatment with REBACIN. The scheduled follow-up visits were 1 week, 1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo and 12 mo after surgery. The primary outcomes included cure and human papillomavirus clearance rates. We screened 287 consecutive CIN 2/3 patients in our hospital, 29 of whom were enrolled and treated in this study. The cure rate reached 82.8% at 7 mo after treatment and 96.6% within 1 y. The HPV-negative rate reached 72.4% (21/29) around 6 mo after treatment, with mild side effects during and after the procedure. Our study suggests that in CIN 2/3 study participants with fertility requirements, HIFU + REBACIN therapy is a safe and effective therapeutic option with a high cure rate, HPV clearance and few side effects.",1
"BACKGROUND: In this study, the changes of vaginal microbiome after focused ultrasound (FU) treatment were evaluated to explore the possible mechanism of FU in the treatment of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. METHODS: This study was nested in the FU arm of a prospective cohort study. A total of 37 patients diagnosed with HR-HPV infection-related cervical low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study from October 2020 to November 2021, and these patients were treated with FU. We used 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing to profile the vaginal microbiota composition of patients before and 3 months after FU treatment. RESULTS: After FU treatment, HR-HPV was cleared in 24 patients, with a clearance rate of 75.0% (24/32). Lactobacillus iners was the predominant species among all samples. No significant difference was found in alpha-diversity index before and 3 months after FU treatment (P > 0.05), but the rarefaction curves showed that the vaginal microbial diversity before FU treatment was higher than that after FU treatment. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) showed that Bifidobacterium contributed the most to the difference between the two groups at the genus level, and the abundance after FU treatment was significantly higher than that before treatment (P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease of vaginal microbial diversity may be related to the clearance of HR-HPV infection, and FU treatment contributed to the decrease of vaginal microbial diversity. Increased Bifidobacterium abundance in the vaginal microbiome may be associated with clearance of HR-HPV infection, and FU treatment may contribute to the increase in Bifidobacterium abundance. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:  This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on 23/11/2020 (ChiCTR2000040162).",1
"Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) are high grade glioma (HGG) that occur primarily in children, and represent a leading cause of death in pediatric patients with brain tumors with a median overall survival of only 8-11 months. While these lesions were previously thought to behave similarly to adult HGG, emerging data have demonstrated that DIPG are a biologically distinct entity from adult HGG frequently driven by mutations in the histone genes H3.3 and H3.1 not found in adult glioma. While biopsy of DIPG was historically felt to confer unacceptable risk of morbidity and mortality, multiple studies have demonstrated that stereotactic biopsy of DIPG is safe, allowing not only for improved understanding of DIPG but also forming the basis for protocols for personalized medicine in DIPG. However, current options for personalized medicine in DIPG are limited by the lack of efficacious targeted therapies for the mutations commonly found in DIPG. Multiple treatment modalities including targeted therapies, immunotherapy, convection enhanced delivery (CED), and focused ultrasound, are in various stages of investigation.",1
"Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), now known as Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) is a devastating pediatric brain tumor with limited treatment options and a very poor prognosis. Despite more than 250 clinical trials aimed to treat children diagnosed with DMG, no curative therapies currently exist for this patient population. A major obstacle has been the intact blood brain barrier (BBB) which prevents most therapeutics from crossing into the tumor bed. Focused Ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging, noninvasive medical technology which has been shown in both preclinical and clinical research to disrupt the blood brain barrier safely and temporarily. FUS blood brain barrier opening has been studied in combination with chemotherapies in preclinical DMG models, and this technology is now being investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors. Focused ultrasound has additional mechanisms of action, including sonodynamic therapy and radiation sensitization, that hold promise as future DMG therapies as well. This paper, largely based off the proceedings from a workshop held by the Focused Ultrasound Foundation in October of 2021, summarizes the current state of the field of focused ultrasound for DIPG/DMG, including preclinical, technical, and clinical summaries in addition to recommended next steps for continued advancement of the game changing technology of Focused Ultrasound.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most prevalent movement disorders in adults and may be highly disabling for some. Magnetic resonance image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS) has been shown to control tremor efficaciously and with acceptable risk. To date, paresthesia and ataxia are the most common adverse effects (AE). Nevertheless, the impact of MRIgFUS thalamotomy on balance is not well established. METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent MRIgFUS for ET and completed 6 months of follow-up. Tremor severity and functional disability were assessed using the Essential Tremor Rating Scale and the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was applied to objectively measure balance status. RESULTS: All treatments were successful. The sonication target was 1-2 mm above the depth of the intercommissural line. Procedures lasted less the 2 h, with an average of 8 sonications per patient. Twenty-four patients were included in the tremor analysis. The hand tremor score was improved by 76% after 6 months of follow-up and 87% of patients self-reported marked improvement (≥75%). Disability scores showed marked improvement (78%), leading to a significant improvement in quality of life. At the final follow-up, 48% of the patients reported no side effects. When present, AE were generally transient and were considered mild in 96% of affected patients. Paresthesia and subjective feeling of unsteadiness were the most common persistent complaints (23% and 20%, respectively). Regarding objective ataxia, BBS scores remained stable throughout follow-up for most patients. Only 2 patients suffered a mild worsening of balance although no patients experienced moderate or severe ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective feeling of unsteadiness is one of the most frequent AE after MRIgFUS, although objective ataxia is infrequent and mild. Selecting the most appropriate lesion location and procedural parameters should increase treatment benefits while reducing side effects.",1
"OBJECTIVE: One of the key metrics that is used to predict the likelihood of success of MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy is the overall calvarial skull density ratio (SDR). However, this measure does not fully predict the sonication parameters that would be required or the technical success rates. The authors aimed to assess other skull characteristics that may also contribute to technical success. METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied consecutive patients with essential tremor who were treated by MRgFUS at their center between 2017 and 2021. They evaluated the correlation between the different treatment parameters, particularly maximum power and energy delivered, with a range of patients' skull metrics and demographics. Machine learning algorithms were applied to investigate whether sonication parameters could be predicted from skull density metrics alone and whether including combined local transducer SDRs with overall calvarial SDR would increase model accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 77.1 (SD 9.2) years, and 78% of treatments (49/63) were performed in males. The mean SDR was 0.51 (SD 0.10). Among the evaluated metrics, SDR had the highest correlation with the maximum power used in treatment (ρ = -0.626, p < 0.001; proportion of local SDR values ≤ 0.8 group also had ρ = +0.626, p < 0.001) and maximum energy delivered (ρ = -0.680, p < 0.001). Machine learning algorithms achieved a moderate ability to predict maximum power and energy required from the local and overall SDRs (accuracy of approximately 80% for maximum power and approximately 55% for maximum energy), and high ability to predict average maximum temperature reached from the local and overall SDRs (approximately 95% accuracy). CONCLUSIONS: The authors compared a number of skull metrics against SDR and showed that SDR was one of the best indicators of treatment parameters when used alone. In addition, a number of other machine learning algorithms are proposed that may be explored to improve its accuracy when additional data are obtained. Additional metrics related to eventual sonication parameters should also be identified and explored.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy is an innovative method for the unilateral treatment of essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) related tremor. Our aim was to assess cognitive changes following MRgFUS thalamotomy to better investigate its safety profile. METHODS: We prospectively investigated the cognitive and neurobehavioral profile of patients consecutively undergoing MRgFUS within a 2-year period. Patients had a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment before and six months after MRgFUS thalamotomy. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 40 patients (males 38; mean age±SD 67.7 ± 10.7; mean disease duration±SD 9.3 ± 5.6; ET 22, PD 18 patients). For the whole sample, improvements were detected in tremor (Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Rating Scale for tremor 35.79 ± 14.39 vs 23.03 ± 10.95; p < 0.001), anxiety feelings (Hamilton Anxiety rating scale 5.36 ± 3.80 vs 2.54 ± 3.28, p < 0.001), in the overall cognitive status (MMSE 25.93 ± 3.76 vs 27.54 ± 2.46, p 0.003; MOCA 22.80 ± 4.08 vs 24.48 ± 3.13, p < 0.001), and in quality of life (Quality of life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire 36.14 ± 12.91 vs 5.14 ± 6.90, p < 0.001 and PD Questionnaire-8 5.61 ± 4.65 vs 1.39 ± 2.33, p 0.001). No changes were detected in frontal and executive functions, verbal fluency and memory, abstract reasoning and problem-solving abilities. CONCLUSION: Our study moves a step forward in establishing the cognitive sequelae of MRgFUS thalamotomy and in endorsing effectiveness and safety.",1
"An orthotopically allografted mouse GL26 glioma model (Ccr2RFP/wt-Cx3cr1GFP/wt) was used to evaluate the effect of transient, focal opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) on the composition of tumor-associated macrophages and microglia (TAMs). BBB opening was induced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) combined with microbubbles. CX3CR1-GFP cells and CCR2-RFP cells in brain tumors were quantified in microscopic images. Tumors in animals treated with a single session of MRgFUS did not exhibit significant changes in cell numbers when compared with tumors in animals not receiving FUS. However, tumors that received two or three sessions of MRgFUS had significantly increased amounts of both CX3CR1-GFP and CCR2-RFP cells. The effect of MRgFUS on immune cell composition was also characterized and quantified using flow cytometry. Glioma implantation resulted in increased amounts of lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils in the brain parenchyma. Tumors administered MRgFUS exhibited increased numbers of monocytes and monocyte-derived TAMs. In addition, MRgFUS-treated tumors exhibited more CD80+ cells in monocytes and microglia. In summary, transient, focal opening of the BBB using MRgFUS combined with microbubbles can activate the homing and differentiation of monocytes and induce a shift toward a more pro-inflammatory status of the immune environment in glioblastoma.",1
"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine the effect of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) in ischemic heart failure (IHF) and explore the potential neuroimmune mechanism. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to ultrasound (US) with specific parameters, and electrocardiograms were recorded to analyze the effect of LIFU and/or vagal denervation on heart rate. Thereafter, myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by left anterior artery ligation, and LIFU was performed three times a day for 25 days after MI. Echocardiography, Masson staining, and ELISA were used to evaluate the effect of LIFU on the structure and function of the heart. Finally, ELISA, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis were performed to determine the effect of LIFU on the inflammation and the expression of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP)-related mediators. RESULTS: LIFU reduced heart rate in rats (control vs LIFU, P < .01), and vagotomy (VT) eliminated this effect of LIFU on heart rate (VT vs LIFU + VT, P > .01). LIFU-ameliorated IHF in terms of cardiac structure and function (MI vs MI + LIFU, P < .01), but VT abrogated the beneficial effect of LIFU (MI + VT vs MI + LIFU + VT, P > .01). After the treatment of LIFU, decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines, increased proportion of anti-inflammatory macrophages, and increased expression of CAP-related mediators (MI vs MI + LIFU, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: LIFU ameliorates IHF whereas the CAP plays a promising role. LIFU has the potential to be a novel nonpharmacological and noninvasive therapy for the treatment of coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular diseases.",1
"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of focused ultrasound (FU) at different focal depths in treating vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 84 patients with VLS. Among them, 43 cases were treated with FU at a focal depth of 2.5 mm and 41 cases at a focal depth of 4.0 mm. Therapeutic time, treatment energy, postoperative efficacy, complications and recurrence rates were compared. RESULTS: No statistically substantially differences in age, disease course, history of immune system diseases, lesion size and severity of symptoms were found between the two groups. All patients successfully received FU therapy. No significant difference in curative rate was observed between the two groups at 3, 6 and 12 months after FU therapy. At 12 months after FU therapy, the recurrence rate of the experimental group (FU treatment at 2.5 mm focal depth) was lower than the control group (FU treatment at 4.0 mm focal depth) (7.0% vs 24.4%, p = 0.027). The experimental group was treated for a shorter period of time [22.69 ± 0.64 (min) vs 24.93 ± 0.72(min), p = 0.022] and at a lower dose[5,026.05 ± 148.00(J) vs 5,484.26 ± 160.60(J) p = 0.039]. CONCLUSION: Compared with that at the routine focal depth (4.0 mm), FU therapy at a low treatment depth (2.5 mm) can achieve a similar therapeutic effect but lower recurrence rate, therapeutic time and treatment energy. This work provides insight into the optimization of clinical protocols.",1
"OBJECTIVE: To compare the acute and chronic safety and treatment effects of non-invasive hepatic histotripsy vs. percutaneous microwave (MW) ablation in a healthy porcine model. METHODS: This was a dual-arm study in which each animal (n = 14) received either a single hepatic microwave (n = 6) or histotripsy (n = 6 single treatment; n = 2 double treatment) under ultrasound guidance. The goal was to create 2.5-3.0 cm short-axis treatments in similar locations across modalities. Animals were survived for 1 month with contrast-enhanced CT imaging on days 0, 2, 7, 14, and 28. On day 28, necropsy and histopathology were performed. RESULTS: All procedures were well-tolerated. MW ablation zones were longer and more oblong, but equivalent in the short axes to histotripsy zones on immediate post-procedure CT (p < 0.001 and p = 0.45, respectively). Overall, MW volumes were larger (21.4 cm3 vs. 13.4 cm3; p = 0.001) and histotripsy treatment zones were more spherical (p = 0.007). Histotripsy zones were close to the prescribed size (p < 0.001). Over the study period, histotripsy treatment zones decreased in volume while microwave ablation zones slightly increased (-83% vs. +17%, p = 0.001). There were several imaging-only findings: Branch portal vein thrombus with both histotripsy (7/8) and MW (6/6), hematoma in 2/6 MW only, and a gallbladder injury in 1/6 MW animals. The ablation zones demonstrated complete cellular destruction for both modalities. CONCLUSION: Histotripsy was associated with more spherical treatments, fewer biliary complications, and greater treatment zone involution. Hepatic MW and histotripsy treatment in a normal porcine model appear at least equally effective for creating treatment zones with a similar safety profile. KEY POINTS: • Microwave ablation and histotripsy for liver treatment in a healthy porcine model yield equivalent procedural tolerance and cellular destruction. • Histotripsy was associated with more spherical treatments, fewer biliary complications, and greater treatment zone involution over the 28-day follow-up period. • These findings confirm the safety and efficacy of hepatic histotripsy and support the pursuit of clinical trials to further evaluate the translatability of these results.",1
"A toroidal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer was used to non-invasively treat liver tissues in vivo in a pig model. The transducer was divided into 32 concentric rings with equal surface areas operating at 2.5 MHz. First, attenuation of skin, fat, muscle and liver tissues was measured in fresh animal samples to adjust the energy delivered to the focal zone. Then, 8 animals were included in the present protocol and placed in a dorsal decubitus proclive position at an angle of 15°. The device was held by hand, and sonications were performed during apnea. Two thermal HIFU lesions were created in 40 s in each animal. The average abdominal wall thickness was 14.8 ± 1.3 mm (12.5-17.6 mm). The longest and shortest axes of the HIFU ablations were 20.9 ± 6.3 mm (14.0-33.7 mm) and 14.2 ± 5.5 mm (7.0-22.0 mm), respectively. All HIFU lesions were visible on sonograms. The correlation between the dimensions of the HIFU lesions observed on sonograms and those obtained during gross examination was r = 0.84. Creating large and fast ablations with reliable ultrasound imaging guidance in the liver using this handheld device may represent a new therapeutic option for patients with liver tumors.",1
"PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of histotripsy subcutaneous (SQ) fat treatment in an in-vivo porcine model, and evaluate evolution of the treated volume on MRI and pathology. METHODS/MATERIALS: 10 histotripsy SQ fat treatments were completed in 5 swine, divided into four groups based on pre-determined survival: day 0 (n = 4), day 7 (n = 2), day 28 (n = 2), and day 56 (n = 2). A 4.0 × 4.0x2.0 cm ovoid treatment was created in the fat pad of the posterior thorax. MRI of survived animals were obtained on day 7 (n = 6), day 28 (n = 4), and day 56 (n = 2), and reviewed for size and imaging characteristics. Technical success was defined as the creation of a treatment zone in the targeted SQ fat. Skin firmness and indentation were qualitatively scored. RESULTS: Histotripsy had a 100% (10/10) technical success for creation of SQ fat treatments. Mean treatment time was 35.5 min (range 35-36.5). The volume of treated SQ fat demonstrated 92% volume reduction over the study. Day 0 gross pathology treatment had a mean volume of 12.6 cm3 (± 2.1) (prescribed volume of 16.7 cm3), which decreased to 8.3 cm3 (± 2.8) by day 7 (34% overall decrease), 3.0 cm3 (± 0.5) by day 28 (76% overall decrease), and 1.0 cm3 (± 1.2) by day 56 (92% overall decrease). Mean firmness and indentation scores showed no change from baseline at all time points, with no overlying skin injury. CONCLUSION: Histotripsy safely and effectively treated SQ fat of an in-vivo porcine model, with volume reduction over time.",1
"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the effect of fat-layer thickness and focal depth on the pressure and temperature distribution of tissue. METHODS: Computer simulations were performed for the skin-fat layer models during high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment. The acoustic pressure field was calculated using the nonlinear Westervelt equation and coupled with the Pennes bioheat transfer equation to obtain the temperature distribution. To investigate the effect of the thickness of the fat layer on pressure and thermal distributions, the thickness of the fat layer behind the focal point (z = 13.5 mm) changed from 8 to 24 mm by 2 mm step. The pressure and temperature distribution spectra were extracted. RESULTS: The simulated results were validated using the experimental results with a 98% correlation coefficient (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference between the pressure amplitude and temperature distribution for the 8-14 mm thickness of the fat layer (p < 0.05). By changing the focal point from 11.5 to 13.5 mm, the maximum acoustic pressure at the focal point increased 66%, and the maximum temperature was 56%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Considering the specific treatment plan for each patient, according to the skin and fat layer thicknesses, can help prevent side effects and optimize the treatment process of HIFU.",1
"Bilateral thermal capsulotomy with magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS-capsulotomy) is a promising treatment option for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Herein, we investigated the effects of bilateral thermal capsulotomy with MRgFUS on neural oscillations in treatment-refractory OCD patients. Eight patients underwent resting-state MEG with repeated recordings before and 1 and 6 months after MRgFUS-capsulotomy, and the oscillatory power and phase coherence over the entire cortical sensor area were measured. After MRgFUS-capsulotomy, the high beta band power in the fronto-central and temporal areas decreased at 1 month and remained stable for 6 months. Cortical connectivity of the high beta band gradually decreased over the entire cortical area during the following 6 months. At 1 month, improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms was significantly correlated with changes in high beta band power in both the frontotemporal and temporal areas. The treatment effect of MRgFUS-capsulotomy may be attributed to the cortical high beta band. Our results provide an advanced understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying MRgFUS-capsulotomy and other neuromodulatory interventions for treatment-refractory OCD.",1
"OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in combination with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in treating patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). METHODS: The data of unresectable LAPC patients who received chemotherapy with or without HIFU ablation were retrieved retrospectively. The overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), cancer antigen 19-9 response rate, and safety were compared between these two groups before and after propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS: Overall, 254 patients with LAPC were included, of whom 92 underwent HIFU ablation. After PSM to control for potential biases, HIFU was associated with improved OS (12.8 versus 12.2 months, log-rank P = .046), as compared to patients without HIFU ablation. Patients with numeric rating scale (NRS) less than 4, and receiving HIFU ablation were significantly associated with improved OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.365 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.148-0.655], P = .002; aHR = 0.490 [95% CI = 0.250-0.961], P = .038; respectively) by multivariate analyses with the adjustment of age, NRS, and tumor size. ORR was also observed to be higher in HIFU group of 30.0% than in the chemotherapy group of 13.3% (P = .039). No severe adverse events of special interest or HIFU-caused deaths were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with unresectable LAPC who received gemcitabine-based chemotherapy might benefit from additional HIFU ablation.",1
"Motor fluctuations (MF) are deemed by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) as the most troublesome disease feature resulting from the increasing impairment in responsiveness to dopaminergic drug treatments. MF are characterized by the loss of a stable response to levodopa over the nychthemeron with the reappearance of motor (and non-motor) parkinsonian clinical signs at various moments during the day and night. They normally appear after a few years of levodopa treatment and with a variable, though overall increasing severity, over the disease course. The armamentarium of first-line treatment options has widened in the last decade with new once-a-daily compounds, including a catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitor - Opicapone-, two MAO-B inhibitors plus channel blocker - Zonisamide and Safinamide and one amantadine extended-release formulation - ADS5012. In addition to apomorphine injection or oral levodopa dispersible tablets, which have been available for a long time, new on-demand therapies such as apomorphine sublingual or levodopa inhaled formulations have recently shown efficacy as rescue therapies for Off-time treatment. When the management of MF becomes difficult in spite of oral/on-demand options, more complex therapies should be considered, including surgical, i.e. deep brain stimulation, or device-aided therapies with pump systems delivering continuous subcutaneous or intestinal levodopa or subcutaneous apomorphine formulation. Older and less commonly used ablative techniques (radiofrequency pallidotomy) may also be effective while there is still scarce data regarding Off-time reduction using a new lesional approach, i.e. magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound. The choice between the different advanced therapies options is a shared decision that should consider physician opinion on contraindication/main target symptom, patients' preference, caregiver's availability together with public health systems and socio-economic environment. The choice of the right/first add-on treatment is still a matter of debate as well as the proper time for an advanced therapy to be considered. In this narrative review, we discuss all the above cited aspects of MF in patients with PD, including their phenomenology, management, by means of pharmacological and advanced therapies, on-going clinical trials and future research and treatment perspectives.",1
"Magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a rapidly developing technique used for tremor relief in tremor-predominant Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor that has demonstrated successful results. Here, we describe the neuropathological findings in a woman who died from a fall 10 days after successful MRgFUS for tremor-predominant PD. Histological analysis demonstrates the characteristic early postoperative MRI findings including 3 distinct zones on T2-weighted imaging: (1) a hypointense core, (2) a hyperintense region with hypointense rim, and (3) a slightly hyperintense, poorly marginated surrounding area. Histopathological analyses also demonstrate the suspected cellular processes composing each of these regions including central hemorrhagic necrosis with surrounding cytotoxic edema and a rim of mostly unaffected vasogenic edema with some reactive and reparative processes. Overall, this case demonstrates the correlation of postoperative imaging findings with the subacute neuropathological findings after MRgFUS for PD.",1
"Background: MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA) is under investigation for whole-gland ablation of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The ideal method for post-TULSA bladder drainage through postoperative suprapubic tube (SPT) vs indwelling urethral catheter (UC) has not been established. The objective of this study was to evaluate urinary outcomes after whole-gland TULSA, comparing postoperative SPT with UC. Materials and Methods: Two-institution retrospective analysis of whole-gland TULSA for men with grade group 1 and 2 prostate cancer. One institution placed SPT at the time of TULSA with clamp trials (day 10) and removal once voiding. The second placed UC until void trial (day 7). Outcomes included the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), urinary bother score, catheter reinsertion, stricture, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), and incontinence. Results: Forty-five patients (median age 67) were analyzed. The UC cohort (N = 26) was older (p = 0.007) than the SPT cohort (N = 19) but with similar baseline prostate volumes, IPSS, and urinary bother scores. Patients receiving UC had fewer days with catheter (p = 0.013). Although UC patients suffered more lower urinary tract symptoms at 1-month post-TULSA, there was no significant difference between IPSS scores at baseline and 6 months after surgery regardless of urinary management strategy, although the UC group noted significantly decreased urinary bother. Rates of infection were similar between groups. Six strictures were observed overall, with more in the SPT group, although the difference was not significant (4/19 [21.1%] SPT; 2/26 [7.7%] UC). At 6 months, incontinence rates were low and similar between groups (2/19 [10.5%] SPT; 4/26 [15.4%] UC) and only one patient (UC) required CIC. Conclusions: Our overall findings suggest that SPT and UC are both acceptable options for postoperative bladder drainage after whole-gland TULSA, with statistically similar rates of urinary complications but a slightly different side effect profile.",1
"Boiling histotripsy (BH) is a focused ultrasound technology that uses millisecond-long pulses with shock fronts to induce mechanical tissue ablation. The pulsing scheme and mechanisms of BH differ from those of cavitation cloud histotripsy, which was previously developed for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The goal of the work described here was to evaluate the feasibility of using BH to ablate fresh ex vivo human prostate tissue as a proof of principle for developing BH for prostate applications. Fresh human prostate samples (N = 24) were obtained via rapid autopsy (<24 h after death, institutional review board exempt). Samples were analyzed using shear wave elastography to ensure that mechanical properties of autopsy tissue were clinically representative. Samples were exposed to BH using 10- or 1-ms pulses with 1% duty cycle under real-time B-mode and Doppler imaging. Volumetric lesions were created by sonicating 1-4 rectangular planes spaced 1 mm apart, containing a grid of foci spaced 1-2 mm apart. Tissue then was evaluated grossly and histologically, and the lesion content was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Observed shear wave elastography characterization of ex vivo prostate tissue (37.9 ± 22.2 kPa) was within the typical range observed clinically. During BH, hyperechoic regions were visualized at the focus on B-mode, and BH-induced bubbles were also detected using power Doppler. As treatment progressed, hypoechoic regions of tissue appeared, suggesting successful tissue fractionation. BH treatment was twofold faster using shorter pulses (1 ms vs. 10 ms). Histological analysis revealed lesions containing completely homogenized cell debris, consistent with histotripsy-induced mechanical ablation. It was therefore determined that BH is feasible in fresh ex vivo human prostate tissue producing desired mechanical ablation. The study supports further work aimed at translating BH technology as a clinical option for prostate ablation.",1
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer types. Early detection of PC offers the best chance of successful treatment. A noninvasive, image-guided therapy mediated by targeted nanoparticles (NPs) has the potential to improve the efficacy and safety of cancer therapies. Herein, we report a sonosensitive nanoparticle modified with anti-PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) antibodies to activate target prostate tumors. These nanoparticles (PFP@IR780@PTX@liposome NPs) were co-loaded with the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel and the sonosensitizer IR780, as well as phase-changeable perfluorocarbon (PFC) liquids. The liquid-gas phase change could be induced by low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) in vitro. We found that the PFP@IR780@PTX@liposome NPs can specifically accumulate in prostate tumors after LIFU irradiation, as monitored by ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. Meanwhile, docetaxel was controllably released from the nanoparticles to achieve enhanced chemotherapeutic therapy in vivo. These sonosensitive phase-changeable NPs can visually treat prostate cancers effectively and have a clinical potential.",1
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies in men, but patient outcomes are varied depending on extent of disease. Radical, whole-gland therapies, such as prostatectomy or radiotherapy, are definitive treatments for PCa, but they are associated with significant morbidity, including erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. Focal therapies for PCa, whereby the part of gland harboring disease is selectively treated, spares the normal surrounding structures, and minimizes the morbidity associated with whole gland treatment. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance provides advantages over ultrasound guidance, such as better localization and targeting of clinically significant PCa (csPCa), as well as MRI thermometry which optimizes tissue ablation temperatures. This review will discuss two MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) techniques - transrectal MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) and TULSA (transurethral ultrasound ablation) ablation for localized PCa. Overall, recent major trials for MRgFUS and TULSA have shown promising oncological and functional results in the treatment of low- to intermediate-risk PCa. Recent Phase II MRgFUS trials have shown better oncologic outcomes than the published results for focal ultrasound guided HIFU and may justify the additional costs associated with MRI guidance. While initial studies on TULSA have focused on subtotal gland ablation, recent trials assessing oncological outcomes for focal treatment of angular sectors have shown promise.",1
"UNLABELLED: The non-perfused volume (NPV) is an important indicator of treatment success immediately after prostate ablation. However, visualization of the NPV first requires an injection of MRI contrast agents into the bloodstream, which has many downsides. Purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning model capable of predicting the NPV immediately after prostate ablation therapy without the need for MRI contrast agents. A modified 2D deep learning UNet model was developed to predict the post-treatment NPV. MRI imaging data from 95 patients who had previously undergone prostate ablation therapy for treatment of localized prostate cancer were used to train, validate, and test the model. Model inputs were T1/T2-weighted and thermometry MRI images, which were always acquired without any MRI contrast agents and prior to the final NPV image on treatment-day. Model output was the predicted NPV. Model accuracy was assessed using the Dice-Similarity Coefficient (DSC) by comparing the predicted to ground truth NPV. A radiologist also performed a qualitative assessment of NPV. Mean (std) DSC score for predicted NPV was 85% ± 8.1% compared to ground truth. Model performance was significantly better for slices with larger prostate radii (> 24 mm) and for whole-gland rather than partial ablation slices. The predicted NPV was indistinguishable from ground truth for 31% of images. Feasibility of predicting NPV using a UNet model without MRI contrast agents was clearly established. If developed further, this could improve patient treatment outcomes and could obviate the need for contrast agents altogether. Trial Registration Numbers Three studies were used to populate the data: NCT02766543, NCT03814252 and NCT03350529.

"Magnetic resonance-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) is an established method for producing localized hyperthermia. Given the real-time imaging and acoustic energy modulation, this modality enables precise temperature control within a defined area. Many thermal applications are being explored with this noninvasive, nonionizing technology, such as hyperthermia generation, to release drugs from thermosensitive liposomal carriers. These drugs can include chemotherapies such as doxorubicin, for which targeted release is desired due to the dose-limiting systemic side effects, namely cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin is a mainstay for treating a variety of malignant tumors and is commonly used in relapsed or recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). RMS is the most common solid soft tissue extracranial tumor in children and young adults. Despite aggressive, multimodal therapy, RMS survival rates have remained the same for the past 30 years. To explore a solution for addressing this unmet need, an experimental protocol was developed to evaluate the release of thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (TLD) in an immunocompetent, syngeneic RMS mouse model using MRgHIFU as the source of hyperthermia for drug release.",1
"AIM: To explore the efficacy and possible mechanisms of Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) in alleviating spasticity caused by Spinal cord injury (SCI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We selected male Sprague?Dawley rats as subjects and performed transverse injuries on the T9 vertebra of their spinal cord (SC) to build SCI. On the 7th day after SCI, LIFU treatment was performed below the SCI segment once a day for 20 min, for 4 consecutive weeks. During treatment, a pressure sensor was used to assess the degree of spasticity. After treatment, the SC tissues from the treatment sites of the SCI+LIFU(-) and SCI+LIFU(+) groups were extracted, and high-throughput sequencing was performed to identify the changes in proteomics. In addition, expression of the growth associated protein 43 (Gap43) was validated by western blotting. RESULTS: The behavioral results suggested that after 2 weeks of SCI, the rats were significantly induced to have a spastic reaction (p < 0.05), while after 4 weeks of LIFU treatment, the spastic response of rats was significantly improved (p < 0.05). Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in Gap43 expression in the SCI+LIFU(-) group compared with the sham group, whereas after 4 weeks of LIFU treatment, Gap43 protein expression was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that LIFU is an alternative treatment that can effectively relieve spastic reactions caused by SCI, possibly by reducing abnormal neuroplasticity or axon regeneration below the SCI segment.",1
"BACKGROUND: We aimed to prepare a non-invasive, reproducible, and controllable rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage with focused ultrasound (FUS). METHODS: A rat intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) model was established by combining FUS and microbubbles (μBs), and edaravone was used to verify whether the free radical scavenger had a protective effect on the model. The brain tissue of each group was sectioned to observe the gross histology, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, cerebral infarction volume, and histopathological changes. RESULTS: Compared with the FUS group, the BBB permeability was significantly increased in the FUS + μBs (F&B) group (p = 0.0021). The second coronal slice in the F&B group had an obvious hemorrhage lesion, and the FUS + μBs + edaravone (F&B&E) group had smaller hemorrhage areas; however, ICH did not occur in the FUS group. The cerebral infarction volume in the F&B group was significantly larger than that in the FUS group (p = 0.0030) and F&B&E group (p = 0.0208). HE staining results showed that nerve fibrinolysis, neuronal necrosis, microglia production, and erythrocytes were found in both the F&B group and the F&B&E group, but the areas of the nerve fibrinolysis and neuronal necrosis in the F&B group were larger than the F&B&E group. CONCLUSIONS: A rat ICH model was successfully prepared using the μBs assisted FUS treatment, and edaravone had a therapeutic effect on this model. This model can be used to study the pathophysiological mechanism of ICH-related diseases and in preclinical research on related new drugs.",1
"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality around the world, and surgery is still the most direct and effective way to remove ICH. However, the potential risks brought by surgery, such as normal brain tissue damage, post-operative infection, and difficulty in removing deep hematoma, are still the main problems in the surgical treatment of ICH. Activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is reported to show a good therapeutic effect in hematoma clearance. Herein, a magnetic targeting nanocarrier loaded with a PPARγ agonist (15d-PGJ2-MNPs) is synthesized, which could be magnetically targeted and enriched in the area of the hematoma after intravenous injection. Subsequent application of focusing ultrasound (FUS) could enhance drug diffusion, which activates the PPARγ receptors on macrophages around the hematoma for better hematoma clearance. The 15d-PGJ2-MNP treatment alleviates brain injury, accelerates hematoma clearance, attenuates neuroinflammation, reduces brain edema and significantly improves the deficits in sensory and motor function and spatial learning ability in the ICH mouse model. This work proposes an effective magnetic targeting plus FUS method to treat ICH, highlighting its great potential in the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke.",1
"Objective.High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can induce thermal and mechanical mechanisms in a well-defined focal volume of tissues. Histotripsy is a form of mechanical HIFU that can initiate and interact with bubble(s) to cause shock scattering and perhaps atomization within the bubble(s) to fractionate most soft tissues. Ultrasonic atomization, or the ejection of fine droplets from an acoustically-excited liquid exposed to air, has been shown to erode planar soft tissue surfaces, which has led to theories that atomization is a mechanism in histotripsy. However, healthy tendons show resistance to conventional histotripsy; pre-treatment of tendons with heat increases susceptibility to histotripsy fractionation. This study investigates ultrasonic atomization and erosion from planar healthy and tendinopathic tendon surfaces as we evaluate HIFU parameters for histotripsy in tendons.Approach.Forty-sixex vivobovine tendon-air interfaces were pre-conditioned to surface wetting, heat baths of 20 °C (unaltered), 37 °C (body temperature), and 58 °C (collagen degradation), collagenase soaks for 1, 3, 5, and 24 h (mimicking tendinopathic tendons), and phosphate buffered saline soaks for 24 h. Ejected fragments, histology, and gross analysis determined erosion success. Tissue displacement from the HIFU radiation force was monitored with high-speed photography, and tissue relaxation was pixel-tracked and fit to a Kelvin-Voigt model to evaluate changes in viscoelastic properties.Main results.Results showed that atomization produced holes in 24 h collagenase tendons and surface pitting in 58 °C, 3 h, and 5 h collagenase tendons. Increased mound heights and viscoelastic constants in pre-heated (to 58 °C) and collagenase-soaking (3+ hours) tendinopathic models caused a decrease in elasticity and/or increase in viscosity, increasing susceptibility to erosion by HIFU atomization.Significance.Therefore, tendons with chronic tendinopathies may be more susceptible than healthy tendons to histotripsy fractionation.",1
"PURPOSE: To determine efficacy and safety of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation of uterine fibroids (UFs). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed women undergoing HIFU ablation for UFs between June 2018 and January 2020. Before and after HIFU, patients underwent CEUS and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. The relationship between CEUS features and ablation rate was analyzed. The time-intensity curves on CEUS were measured before and after HIFU ablation, and compared with those obtained using MRI. Adverse reactions were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included. The immediate HIFU ablation rate significantly differed between low-, iso-, and high-enhancement UFs (87.2% ± 1.6%, 83.3% ± 2.1%, and 72.9% ± 3.1%, respectively; p < 0.05). On CEUS, the peak time of the time-intensity curve was significantly longer after treatment than before treatment (32.2 ± 9.7 and 26.7 ± 9.4 s, respectively; p < 0.05). Peak intensity was significantly lower after treatment than before treatment (13.7 ± 7.5 and 30.9 ± 11.2 dB, respectively; p < 0.05). All measurements were comparable between CEUS and MRI. The most common peri- and post-procedure adverse reaction was pain, which was temporary. CONCLUSION: CEUS could dynamically and safely evaluate the immediate effects of the HIFU ablation of UFs.",1
"AIM: To study the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters in predicting the efficacy of ultrasonic ablation of fibroids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 91 patients were divided into groups based on non-perfused volume (NPV) ratio and blood supply type. The preoperative MRI parameters were measured and analysed. A correlation analysis between the MRI parameters and the NPV ratio was performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyse and determine the cut-off value of MRI parameters to predict the ablation rate of fibroids. RESULTS: The uterine fibroids group with an NPV ratio <80% and the group with an NPV ratio of ≥80% had significant differences in signal intensity (SI) at MRI T2-weighted imaging (WI), fibroid-to-rectus abdominis SI ratio (SIR) at T2WI, and blood supply type (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in fibroid volume, T2WI signal uniformity, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. The ADC value and SI and SIR at MRI T2WI in the group with poor blood supply were lower than those in the group with a rich blood supply (p<0.05). SI at MRI T2WI correlated negatively with the NPV ratio. The cut-off values for SI and SIR at MRI T2WI of fibroids whose NPV ratio exceeds 80% were 220.58 and 1.315, respectively. CONCLUSION: SI at MRI T2WI and blood supply type could be predictors of the efficacy of ablation. Ultrasonic ablation of fibroids with MRI T2WI hyperintensity and a rich blood supply had poor efficacy.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in healthy women. High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a modern, noninvasive thermal ablation method for treating uterine fibroids. There is increasing evidence that ultrasound guided HIFU (US-HIFU) has no adverse impact on ovarian reserve but little data exists on magnetic resonance guided HIFU (MR-HIFU). There are different options to estimate ovarian reserve, perhaps the most reliable being the measurement of serum Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-four (74) premenopausal women with serum AMH 0.1 ug/L or over, aged 24-48 and with fibroids or adenomyosis treated with MR-HIFU were enrolled in our study. AMH levels were analyzed before and 3 months after the MR-HIFU treatment. Correlations between AMH level changes and position of fibroids, fibroid volume, non-perfused volume ratio, and treatment energies were studied. RESULTS: The median AMH level before the HIFU treatment was 1.20 (range: 0.1-7.75 ug/L) and after the treatment 1.23 (range: 0.1-8.51 ug/L). No significant change was detected (p = .90). The patients were divided in three subgroups depending on the baseline AMH levels. The changes were not significant in any of the subgroups. Neither did the location of the treated fibroid affect the change of AMH levels nor the total energy used during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MR-HIFU does not compromise the ovarian reserve. Neither the location of the treated fibroid nor the total energy used during MR-HIFU had any effect on the change of AMH levels.",1
"OBJECTIVES: To determine the value of dual-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics in predicting the efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation for hysteromyoma. METHODS: A total of 142 patients with 172 hysteromyomas (95 hysteromyomas from the sufficient ablation group, and 77 hysteromyomas from the insufficient ablation group) were enrolled in the study. The clinical-radiological model was constructed with independent clinical-radiological risk factors, the radiomics model was constructed based on the optimal radiomics features of hysteromyoma from dual sequences, and the two groups of features were incorporated to construct the combined model. A fivefold cross validation procedure was adopted to validate these models. A nomogram was constructed, applying the combined model in the training cohort. The models were assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). An independent test cohort comprising 40 patients was used to evaluate the performance of the optimal model. RESULTS: Among the three models, the average areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of the radiomics model and combined model were 0.803 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.726-0.881) and 0.841 (95% CI: 0.772-0.909), which were better than the clinical-radiological model in the training cohort. The IDI showed that the combined model had the best prediction accuracy. The combined model also showed good discrimination in both the validation cohort (AUC = 0.834) and the independent test cohort (AUC = 0.801). CONCLUSION: The combined model based on the dual-sequence MRI radiomics is the most promising tool from our study to assist clinicians in predicting HIFU ablation efficacy.",1
"BACKGROUND: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is used for the treatment of symptomatic leiomyomas. We aim to automate uterine volumetry for tracking changes after therapy with a 3D deep learning approach. METHODS: A 3D nnU-Net model in the default setting and in a modified version including convolutional block attention modules (CBAMs) was developed on 3D T2-weighted MRI scans. Uterine segmentation was performed in 44 patients with routine pelvic MRI (standard group) and 56 patients with uterine fibroids undergoing ultrasound-guided HIFU therapy (HIFU group). Here, preHIFU scans (n = 56), postHIFU imaging maximum one day after HIFU (n = 54), and the last available follow-up examination (n = 53, days after HIFU: 420 ± 377) were included. The training was performed on 80% of the data with fivefold cross-validation. The remaining data were used as a hold-out test set. Ground truth was generated by a board-certified radiologist and a radiology resident. For the assessment of inter-reader agreement, all preHIFU examinations were segmented independently by both. RESULTS: High segmentation performance was already observed for the default 3D nnU-Net (mean Dice score = 0.95 ± 0.05) on the validation sets. Since the CBAM nnU-Net showed no significant benefit, the less complex default model was applied to the hold-out test set, which resulted in accurate uterus segmentation (Dice scores: standard group 0.92 ± 0.07; HIFU group 0.96 ± 0.02), which was comparable to the agreement between the two readers. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a method for automatic uterus segmentation which allows a fast and consistent assessment of uterine volume. Therefore, this method could be used in the clinical setting for objective assessment of therapeutic response to HIFU therapy.",1
"OBJECTIVES: To compare pregnancy outcomes after high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation (HIFU), myomectomy and uterine artery embolization (UAE) for fertility-sparing patients with uterine fibroids and to investigate the possible mechanism of improving pregnancy by HIFU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis of 54 studies containing 12,367 patients was conducted to compare the pregnancy outcomes of three fertility-sparing therapies. And a retrospective self-control study of 26 patients with uterine fibroids from May 2019 to December 2020 was performed to assess the blood flow impedance of bilateral uterine arteries before and after HIFU. RESULTS: In the analysis by treatment option, the pregnancy rate after myomectomy was 0.43 (95% CI 0.36-0.49), which was higher than 0.18 (95% CI 0.10-0.26) after HIFU, the latter was significantly higher than that after UAE (ratio 0.08, 95% CI 0.06-0.10). The miscarriage rate after HIFU was 0.08 (95% CI 0.04-0.12), which was similar to 0.15 (95% CI 0.09-0.21) after myomectomy and also similar to 0.16 after UAE (95% CI 0.01-0.30). In the subgroup analysis, women who received ultrasound guided HIFU (USgHIFU) were more likely to have ideal pregnancy outcomes than that after magnetic resonance imaging-guided HIFU. The pulsatility index and resistance index on the right side were significantly higher 3 months after HIFU than before (1.637 ± 0.435 vs. 1.845 ± 0.469; p = 0.033; 0.729 ± 0.141 vs. 0.784 ± 0.081, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: HIFU, especially USgHIFU, may be an alternative fertility-sparing modality for patients with uterine fibroids over 40 years old. HIFU may contribute to improving pregnancy rates by elevating uterine blood flow impedance.",1
"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) for the treatment of an adenomyosis model of Bama pigs and the changes in the level of oxytocin receptor (OTR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the myometrium tissues of Bama pigs after MRgFUS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three Bama pig models of adenomyosis were established by autologous endometrial implantation and evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. After the successful construction of the model, the pigs underwent MRgFUS. Before the modeling surgery, three months after the modeling, and two months after ablation, the myometrium tissues were clipped, then embedded and H&E stained for immunohistochemical examination. The average optical density of OTR, VEGF, and COX-2 were semi-quantitatively analyzed. RESULTS: The adenomyosis models were established in all Bama pigs and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and H&E staining. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography examination showed that the uterine wall at the modeling site was significantly thickened with uneven enhancement after contrast injection. All Bama pigs with adenomyosis lesions underwent MRgFUS without complications. The expression level of OTR and COX-2 in the myometrium increased three months after modeling surgery and decreased two months after MRgFUS. The expression level of VEGF decreased two months after MRgFUS. CONCLUSION: Autologous endometrial implantation is effective in establishing the adenomyosis model of Bama pigs. It is feasible to treat adenomyosis in the Bama pig model with MRgFUS. The levels of OTR, COX-2 and VEGF in the local myometrium decreased after MRgFUS, which may be associated with symptom relief after treatment.",1
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of the combination of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), mifepristone, and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in adenomyosis treatment. METHODS: HIFU treatment was performed in 123 patients with symptomatic adenomyosis who had refused treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) at Anyang Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital. In the control group, 34 patients were treated with HIFU alone, 29 patients with HIFU combined with mifepristone, 10 patients with HIFU combined with LNG-IUS. In the study group, 50 patients were treated with HIFU combined with mifepristone and LNG-IUS. RESULTS: Uterine volume, dysmenorrhea pain score, menstruation volume score, and serum CA125 level were significantly lower after treatment with HIFU combined with mifepristone and LNG-IUS than before treatment (p < .05). Moreover, hemoglobin level was significantly higher than that before treatment (p < .05). After 24 months, the efficacy of HIFU combined with mifepristone and LNG-IUS was significantly higher than that of HIFU alone, HIFU combined with mifepristone or HIFU with LNG-IUS (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy of HIFU, mifepristone, and LNG-IUS is an effective, safe, and inexpensive treatment for patients with symptomatic adenomyosis. This combination therapy demonstrates superior efficacy to treatment with HIFU alone, HIFU combined with mifepristone, and HIFU combined with LNG-IUS.",1
"This article discusses the use of High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) as a minimally invasive therapy for the treatment of various pathologies. It proposes an alternative solution of replacing the computationally expensive direct solver with a surrogate model built from a database of simulation results. This procedure and its related tools have been implemented in CIVA-HealthCare and two applications are presented to highlight the potential offered by such intensive HIFU simulation based on surrogate models strategy. The article also discusses the use of a dedicated GUI to simulate 3D pressure fields in biological tissues, as well as the use of a temperature rise and thermal dose computation module to estimate the shape, position, and degree of thermal damage within the tissue.

"This article reviews the use of MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy for essential tremor, a neurological disorder. It discusses the effects of acoustic power, thermal dose, lesion size, and other factors on the efficacy of the procedure. It also examines the correlation between skull metrics and SDR (skull density ratio) to determine the best indicator of treatment parameters. Machine learning algorithms were used to predict maximum power and energy required from the local and overall SDRs. The results suggest that evaluation of alternative skull features may improve prediction of treatment parameters and facilitate patient selection and counseling.",1
"This study aimed to identify the most important features from clinical patient data for high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy outcome classification in uterine fibroids. Data was collected from 66 patients with 89 uterine fibroids treated with Sonalleve V2 (Profound Medical, Mississauga, Canada) therapy system. Results identified the most prominent clinical parameters for HIFU therapy outcome prediction in uterine fibroids, with fibroid diameter and volume being the most important features. The study also examined the effects of GnRH agonist pre-treatment, oxytocin, and T1 perfusion-based classification on the ablation of uterine fibroids. A machine learning model (SVC) was used to take advantage of these features in predicting the treatment outcome.",1
"This article reviews current medical treatments for uterine fibroids, including Uterine Artery Embolization, High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation, and Magnetic Resonance-Guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery. It also examines the use of magnetic resonance imaging parameters and machine learning algorithms to predict the prognosis of high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of uterine fibroids. Results showed that postoperative non-perfused volume and residual fibroid volume were the most important features influencing NPV reduction, while maximum residual fibroid thickness and basal distribution of residual fibroids were the most important features for predicting residual fibroid regrowth. The study also found that younger women were more likely to develop residual fibroid regrowth. The best model for predicting NPV reduction was multilayer perceptron with an R2 of 0.907, and the best model for predicting residual fibroid regrowth was random forest with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.904.",1
"This article discusses the use of machine learning algorithms to model the response of focused ultrasound for non-invasive treatment. A dataset of 19,227 simulations was used to train several machine learning models, with the random forest model providing superior accuracy. This approach could improve the therapeutic planning process by minimizing simulation time. The model was tested using standard statistical performance metrics and found to be most effective with the Random Forest algorithm. The model was further tested using external data points and found to be effective in predicting maximum pressure, power deposition, and temperature rise in the focus during ultrasonic surgery or hyperthermia. The study concluded that the model could be further enriched by adding different tissue properties and transducer geometries.",1
"This paper presents a novel approach to real-time 3D temperature visualization for thermal ablation procedures, such as high intensity focused ultrasound and radiofrequency ablation, using photon-counting computed tomography (CT) and a neural network to predict temperature. The neural network was trained on experimental data and achieved a mean absolute error of 3.97°C and 1.80°C on 300 mmol/L CaCl2 and a milk-based protein shake respectively. This approach is promising for handling non-linear thermal properties for materials similar or dissimilar to the base materials. The article also discusses the use of X-ray thermography for three-dimensional imaging, and provides links to datasets, NIST data, and other research papers related to X-ray photon-counting data correction and EM estimation of X-ray spectrums.",1
"This study investigated the use of radiomics and machine learning to predict the outcome of HIFU ablation of uterine leiomyomas. The ReliefF-SVM model showed favorable predictive performance, with an average accuracy of 0.849, sensitivity of 0.814, specificity of 0.896, positive predictive value of 0.903, negative predictive value of 0.823, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.887. The results showed that the quantitative radiomics features from preoperative MR images could effectively describe the degree of difficulty in HIFU ablation of uterine leiomyomas.",1
"This article discusses an intelligent HIFU therapy system for uterine fibroids, which combines preoperative and intraoperative medical images, noninvasive HIFU therapy, and a real-time image guidance system to provide an automatic and accurate diagnosis and treatment strategy. Experiments have shown that the proposed system is feasible for treating common uterine fibroid cases and can reach the level of operation performed by senior doctors. The system was evaluated for preoperative MR image segmentation accuracy, intraoperative ultrasound lesion tracking accuracy, and clinical experiments. The results showed that the proposed system had better robustness for HIFU ultrasound images and a faster calculation speed than the conventional method.",1
"This study used machine learning algorithms to predict the treatment outcome of uterine fibroids with an immediate NPV ratio of at least 90%. It found that the Ktrans ratio of the fibroid to the myometrium was the highest-ranking feature for predicting the treatment outcome, and that there was a significant negative correlation between the Ktrans of the fibroid and the NPV ratio. The study also looked at the effects of ultrasound-guided high intensity focused ultrasound for single uterine fibroids, the analysis of tissue and arterial blood temperatures in the resting human forearm, the proof and measurement of association between two things, and an introduction to ROC analysis.",1
"This article discusses the use of deep learning methods for automated segmentation of the uterus in MRI scans, enabling objective assessment of therapeutic response to high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy. Two neural networks were trained and compared, a standard 3D U-Net and a modified U-Net using additional convolutional block attention modules (CBAMs) in the encoder. Results showed that the modified version with CBAMs improved the focus on relevant image information and its location. The mean performance of the two models was very similar, with a mean Dice score of 0.95 and a mean relative volume difference of 3.79%. The study also discussed the use of CT angiography to detect aneurysms, deep transfer learning to detect liver cirrhosis, and split-and-merge and multi-seed region growing algorithms for uterine fibroid segmentation in MRgFUS treatments.",1
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a rapidly developing medical technology that allows non-invasive thermal ablation of tumors. Thermal treatment of liver tumor, which is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, is problematic because large blood vessels act as a heat sink. Convective cooling protects the cancer cells from thermal destruction and decreases the necrosed volume. A major objective of the method development is to achieve a virtually complete necrosis of tumors close to major blood vessels and to avoid blood vessel damage and, hence, the needed treatment planning. The present study is aimed at predicting liver tumor temperature during HIFU thermal ablation in a patient-specific liver geometry. The model comprises the nonlinear Westervelt equation and bioheat equations in the liver and blood vessels. The nonlinear hemodynamic equations are also taken into account with the convected cooling and acoustic streaming effects being taken into account. We found from this three-dimensional three-field coupling study that in large blood vessels, both convective cooling and acoustic streaming may change the temperature considerably near the blood vessel. More precisely, acoustic streaming velocity magnitude can be several times larger than the blood vessel velocity. The results presented in the current work can be further used to construct a surgical planning platform.",1
"Novel approaches for predicting the outcomes of blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening with focused ultrasound (FUS) and microbubbles are highly desired. This study aims to explore machine learning-based methods for reliably predicting the FUS-induced BBB opening efficacy and safety. Methods: Sixteen female rats were used in this study. An acoustic feedback-controlled FUS system (f0: 0.5MHz) was used for the BBB opening with the infusion of custom-made nanobubbles/Definity. Evans Blue was injected for the BBB opening efficacy verification and the brain tissue was harvested for the safety assessment. Acoustic emissions were recorded, preprocessed and fed into three machine learning models for BBB opening outcomes prediction. Conventional stable and inertial cavitation dose were also calculated. Results: Among the tested machine learning models, a modified Support Vector Data Description (mSVDD) model achieved the best performance in the BBB opening efficacy and safety prediction with an accuracy of 85.0+/-16.6% and 62.5+/-12.8%, respectively. Conventional stable and inertial cavitation dose-based prediction has a prediction accuracy of 80.0% in efficacy and 34.3% in safety, respectively. The mSVDD model trained with the overall bubble response (0-2 MHz) performed better than that trained with the ultra-harmonic bubble response (0.7-0.8 MHz) in both efficacy prediction (85.0+/-16.6% vs 76.0+/-8.0%, p=0.04) and safety prediction (62.5+/-12.8% vs 55.0+/-10.7%, p>0.05). It is also found that the mSVDD model trained with nanobubble data cannot be directly applied to Definity. Conclusion: Our investigations demonstrated that it is feasible to achieve a reliable prediction of FUS-induced BBB opening outcomes with machine learning and acoustic signals from stimulated nanobubbles. This study provided a new approach for the prediction of FUS-BBB opening outcomes with a clinical translation potential.",1
"This study developed an office-based cardiovascular risk calculator using a machine learning (ML) algorithm that utilized a focused carotid ultrasound. The design of this study was divided into three steps. The first step involved collecting 18 office-based biomarkers consisting of six clinical risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and smoking) and 12 carotid ultrasound image-based phenotypes. The second step consisted of the design of an ML-based cardiovascular risk calculator-called “AtheroEdge Composite Risk Score 2.0” (AECRS2.0ML) for risk stratification, considering chronic kidney disease (CKD) as the surrogate endpoint of cardiovascular disease. The last step consisted of comparing AECRS2.0ML against the currently utilized office-based CVD calculators, namely the Framingham risk score (FRS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) risk scores. A cohort of 379 Asian-Indian patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (stage 1 to 5) were recruited for this cross-sectional study. From this retrospective cohort, 758 ultrasound scan images were acquired from the far walls of the left and right common carotid arteries [mean age = 55 ± 10.8 years, 67.28% males, 91.82% diabetic, 86.54% hypertensive, and 83.11% with CKD]. The mean office-based cardiovascular risk estimates using FRS and WHO calculators were 26% and 19%, respectively. AECRS2.0ML demonstrated a better risk stratification ability having a higher area-under-the-curve against FRS and WHO by ~30% (0.871 vs. 0.669) and ~ 20% (0.871 vs. 0.727), respectively. The office-based machine-learning cardiovascular risk-stratification tool (AECRS2.0ML) shows superior performance compared to currently available conventional cardiovascular risk calculators.",1
"Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) constitutes a noninvasive treatment strategy to ablate deep-seated bone metastases. However, limited evidence suggests that, although cytokines are influenced by thermal necrosis, there is still no cytokine threshold for clinical responses. A prediction model to approximate the postablation immune status on the basis of circulating cytokine activation is thus needed. IL-6 and IP-10, which are proinflammatory cytokines, decreased significantly during the acute phase. Wound-healing cytokines such as VEGF and PDGF increased after ablation, but the increase was not statistically significant. In this phase, IL-6, IL-13, IP-10, and eotaxin expression levels diminished the ongoing inflammatory progression in the treated sites. These cytokine changes also correlated with the response rate of primary tumor control after acute periods. The few-shot learning algorithm was applied to test the correlation between cytokine levels and local control (p = 0.036). The best-fitted model included IL-6, IL-13, IP-10, and eotaxin as cytokine parameters from the few-shot selection, and had an accuracy of 85.2%, sensitivity of 88.6%, and AUC of 0.95. The acceptable usage of this model may help predict the acute-phase prognosis of a patient with painful bone metastasis who underwent local MRgFUS. The application of machine learning in bone metastasis is equivalent or better than the current logistic regression.  HIFU",1
"Objectives: To develop and apply magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameter-based machine learning (ML) models to predict non-perfused volume (NPV) reduction and residual regrowth of uterine fibroids after high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation. Methods: MRI data of 573 uterine fibroids in 410 women who underwent HIFU ablation from the Chongqing Haifu Hospital (training set, N = 405) and the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (testing set, N = 168) were retrospectively analyzed. Fourteen MRI parameters were screened for important predictors using the Boruta algorithm. Multiple ML models were constructed to predict NPV reduction and residual fibroid regrowth in a median of 203.0 (interquartile range: 122.5–367.5) days. Furthermore, optimal models were used to plot prognostic prediction curves. Results: Fourteen features, including postoperative NPV, indicated predictive ability for NPV reduction. Based on the 10-fold cross-validation, the best average performance of multilayer perceptron achieved with R2 was 0.907. In the testing set, the best model was linear regression (R2 =0.851). Ten features, including the maximum thickness of residual fibroids, revealed predictive power for residual fibroid regrowth. Random forest model achieved the best performance with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.904 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.869–0.939), which was maintained in the testing set with an AUC of 0.891 (95% CI, 0.850–0.929). Conclusions: ML models based on MRI parameters can be used for prognostic prediction of uterine fibroids after HIFU ablation. They can potentially serve as a new method for learning more about ablated fibroids.",1
"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is gaining rapid clinical acceptance as a treatment modality enabling non-invasive tissue heating and ablation for numerous applications. HIFU treatments are usually carried out in a single session, often as a day case procedure, with the patient either fully conscious, lightly sedated or under light general anaesthesia. A major advantage of HIFU over other thermal ablation techniques is that there is no necessity for the transcutaneous insertion of probes into the target tissue. The high powered focused beams employed are generated from sources placed either outside the body (for treatment of tumours of the liver, kidney, breast, uterus, pancreas and bone) or in the rectum (for treatment of the prostate), and are designed to enable rapid heating of a target tissue volume, while leaving tissue in the ultrasound propagation path relatively unaffected. Given the wide-ranging applicability of HIFU, numerous extra-corporeal, transrectal and interstitial devices have been designed to optimise application-specific treatment delivery. Their principle of operation is described here, alongside an overview of the physical mechanisms governing HIFU propagation and HIFU-induced heating. Present methods of characterising HIFU fields and of quantifying HIFU exposure and its associated effects are also addressed.",1
"Traditionally, surgery has been the only cure for many solid tumours. Technological advances have catalysed a shift from open surgery towards less invasive techniques. Laparoscopic surgery and minimally invasive techniques continue to evolve, but for decades high-intensity focused ultrasound has promised to deliver the ultimate objective — truly non-invasive tumour ablation. Only now, however, with recent improvements in imaging, has this objective finally emerged as a real clinical possibility.",1
"MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) surgery is a noninvasive thermal ablation method that uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for target definition, treatment planning, and closed-loop control of energy deposition. Integrating FUS and MRI as a therapy delivery system allows us to localize, target, and monitor in real time, and thus to ablate targeted tissue without damaging normal structures. This precision makes MRgFUS an attractive alternative to surgical resection or radiation therapy of benign and malignant tumors. Already approved for the treatment of uterine fibroids, MRgFUS is in ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of breast, liver, prostate, and brain cancer and for the palliation of pain in bone metastasis. In addition to thermal ablation, FUS, with or without the use of microbubbles, can temporarily change vascular or cell membrane permeability and release or activate various compounds for targeted drug delivery or gene therapy. A disruptive technology, MRgFUS provides new therapeutic approaches and may cause major changes in patient management and several medical disciplines.",1
"Image-guided focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) effectively combines two technologies, MR imaging or US and FUS, into an image-guided therapy delivery system for noninvasive tumor ablation or the targeted delivery of drugs, both of which can either replace or complement surgery or radiation therapy. Focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) is a noninvasive image-guided therapy and an alternative to surgical interventions. It presents an opportunity to revolutionize cancer therapy and to affect or change drug delivery of therapeutic agents in new focally targeted ways. In this article the background, principles, technical devices, and clinical cancer applications of image-guided FUS are reviewed.",1
"Ultrasonography is a safe, inexpensive and wide-spread diagnostic tool capable of producing real-time non-invasive images without significant biological effects. However, the propagation of higher energy, intensity and frequency ultrasound waves through living tissues can induce thermal, mechanical and chemical effects useful for a variety of therapeutic applications. With the recent development of clinically approved High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) systems, therapeutic ultrasound is now a medical reality. Indeed, HIFU has been used for the thermal ablation of pathological lesions; localized, minimally invasive ultrasound-mediated drug delivery through the transient formation of pores on cell membranes; the temporary disruption of skin and the blood brain barrier; the ultrasound induced break-down of blood clots; and the targeted release of drugs using ultrasound and temperature sensitive drug carriers. This review seeks to engage the pharmaceutical research community by providing an overview on the biological effects of ultrasound as well as highlighting important therapeutic applications, current deficiencies and future directions.",1
"Recent advances in molecular neurooncology provide unique opportunities for targeted molecular-based therapies. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a major limitation to the delivery of tumor-specific therapies directed against aberrant signaling pathways in brain tumors. Given the dismal prognosis of patients with malignant brain tumors, novel strategies that overcome the intrinsic limitations of the BBB are therefore highly desirable. Focused ultrasound BBB disruption is emerging as a novel strategy for enhanced delivery of therapeutic agents into the brain via focal, reversible, and safe BBB disruption. This review examines the potential role and implications of focused ultrasound in molecular neurooncology.",1
"Pulsed focused ultrasound can stimulate the receptor and conductive nerve structures of humans and animals as well as the neurons of the central nervous system of invertebrates. The possibility of a wide practical use of this method in medicine and physiology is considered. For example, the stimulating ability of focused ultrasound is applied to the diagnosis of neurological diseases, to the study of skin and tissue sensitivity in man, to the diagnosis of hearing disorders, and to the introduction of auditory information to the deaf with certain forms of hearing pathology. The factors that affect focused ultrasound as a stimulus for the irritation of nerve structures are discussed.",1
"Background: In this paper an MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) robotic system was developed that can be used for conducting experiments in small animals.The target for this robotic system regarding motion was to move a therapeutic ultrasound transducer in two Cartesian axes. Methods: A single element spherically focused transducer of 3 cm diameter, focusing at 7 cm and operating at 0.4 MHz was used. The positioning device incorporates only MRI compatible materials. The propagation of ultrasound is a bottom to top approach. The 2-D positioning device is controlled by custom-made software and a custom-made electronic system which controls the two piezoelectric motors. Results: The system was tested successfully in agar/silica/evaporated milk phantom for various tasks (robot motion, MR compatibility, and MR thermometry). The robotic system is capable of moving the focused ultrasound transducer to perform MR-guided focused ultrasound experiments in small animals. Conclusions: This system has the potential to be deployed as a cost effective solution for performing experiments in small animals. Keywords: MRI; robot; ultrasound.",1
"Focused ultrasound (FUS) therapies induce therapeutic effects in localized tissues using either temperature elevations or mechanical stresses caused by an ultrasound wave. During an FUS therapy, it is crucial to continuously monitor the position of the FUS beam in order to correct for tissue motion and keep the focus within the target region. Toward the goal of achieving real-time monitoring for FUS therapies, we have developed a method for the real-time visualization of an FUS beam using ultrasonic backscatter. The intensity field of an FUS beam was reconstructed using backscatter from an FUS pulse received by an imaging array and then overlaid onto a B-mode image captured using the same imaging array. The FUS beam visualization allows one to monitor the position and extent of the FUS beam in the context of the surrounding medium. Variations in the scattering properties of the medium were corrected in the FUS beam reconstruction by normalizing based on the echogenicity of the coaligned B-mode image. On average, normalizing by echogenicity reduced the mean square error between FUS beam reconstructions in nonhomogeneous regions of a phantom and baseline homogeneous regions by 21.61. FUS beam visualizations were achieved, using a single diagnostic imaging array as both an FUS source and an imaging probe, in a tissue-mimicking phantom and a rat tumor in vivo with a frame rate of 25-30 frames/s.",1
"Background: Focused transthoracic echocardiography (F-TTE) is an important tool to assess hemodynamically unstable patients in the Emergency Department. Although its scope has been defined by the American College of Emergency Physicians, more research is needed to define an optimal F-TTE training program, including assessment of proficiency. Objective: The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of current standards in post-residency training to reach proficiency in F-TTE. Methods: Fourteen staff Emergency Physicians were enrolled in a standardized teaching curriculum specifically designed to meet the 2008 American College of Emergency Physicians' guidelines for general ultrasound training applied to echocardiography. This training program consisted of 6 h of didactics and 6 h of scanning training, followed by independent scanning over a 5-month period. Acquisition of echocardiographic knowledge was assessed by an online pre- and post-test. At the conclusion of the study, a hands-on skills test assessed the trainees' ability to perform and interpret F-TTE. Results: Ninety percent of trainees passed the written post-test. Two views, the parasternal long and short axis, were easily obtainable, regardless of the level of training or the number of ultrasounds completed. Other views were more difficult to master, but strong trends toward increased competency were evident after 10 h of mixed didactic and scanning training and > 45 ultrasounds. Conclusions: A short, 12-h didactic training in F-TTE provided proficiency in image interpretation and in obtaining adequate images from the parasternal window. More extensive training is needed to master the apical and subcostal windows in a timely manner.",1
"Malignant glioma is a severe primary CNS cancer with a high recurrence and mortality rate. The current strategy of surgical debulking combined with radiation therapy or chemotherapy does not provide good prognosis, tumor progression control, or improved patient survival. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) acts as a major obstacle to chemotherapeutic treatment of brain tumors by severely restricting drug delivery into the brain. Because of their high toxicity, chemotherapeutic drugs cannot be administered at sufficient concentrations by conventional delivery methods to significantly improve long-term survival of patients with brain tumors. Temporal disruption of the BBB by microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound (FUS) exposure can increase CNS-blood permeability, providing a promising new direction to increase the concentration of therapeutic agents in the brain tumor and improve disease control. Under the guidance and monitoring of MR imaging, a brain drug-delivery platform can be developed to control and monitor therapeutic agent distribution and kinetics. The success of FUS BBB disruption in delivering a variety of therapeutic molecules into brain tumors has recently been demonstrated in an animal model. In this paper the authors review a number of critical studies that have demonstrated successful outcomes, including enhancement of the delivery of traditional clinically used chemotherapeutic agents or application of novel nanocarrier designs for actively transporting drugs or extending drug half-lives to significantly improve treatment efficacy in preclinical animal models.",1
"Beyond the implementation of the photoacoustic effect to photoacoustic imaging and laser ultrasonics, this study demonstrates a novel application of the photoacoustic effect for high-precision cavitation treatment of tissue using laser-induced focused ultrasound. The focused ultrasound is generated by pulsed optical excitation of an efficient photoacoustic film coated on a concave surface, and its amplitude is high enough to produce controllable microcavitation within the focal region (lateral focus <100 µm). Such microcavitation is used to cut or ablate soft tissue in a highly precise manner. This work demonstrates precise cutting of tissue-mimicking gels as well as accurate ablation of gels and animal eye tissues. Keywords: laser ultrasound; microcavitation; tissue cutting.",1
"This study demonstrates the feasibility of using focused ultrasound (FUS) to modulate glomerular ultrafiltration by renal artery sonication and determine if protein-creatinine ratios are estimated through vascular parameters. All animal experiments were approved by our Animal Care and Use Committee. The renal arteries of Sprague-Dawley rats were surgically exposed and sonicated at various acoustic power levels using a FUS transducer with a resonant frequency of 1 MHz. The mean peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the blood flow was measured by Doppler ultrasound imaging. Urinary protein-creatinine ratios were calculated during the experiments. Histological examination of renal arteries and whole kidneys was performed. The PSV, pulsatility index, and resistance index of blood flow significantly increased in the arteries after FUS sonication without microbubbles (p<0.05). The change in normalized protein-creatinine ratios significantly increased with increasing acoustic power, but such was not observed when microbubbles were administered. Furthermore, no histological changes were observed in the hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections. Glomerular ultrafiltration is regulated temporarily by renal artery sonication without microbubbles. Monitoring vascular parameters are useful in estimating the normalized change in protein-creatinine ratios.",1
"Acoustic cavitation can occur in therapeutic applications of high-amplitude focused ultrasound. Studying acoustic cavitation has been challenging, because the onset of nucleation is unpredictable. We hypothesized that acoustic cavitation can be forced to occur at a specific location using a laser to nucleate a microcavity in a pre-established ultrasound field. In this paper we describe a scientific instrument that is dedicated to this outcome, combining a focused ultrasound transducer with a pulsed laser. We present high-speed photographic observations of laser-induced cavitation and laser-nucleated acoustic cavitation, at frame rates of 0.5×10(6) frames per second, from laser pulses of energy above and below the optical breakdown threshold, respectively. Acoustic recordings demonstrated inertial cavitation can be controllably introduced to the ultrasound focus. This technique will contribute to the understanding of cavitation evolution in focused ultrasound including for potential therapeutic applications.",1
"Objective: To explore the antitumor effects of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) mediated localized drug delivery of adriamycin-microbubble-PLGA nanoparticle complexes on rabbits VX2 liver tumor. Methods: ADM-NMCs were prepared by covalent linking of ADM-PLGA nanoparticles (ADM-NPs) to the shell of the microbubbles. A fixed water bag filled with microbubbles was subjected to LIFU and non-focused ultrasound respectively, and the ultrasound images of which were recorded before and after ultrasonication. A total of 54 VX2 liver tumor-burdened rabbits were divided into six groups randomly, including control, ADM-NPs combined with LIFU, microbubbles combined with LIFU, ADM-NPs and microbubbles combined with LIFU, ADM-NMCs combined with LIFU and ADM-NMCs combined with Non-FUS. The tumor volume and volume inhibition rate (VIR) of tumor progression were calculated and compared. Apoptotic cells were labeled by terminal deoxyuridine nick end. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry. The median survival time of the animals were recorded and compared. Results: ADM-NMCs were successfully prepared with an average diameter of 1721 nm. The highest VIR and apoptotic index (AI) were found in the group of ADM-NMCs combined with LIFU while the lowest proliferating index (PI) was simultaneously observed in this group. The median survival time of the rabbits in the ADM-NMCs combined with LIFU group was the longest (71days) among all groups. Conclusions: ADM-NMCs combined with LIFU could inhibit the rabbits VX2 liver tumor progress by delaying the tumor proliferation and accelerating apoptosis, which presents a novel process for liver tumor targeting chemotherapy. Keywords: ADM-NMCs; LIFU; PLGA nanoparticles; VX2 Liver cancer; microbubble.",1
"Transcranial ultrasound can alter brain function transiently and nondestructively, offering a new tool to study brain function now and inform future therapies. Previous research on neuromodulation implemented pulsed low-frequency (250-700 kHz) ultrasound with spatial peak temporal average intensities (ISPTA) of 0.1-10 W/cm(2). That work used transducers that either insonified relatively large volumes of mouse brain (several mL) with relatively low-frequency ultrasound and produced bilateral motor responses, or relatively small volumes of brain (on the order of 0.06 mL) with relatively high-frequency ultrasound that produced unilateral motor responses. This study seeks to increase anatomical specificity to neuromodulation with modulated focused ultrasound (mFU). Here, 'modulated' means modifying a focused 2-MHz carrier signal dynamically with a 500-kHz signal as in vibro-acoustography, thereby creating a low-frequency but small volume (approximately 0.015 mL) source of neuromodulation. Application of transcranial mFU to lightly anesthetized mice produced various motor movements with high spatial selectivity (on the order of 1 mm) that scaled with the temporal average ultrasound intensity. Alone, mFU and focused ultrasound (FUS) each induced motor activity, including unilateral motions, though anatomical location and type of motion varied. Future work should include larger animal models to determine the relative efficacy of mFU versus FUS. Other studies should determine the biophysical processes through which they act. Also of interest is exploration of the potential research and clinical applications for targeted, transcranial neuromodulation created by modulated focused ultrasound, especially mFU's ability to produce compact sources of ultrasound at the very low frequencies (10-100s of Hertz) that are commensurate with the natural frequencies of the brain.",1
"Focused ultrasound (FUS/HIFU) relies on ablation of pathological tissues by delivering a sufficiently high level of acoustic energy in situ of the human body. Magnetic Resonance guided FUS (MRgFUS/HIFU) and Ultrasound guided (USgFUS/HIFU) are image guided techniques combined with therapeutic FUS for monitoring purposes. The principles and technologies of FUS/HiFU are described in this paper including the basics of MR guidance techniques and MR temperature mapping. Clinical applications of FUS/HIFU gained CE and FDA approvals for the treatment of various benign and few malignant lesions in the last two decades. Current technical limitations of ultrasound guided and MRI guided Focused Ultrasound, as well as adverse effects for the application of this technique are outlined including challenges of ablating moving organs (liver and kidney). An outlook to possible applications is provided; exampling clinical trials discussing future options.",1
"Shock wave lithotripsy has generally been a first choice for kidney stone removal. The shock wave lithotripter uses an order of microsecond pulse durations and up to a 100 MPa pressure spike triggered at approximately 0.5-2 Hz to fragment kidney stones through mechanical mechanisms. One important mechanism is cavitation. We proposed an alternative type of lithotripsy method that maximizes cavitation activity to disintegrate kidney stones using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Here we outline the method according to the previously published literature (Matsumoto et al., Dynamics of bubble cloud in focused ultrasound. Proceedings of the second international symposium on therapeutic ultrasound, pp 290-299, 2002; Ikeda et al., Ultrasound Med Biol 32:1383-1397, 2006; Yoshizawa et al., Med Biol Eng Comput 47:851-860, 2009; Koizumi et al., A control framework for the non-invasive ultrasound the ragnostic system. Proceedings of 2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robotics and Systems (IROS), pp 4511-4516, 2009; Koizumi et al., IEEE Trans Robot 25:522-538, 2009). Cavitation activity is highly unpredictable; thus, a precise control system is needed. The proposed method comprises three steps of control in kidney stone treatment. The first step is control of localized high pressure fluctuation on the stone. The second step is monitoring of cavitation activity and giving feedback on the optimized ultrasound conditions. The third step is stone tracking and precise ultrasound focusing on the stone. For the high pressure control we designed a two-frequency wave (cavitation control (C-C) waveform); a high frequency ultrasound pulse (1-4 MHz) to create a cavitation cloud, and a low frequency trailing pulse (0.5 MHz) following the high frequency pulse to force the cloud into collapse. High speed photography showed cavitation collapse on a kidney stone and shock wave emission from the cloud. We also conducted in-vitro erosion tests of model and natural kidney stones. For the model stones, the erosion rate of the C-C waveform showed a distinct advantage with the combined high and low frequency waves over either wave alone. For optimization of the high frequency ultrasound intensity, we investigated the relationship between subharmonic emission from cavitation bubbles and stone erosion volume. For stone tracking we have also developed a non-invasive ultrasound theragnostic system (NIUTS) that compensates for kidney motion. Natural stones were eroded and most of the resulting fragments were less than 1 mm in diameter. The small fragments were small enough to pass through the urethra. The results demonstrate that, with the precise control of cavitation activity, focused ultrasound has the potential to be used to develop a less invasive and more controllable lithotripsy system.",1
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is emerging as an effective and promising treatment modality for the formation of coagulative necrosis inside the cancer/tumor noninvasively. To guarantee the efficacy and efficiency of HIFU ablation, the temperature field and consequent thermal dose should be monitored accurately in a high temporal and spatial resolution in real time. However, because of the significant variations of the tissue properties and deep penetration of HIFU beam, especially in the abdominal application, noninvasive thermometry is a very challenging topic, which may hamper the wide acceptance of HIFU by physicians worldwide. In this article, currently available thermometry techniques are reviewed, and their translation from hyperthermia range to the higher temperature for irreversible lesion production is discussed. With the technology improvement and/or development of new approaches, the performance of noninvasive thermometry may meet the clinical requirements.",1
"The tremendous progress in engineering and computing power coupled with ultrasound transducer technology and imaging modalities over the past 20 years have encouraged a revival of clinical interest in ultrasound therapy, mainly in High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). So far, the most extensive results from HIFU obtained in urology involve transrectal prostate ablation, which appears to be an effective therapeutic alternative for patients with malignant prostate tumors. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men. Several treatment options with different therapeutic approaches exist, including HIFU for localized PCa that has been in use for over 15 years. Since the early 2000s, two systems have been marketed for this application, and other devices are currently in clinical trials. HIFU treatment can be used either alone or in combination with (before- or after-) external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (before or after HIFU) and can be repeated multiple times. HIFU treatment is performed under real-time monitoring with ultrasound or guided by MRI. Two indications are validated today: Primary care treatment and EBRT failure. The results of HIFU for primary care treatment are similar to standard conformal EBRT, even though no randomized comparative studies have been performed and no 10-year follow up data is yet available for HIFU. Salvage HIFU after EBRT failure is increasing with oncological outcomes, similar to those achieved with surgery but with the advantage of fewer adverse effects. HIFU is an evolving technology perfectly adapted for focal treatment. Thus, HIFU focal therapy is another pathway that must be explored when considering the accuracy and reliability for PCa mapping techniques. HIFU would be particularly suited for such a therapy since it is clear that HIFU outcomes and toxicity are relative to the volume of prostate treated.",1
"To make full use of the ability of magnetic resonance (MR) to guide high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment, effort has been made to improve techniques for thermometry, motion tracking, and sound beam visualization. For monitoring rapid temperature elevation with proton resonance frequency (PRF) shift, data acquisition and processing can be accelerated with parallel imaging and/or sparse sampling in conjunction with appropriate signal processing methods. Thermometry should be robust against tissue motion, motion-induced magnetic field variation, and susceptibility change. Thus, multibaseline, referenceless, or hybrid techniques have become important. In cases with adipose or bony tissues, for which PRF shift cannot be used, thermometry with relaxation times or signal intensity may be utilized. Motion tracking is crucial not only for thermometry but also for targeting the focus of an ultrasound in moving organs such as the liver, kidney, or heart. Various techniques for motion tracking, such as those based on an anatomical image atlas with optical-flow displacement detection, a navigator echo to seize the diaphragm position, and/or rapid imaging to track vessel positions, have been proposed. Techniques for avoiding the ribcage and near-field heating have also been examined. MR acoustic radiation force imaging (MR-ARFI) is an alternative to thermometry that can identify the location and shape of the focal spot and sound beam path. This technique could be useful for treating heterogeneous tissue regions or performing transcranial therapy. All of these developments, which will be discussed further in this review, expand the applicability of HIFU treatments to a variety of clinical targets while maintaining safety and precision.",1
"Various kinds of image-guided techniques have been successfully applied in the last years for the treatment of tumours, as alternative to surgical resection. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a novel, totally non-invasive, image-guided technique that allows for achieving tissue destruction with the application of focused ultrasound at high intensity. This technique has been successfully applied for the treatment of a large variety of diseases, including oncological and non-oncological diseases. One of the most fascinating aspects of image-guided ablations, and particularly of HIFU, is the reported possibility of determining a sort of stimulation of the immune system, with an unexpected ""systemic"" response to treatments designed to be ""local"". In the present article the mechanisms of action of HIFU are described, and the main clinical applications of this technique are reported, with a particular focus on the immune-stimulation process that might originate from tumour ablations.",1
"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is rapidly gaining clinical acceptance as a technique capable of providing non-invasive heating and ablation for a wide range of applications. Usually requiring only a single session, treatments are often conducted as day case procedures, with the patient either fully conscious, lightly sedated or under light general anesthesia. HIFU scores over other thermal ablation techniques because of the lack of necessity for the transcutaneous insertion of probes into the target tissue. Sources placed either outside the body (for treatment of tumors or abnormalities of the liver, kidney, breast, uterus, pancreas brain and bone), or in the rectum (for treatment of the prostate), provide rapid heating of a target tissue volume, the highly focused nature of the field leaving tissue in the ultrasound propagation path relatively unaffected. Numerous extra-corporeal, transrectal and interstitial devices have been designed to optimize application-specific treatment delivery for the wide-ranging areas of application that are now being explored with HIFU. Their principle of operation is described here, and an overview of their design principles is given.",1
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally invasive therapy applied for prostate cancer that capitalizes on the coagulation necrosis that occurs at temperatures greater than 60°C. Owing to a lack of long-term follow-up data the procedure is still considered experimental treatment. As primary therapy, HIFU is indicated in patients aged ≥70 years with clinical organ-confined disease, although it has also been used, with encouraging results, as first line salvage therapy after definitive treatment, and in locally advanced (T3-4) and non-metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Morbidity associated with this treatment method appears to be low and includes urinary retention (1-9%), urethral stricture (4-14%), incontinence (1-15%), erectile dysfunction (13-53%) and rectourethral fistulae (0-3%). The risk of complications increases with repeated treatments. A few studies have recently been published on HIFU as focal therapy. HIFU technology can be enhanced using means such as ultrasound microbubble contrast agents for assessment of therapy efficacy, magnetic resonance imaging to guide the enhancement of heat rate, and localized drug and gene delivery.",1
