"OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative safety and effectiveness of two prostate cancer treatment ablation modalities-irreversible electroporation (IRE) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).  METHODS: Two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) on IRE and HIFU were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted in PubMed and EMBASE. Independent reviewers assessed literature eligibility and abstracted safety and effectiveness data. Oncological, safety, functional, and quality of life (QOL) outcomes were examined for each technology. MAs were conducted where data quality and availability allowed, using normal methods and a random/mixed effects model, and quality assessments performed. RESULTS: Fifty-five publications (n=22 IRE; n=33 HIFU) were included in the SLRs, and MAs were conducted on negative in-field post-procedure biopsy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level reduction, potency, urinary continence, and AE rate outcomes. MAs revealed that IRE patients had lower mean percent PSA level reductions, higher mean rates of in-field negative post-treatment biopsy, and higher rates of potency maintenance than HIFU patients. Most adverse events (AEs) reported were comparable and minor (Grades I, II), with urinary tract infection, dysuria, hematuria, and incontinence or urgency most frequently reported. The proportion of patients experiencing a severe AE (≥Grade III) ranged from 0 to 8% after IRE and HIFU. Both modalities were associated with positive functional outcomes as well as maintenance of QOL after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both IRE and HIFU were found to produce favorable effectiveness outcomes and have low complication rates while minimally impacting patient urinary and erectile function and maintaining overall QOL. These real-world findings can help guide clinical decision making and improve disease management for patients with prostate cancer.",0
"With an ever-growing list of neurological applications of focused ultrasound (FUS), there has been a consequent increase in the variety of systems for delivering ultrasound energy to the brain. Specifically, recent successful pilot clinical trials of blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening with FUS have generated substantial interest in the future applications of this relatively novel therapy, with divergent, purpose-built technologies emerging. With many of these technologies at various stages of pre-clinical and clinical investigation, this article seeks to provide an overview and analysis of the numerous medical devices in active use and under development for FUS-mediated BBB opening.",0
"We report a patient with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease who had a mild cavitation bioeffect during magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy. During the aligning phase with low-energy sonication, cavitation caused mild dysarthria and paresthesia, prompting treatment cessation. At the same time, tremor and rigidity improved. MRI revealed extensive high-intensity lesions in the thalamus 1 day after the procedure followed by steroid infusion, which resulted in resolution of adverse events. Tremor and rigidity improved 1.5 years after the procedure. Although cavitation can relieve tremors and rigidity, it should be carefully monitored due to potential permanent adverse events by unpredictable and unknown behaviors.",0
"BACKGROUND: Herein, a robotic system offering Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) therapy of thyroid nodules was developed. METHODS: The robotic system offers linear motion in 2 PC-controlled axes that navigate a 3 MHz single-element focused transducer. The system, through a C-arm structure attaches to the table of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners and couples to the neck of patients lying in the supine position. The MRI compatibility of the developed system was assessed inside a 3 T scanner. Benchtop and MRI feasibility studies evaluating the heating performance of the system were executed on excised pork tissue and on homogeneous and thyroid model agar-based phantoms. RESULTS: The MRI compatibility of the system was successfully established. Grid sonications executed using robotic motion inflicted discrete and overlapping lesions on the excised tissue, while magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry successfully monitored thermal heating in agar-based phantoms. CONCLUSIONS: The developed system was found to be efficient with ex-vivo evaluation. The system can perform clinical MRgFUS therapy of thyroid nodules and other shallow targets after further in-vivo evaluation.",0
"BACKGROUND: Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a medical technology that non-invasively stimulates the brain and has been applied in thermal ablation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, and neuromodulation. In recent years, numerous experiences and indications for the use of FUS in clinical and preclinical studies have rapidly expanded. Focused ultrasound-mediated BBB opening induces cognitive enhancement and neurogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. METHODS: Here, we investigate the effects of FUS-mediated BBB opening on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive function in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We applied FUS with microbubble to the hippocampus and LTP was measured 6 weeks after BBB opening using FUS. Field recordings were made with a concentric bipolar electrode positioned in the CA1 region using an extracellular glass pipette filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Morris water maze and Y-maze was performed to test cognitive function. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that FUS-mediated BBB opening has a significant impact on increasing LTP at Schaffer collateral - CA1 synapses and rescues cognitive dysfunction and working memory. These effects persisted for up to 7 weeks post-treatment. Also, FUS-mediated BBB opening in the hippocampus increased PKA phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Therefore, it could be a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases as it remarkably increases LTP, thereby improving working memory.",0
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common digestive malignancies. HCC It ranges as the fifth most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide. While The prognosis of metastatic or advanced HCC is still quite poor. Recently, locoregional treatment, especially local ablation therapies, plays an important role in the treatment of HCC. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation are the most common-used methods effective and feasible for treating HCC. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of ablation in the treatments for HCC and the HCC recurrence after ablation still are poorly understood. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), the key gene switch for adaptive responses to hypoxia, has been found to play an essential role in the rapid aggressive recurrence of HCC after ablation treatment. In this review, we summarized the current evidence of the roles of HIF in the treatment of HCC with ablation. Fifteen relevant studies were included and further analyzed. Among them, three clinical studies suggested that HIF-1α might serve as a crucial role in the RAF treatment of HCC or the local recurrence of HCC after RFA. The remainder included experimental studies demonstrated that HIF-1, 2α might target the different molecules (e.g., BNIP3, CA-IX, and arginase-1) and signaling cascades (e.g., VEGFA/EphA2 pathway), constituting a complex network that promoted HCC invasion and metastasis after ablation. Currently, the inhibitors of HIF have been developed, providing important proof of targeting HIF for the prevention of HCC recurrence after IRFA and HIFU ablation. Further confirmation by prospective clinical and in-depth experimental studies is still warranted to illustrate the effects of HIF in HCC recurrence followed ablation treatment in the future.",0
"INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) represents an incisionless treatment option for essential or parkinsonian tremor. The incisionless nature of this procedure has garnered interest from both patients and providers. As such, an increasing number of centers are initiating new MRgFUS programs, necessitating development of unique workflows to optimize patient care and safety. Herein, we describe establishment of a multi-disciplinary team, workflow processes, and outcomes for a new MRgFUS program. METHODS: This is a single-academic center retrospective review of 116 consecutive patients treated for hand tremor between 2020 and 2022. MRgFUS team members, treatment workflow, and treatment logistics were reviewed and categorized. Tremor severity and adverse events were evaluated at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-MRgFUS with the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor Part B (CRST-B). Trends in outcome and treatment parameters over time were assessed. Workflow and technical modifications were noted. RESULTS: The procedure, workflow, and team members remained consistent throughout all treatments. Technique modifications were attempted to reduce adverse events. A significant reduction in CRST-B score was achieved at 3 months (84.5%), 6 months (79.8%), and 12 months (72.2%) post-procedure (p < 0.0001). The most common post-procedure adverse events in the acute period (<1 day) were gait imbalance (61.1%), fatigue and/or lethargy (25.0%), dysarthria (23.2%), headache (20.4%), and lip/hand paresthesia (13.9%). By 12 months, the majority of adverse events had resolved with a residual 17.8% reporting gait imbalance, 2.2% dysarthria, and 8.9% lip/hand paresthesia. No significant trends in treatment parameters were found. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the feasibility of establishing an MRgFUS program with a relatively rapid increase in evaluation and treatment of patients while maintaining high standards of safety and quality. While efficacious and durable, adverse events occur and can be permanent in MRgFUS.",0
"PURPOSE: In high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment of the kidney and liver, tracking the organs is essential because respiratory motions make continuous cauterization of the affected area difficult and may cause damage to other parts of the body. In this study, we propose a tracking system for rotational scanning, and propose and evaluate a method for estimating the angles of organs in ultrasound images. METHODS: We proposed AEMA, AEMAD, and AEMAD++ as methods for estimating the angles of organs in ultrasound images, using RUDS and a phantom to acquire 90-degree images of a kidney from the long-axis image to the short-axis image as a data set. Six datasets were used, with five for preliminary preparation and one for testing, while the initial position was shifted by 2 mm in the contralateral axis direction. The test data set was evaluated by estimating the angle using each method. RESULTS: The accuracy and processing speed of angle estimation for AEMA, AEMAD, and AEMAD++ were 23.8% and 0.33 FPS for AEMAD, 32.0% and 0.56 FPS for AEMAD, and 29.5% and 3.20 FPS for AEMAD++, with tolerance of ± 2.5 degrees. AEMAD++ offered the best speed and accuracy. CONCLUSION: In the phantom experiment, AEMAD++ showed the effectiveness of tracking the long-axis image of the kidney in rotational scanning. In the future, we will add either the area of surrounding organs or the internal structure of the kidney as a new feature to validate the results.",0
"Luminol is a classic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) luminophore. The luminol-O2 ECL system suffers from a problem, that is, the conversion rate of dissolved O2 into reactive oxygen species (ROS) is low. In this work, we used high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) pretreatment combined with Ti3C2-TiO2 to construct a highly sensitive luminol-O2 ECL system for the specific detection of polynucleotide kinase (PNK) first. On the one hand, HIFU generated ROS in situ as a coreactant via the cavitation effect to boost the luminol emission. On the other hand, Ti3C2-TiO2 was prepared in situ via Ti3C2 as a reducing agent, and it can aggregate and catalyze ROS generated in situ by HIFU. Moreover, the Ti on the Ti3C2-TiO2 surface could bind to phosphate groups through chelation, thereby realizing highly specific detection of PNK. The sensor has a linear relationship range of 1.0 × 10-5 to 10.0 U mL-1, and the limit of detection is 1.48 × 10-7 U mL-1, which is superior to most existing methods. The sensor performance in HeLa cell lysate was measured with a satisfactory result. The designed ECL biosensor has potential applications in biological analysis and clinical diagnosis.",0
"TiO2 is the most commonly used photocatalyst in water treatment. The particle size of TiO2 is an important factor that significantly influences its activity during photocatalytic degradation. In the presence of liquid, the properties of nanopowders composed of exactly the same product clearly differ according to their aggregation size. In this study, TiO2 nanoparticles with a controlled size were fabricated by focused ultrasound dispersion. The high energy generated by this system was used to control the size of TiO2 particles in the suspension. The constant high energy released by cavitation enabled the dispersion of the particles without a surfactant. The activities of the prepared TiO2 photocatalysts for methylene blue (MB) degradation were then compared. The dye degradation effect of the photocatalyst was as high as 61.7% after 10 min when the size of the powder was controlled in the solution, but it was only as high as 41.0% when the aggregation size was not controlled. Furthermore, when the TiO2 concentration exceeded a certain level, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 decreased. Controlling the size of the aggregated photocatalyst particles is, therefore, essential in water-treatment technologies utilizing TiO2 photocatalytic properties, and adjusting the TiO2 concentration is an important economic factor in this photocatalytic technology. This study contributes to the development of processes for degrading dyes, such as MB, released from wastewater into aquatic environments.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Precise control over the ultrasound field parameters experienced by biological samples during sonication experiments in vitro may be quite challenging. The main goal of this work was to outline an approach to construction of sonication test cells that would minimize the interaction between the test cells and ultrasound. METHODS: Optimal dimensions of the test cell were determined through measurements conducted in a water sonication tank using 3D-printed test objects. The offset of local acoustic intensity variability inside the sonication test cell was set to value of ±50% of the reference value (i.e., local acoustic intensity measured at last axial maximum in the free-field condition). The cytotoxicity of several materials used for 3D printing was determined using the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. RESULTS: The sonication test cells were 3D printed from polylactic acid material, which was not toxic to the cells. Silicone membrane HT-6240, which was used to construct the bottom of the test cell, was found to reduce ultrasound energy minimally. Final ultrasound profiles inside the sonication test cells indicated the desired variability of local acoustic intensity. The cell viability in our sonication test cell was comparable to that of commercial culture plates with bottoms constructed with silicone membrane. CONCLUSION: An approach to construction of sonication test cells minimizing the interaction of the test cell and ultrasound has been outlined.",0
"Focused ultrasound is a novel technique for the treatment of aggressive brain tumors that uses both mechanical and thermal mechanisms. This non-invasive technique can allow for both the thermal ablation of inoperable tumors and the delivery of chemotherapy and immunotherapy while minimizing the risk of infection and shortening the time to recovery. With recent advances, focused ultrasound has been increasingly effective for larger tumors without the need for a craniotomy and can be used with minimal surrounding soft tissue damage. Treatment efficacy is dependent on multiple variables, including blood-brain barrier permeability, patient anatomical features, and tumor-specific features. Currently, many clinical trials are currently underway for the treatment of non-neoplastic cranial pathologies and other non-cranial malignancies. In this article, we review the current state of surgical management of brain tumors using focused ultrasound.",0
"Optogenetics has revolutionized neuroscience understanding by allowing spatiotemporal control over cell-type specific neurons in neural circuits. However, the sluggish development of noninvasive photon delivery in the brain has limited the clinical application of optogenetics. Focused ultrasound (FUS)-derived mechanoluminescence has emerged as a promising tool for in situ photon emission, but there is not yet a biocompatible liquid-phase mechanoluminescence system for spatiotemporal optogenetics. To achieve noninvasive optogenetics with a high temporal resolution and desirable biocompatibility, we have developed liposome (Lipo@IR780/L012) nanoparticles for FUS-triggered mechanoluminescence in brain photon delivery. Synchronized and stable blue light emission was generated in solution under FUS irradiation due to the cascade reactions in liposomes. In vitro tests revealed that Lipo@IR780/L012 could be triggered by FUS for light emission at different stimulation frequencies, resulting in activation of opsin-expressing spiking HEK cells under the FUS irradiation. In vivo optogenetic stimulation further demonstrated that motor cortex neurons could be noninvasively and reversibly activated under the repetitive FUS irradiation after intravenous injection of lipid nanoparticles to achieve limb movements.",0
"The efficacy of many anti-epileptic drugs, including phenytoin (PHT), is reduced by plasma protein binding (PPB) that sequesters therapeutically active drug molecules within the bloodstream. An increase in systemic dose elevates the risk of drug side effects, which demands an alternative technique to increase the unbound concentration of PHT in a region-specific manner. We present a low-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) technique that locally enhances the efficacy of PHT by transiently disrupting its binding to albumin. We first identified the acoustic parameters that yielded the highest PHT unbinding from albumin among evaluated parameter sets using equilibrium dialysis. Then, rats with chronic mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) received four sessions of PHT injection, each followed by 30 min of FUS delivered to the ictal region, across 2 weeks. Two additional groups of mTLE rats underwent the same procedure, but without receiving PHT or FUS. Assessment of electrographic seizure activities revealed that FUS accompanying administration of PHT effectively reduced the number and mean duration of ictal events compared to other conditions, without damaging brain tissue or the blood-brain barrier. Our results demonstrated that the FUS technique enhanced the anti-epileptic efficacy of PHT in a chronic mTLE rodent model by region-specific PPB disruption.",0
"BACKGROUND: Liposuction, the most common body sculpting surgical procedure known today is associated with the risk of numerous complications. A safer and more noninvasive approach involves the use of high-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU) lasers, which work by selectively damaging fat tissue through apoptosis or necrosis induction of fat cells. The authors' systematic review was designed to identify the effectiveness of HIFU for nonsurgical facial and body contouring. METHODS: An exhaustive literature search was conducted of the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Scopus, and EBSCO electronic databases for the period from November of 2005 to July of 2020. The full text of selected articles was reviewed for possible study inclusion, and articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria were recruited. Characteristics of the included studies were noted, and outcomes were assessed. Assessment of quality and risk of bias was performed for all the studies using the RevMan tool and the methodological index for nonrandomized studies. RESULTS: The initial search revealed a total of 4584 citations, of which only 11 were included in the present review: nine used HIFU for recontouring of the abdomen and only two used HIFU over the face and neck. Studies evaluated either the efficacy of HIFU or the safety of its use. The average total energy ranged from 140 to 248 J/cm 2 for the abdominal region and 0.3 to 1.2 J/cm 2 for the face and neck. The focal depth ranged from 1.1 to 1.8 cm. All the studies showed promising results with the use of HIFU. CONCLUSION: HIFU therapy is safe, effective, and minimally invasive, with predictable results when used for body and facial recontouring.",0
"Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) lesioning of the ventralis intermedius nucleus (VIM) has shown promise in treating drug-refractory essential tremor (ET). It remains unknown whether focal VIM lesions by MRgFUS have broader restorative effects on information flow within the whole-brain network of ET patients. We applied an information-theoretical approach based on intrinsic ignition and the concept of transfer entropy (TE) to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics after VIM-MRgFUS. Eighteen ET patients (mean age 71.44 years) underwent repeated 3T resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) assessments one day before (T0) and one month (T1) and six months (T2) post-MRgFUS, respectively. We observed increased whole brain ignition-driven mean integration (IDMI) at T1 (p < 0.05), along with trend increases at T2. Further, constraining to motor network nodes, we identified significant increases in information-broadcasting (bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) and left cerebellar lobule III) and information-receiving (right precentral gyrus) at T1. Remarkably, increased information-broadcasting in bilateral SMA was correlated with relative improvement of the CRST in the treated hand. In addition, causal TE-based effective connectivity (EC) at T1 showed an increase from right SMA to left cerebellar lobule crus II and from left cerebellar lobule III to right thalamus. In conclusion, results suggest a change in information transmission capacity in ET after MRgFUS and a shift towards a more integrated functional state with increased levels of global and directional information flow.",0
"An accurate method for neural stimulation within the brain could be very useful for treating brain circuit dysfunctions and neurological disorders. With the aim of developing such a method, this study investigated the use of piezoelectric molybdenum disulfide nanosheets (MoS2 NS) to remotely convert ultrasound energy into localized electrical stimulation in vitro and in vivo. The application of ultrasound to cells surrounding MoS2 NS required only a single pulse of 2 MHz ultrasound (400 kPa, 1,000,000 cycles, and 500 ms pulse duration) to elicit significant responses in 37.9 ± 7.4% of cells in terms of fluxes of calcium ions without detectable cellular damage. The proportion of responsive cells was mainly influenced by the acoustic pressure, number of ultrasound cycles, and concentration of MoS2 NS. Tests using appropriate blockers revealed that voltage-gated membrane channels were activated. In vivo data suggested that, with ultrasound stimulation, neurons closest to the MoS2 NS were 3-fold more likely to present c-Fos expression than cells far from the NS. The successful activation of neurons surrounding MoS2 NS suggests that this represents a method with high spatial precision for selectively modulating one or several targeted brain circuits.",0
"Focused ultrasound stimulation (FUS) activates mechanosensitive ion channels and is emerging as a method of noninvasive neuromodulation. In preclinical studies, FUS of the spleen (sFUS) activates an anti-inflammatory neural pathway which suppresses acute and chronic inflammation. However, the relevance of sFUS for regulating inflammatory responses in humans is unknown. Here, we used a modified diagnostic ultrasound imaging system to target the spleen of healthy human subjects with 3 min of continuously swept or stationary focused pulsed ultrasound, delivered at three different energy levels within allowable safety exposure limits. Potential anti-inflammatory effects of sFUS were assessed by measuring sFUS-elicited changes in endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in whole blood samples from insonified subjects. We found that stimulation with either continuously swept or focused pulsed ultrasound has an anti-inflammatory effect: sFUS lowers TNF production for >2 h, with TNF returning to baseline by 24 h following sFUS. This response is independent of anatomical target (i.e., spleen hilum or parenchyma) or ultrasound energy level. No clinical, biochemical, or hematological parameters are adversely impacted. This is the first demonstration that sFUS suppresses the normal inflammatory response in humans, with potential implications for noninvasive bioelectronic therapy of inflammatory disorders.",0
"BACKGROUND: Locally recurrent prostate cancer following primary external beam radiotherapy without distant metastasis is a challenging problem, with no current consensus on the optimal management of these patients. Traditional whole-gland salvage treatments offered up to a 50% 5-year disease-free survival rate but with troubling levels of risk for significant complications. Recent progress in advanced imaging techniques has allowed a more accurate selection of patients with local-only recurrence and a selection of patients that may be suitable for newer partial-gland salvage treatments that may reduce late complications. METHODS: This article reviews advances in patient selection and provides an overview of whole- and partial-gland salvage results from selected recent meta-analyses, multi-institutional series, and studies from centers of excellence for these treatment approaches. RESULTS: Salvage radical prostatectomy produces 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates in the 50%-60% range with severe gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in < 2% but severe genitourinary (GU) toxicity in 15%-23% of patients. The whole-gland options of high and low dose rate brachytherapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy appear to offer similar 5-year control rates, with low severe GU and GI toxicity rates of 4%-8% and <2%, respectively. Cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) offer similar 5-year RFS rates but carry significant risks for severe GU and GI toxicity in the range of 10%-27% and <2%, respectively. Early results of partial-gland salvage techniques in selected patients appear promising, with 3-year RFS rates of 48%-72% and rare grade 3 toxicity. CONCLUSION: It is important to understand the relative effectiveness and risks of the various treatment options to effectively counsel patients who face this distressing clinical situation. Whole-gland salvage options offer the possibility of long-term control but with significant risks of severe toxicity. Emerging data for the partial-gland salvage options in appropriately selected patients may offer hope of reasonable control rates with reduced severe toxicity.",0
"Our aim is to summarize the new European Resuscitation Council (ERC) 2021 guidelines on paediatric life support. In children, exhaustion of compensatory mechanisms in respiratory or circulatory failure leads to cardiac arrest. Recognition and treatment of children in critical condition are the most important element of its prevention. With the ABCDE approach, life-threatening problems can be identified and treated using simple interventions (bag-mask ventilation, intraosseous access, fluid bolus, etc.). Important new recommendations: 4-hand ventilation during bag-mask ventilation, target saturation of 94-98% during oxygen therapy, and fluid bolus of 10 ml/kg. In pediatric basic life support, if there is no normal breathing after 5 initial rescue breaths in absence of signs of life, chest compression should be initiated immediately using primarily two-thumb encircling method for infants. Recommended rate is 100-120/min, ratio of compression to ventilation is 15 : 2. Pediatric advanced life support is a teamwork. The structure of the algorithm is unchanged, high-quality chest compression is still a paramount. Recognition and treatment of potential reversible causes (4H-4T) and the decisive role of focused ultrasound are emphasized. New features: recommendation of 4-hand technique bag-mask ventilation, role of capnography, and age-dependent ventilatory rate in the case of continuous chest compression after endotracheal intubation. Drug therapy is unchanged, the fastest way to administer adrenaline during resuscitation is via intraosseous access. Treatment after return of spontaneous circulation decisively influences neurological outcome. Patient care is further based on the ABCDE scheme. Important goals are maintaining normoxia, normocapnia, avoiding hypotension, hypoglycemia, fever and use of targeted temperature management. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(12): 463-473.",0
"PRCIS: Ultrasound cyclo plasty (UCP) using high-intensity focused ultrasound is an effective and safe procedure in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma, even in those with high myopia. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UCP in glaucoma patients with high myopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we enrolled 36 eyes divided into 2 groups based on axial length: group A (≥26.00 mm) and group B (<26.00 mm). We collected data about visual acuity, Goldmann applanation tonometry, biomicroscopy, and visual field before the procedure and at 1, 7, 30, 60, 90, 180, and 365 days after the procedure. RESULTS: Mean IOP significantly decreased in both groups after treatment ( P <0.001). Mean IOP reduction from baseline to the last visit was 9.8±6.6 mmHg (38.7%) in group A and 9.6±6.3 mmHg (34.8%) in group B ( P <0.001). Mean IOP at the last visit was 15.8±4.1 mmHg in the myopic group and 18.1±5.6 mmHg in the non-myopic one. Regarding the number of IOP-lowering eyedrops being taken by our patients, statistically significant differences were found between groups A and B neither at baseline (2.8±0.9 and 2.6±1.0; P =0.568) nor 1 year after the procedure (2.5±1.1 and 2.6±1.1; P =0.762). No major complications occurred. All minor adverse events resolved within a few days. CONCLUSION: UCP seems to be an effective and well-tolerated strategy to lower IOP in glaucoma patients with high myopia.",0
"Minimally invasive ablation has been widely applied for treatment of various solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast carcinomas, etc. In addition to removing the primary tumor lesion, ablative techniques are also capable of improving the anti-tumor immune response by inducing immunogenic tumor cell death and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, which may be of great benefit to inhibit the recurrent metastasis of residual tumor. However, the short-acting activated anti-tumor immunity of post-ablation will rapidly reverse into an immunosuppressive state, and the recurrent metastasis owing to incomplete ablation is closely associated with a dismal prognosis for the patients. In recent years, numerous nanoplatforms have been developed to improve the local ablative effect through enhancing the targeting delivery and combining it with chemotherapy. Particularly, amplifying the anti-tumor immune stimulus signal, modulating the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and improving the anti-tumor immune response with the versatile nanoplatforms have heralded great application prospects for improving the local control and preventing tumor recurrence and distant metastasis. This review discusses recent advances in nanoplatform-potentiated ablation-immune synergistic tumor therapy, focusing on common ablation techniques including radiofrequency, microwave, laser, and high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation, cryoablation, and magnetic hyperthermia ablation, etc. We discuss the advantages and challenges of the corresponding therapies and propose possible directions for future research, which is expected to provide references for improving the traditional ablation efficacy.",0
"Novel treatment options for uterine fibroids, such as uterine artery embolization (UAE), ultrasound-guided and magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU and MRgHIFU), and transcervical radiofrequency ablation (TFA) methods, are widely used in clinical practice. This systematic review and meta-analysis (CRD42022297312) aims to assess and compare reproductive and obstetric outcomes in women who underwent these minimally invasive approaches for uterine fibroids. The search was performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Cochrane guidelines. The articles were selected to meet the following eligibility criteria: (1) research article, (2) human subject research, and (3) the study of pregnancy outcomes after the treatment of uterine fibroids by either one of three methods-UAE, HIFU, and TFA. The analysis of 25 eligible original articles shows a similar rate of live births for UAE, USgHIFU, MRgHIFU, and TFA (70.8%, 73.5%, 70%, and 75%, respectively). The number of pregnancies varied considerably among these studies, as well as the mean age of pregnant women. However, the results of pregnancy outcomes for TFA are insufficient to draw firm conclusions, since only 24 women became pregnant in these studies, resulting in three live births. The miscarriage rate was highest in the UAE group (19.2%). USgHIFU was associated with a higher rate of placental abnormalities compared to UAE (2.8% vs. 1.6%). The pooled estimate of pregnancies was 17.31% to 44.52% after UAE, 18.69% to 78.53% after HIFU, and 2.09% to 7.63% after TFA. The available evidence confirmed that these minimally invasive uterine-sparing treatment options for uterine fibroids are a good approach for patients wishing to preserve their fertility, with comparable reproductive and obstetric outcomes among the different techniques.",0
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a sophisticated structure whose full functionality is required for maintaining the executive functions of the central nervous system (CNS). Tight control of transport across the barrier means that most drugs, particularly large size, which includes powerful biologicals, cannot reach their targets in the brain. Notwithstanding the remarkable advances in characterizing the cellular nature of the BBB and consequences of BBB dysfunction in pathology (brain metastasis, neurological diseases), it remains challenging to deliver drugs to the CNS. Herein, we outline the basic architecture and key molecular constituents of the BBB. In addition, we review the current status of approaches that are being explored to temporarily open the BBB in order to allow accumulation of therapeutics in the CNS. Undoubtedly, the major concern in field is whether it is possible to open the BBB in a meaningful way without causing negative consequences. In this context, we have also listed few other important key considerations that can improve our understanding about the dynamics of the BBB.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an obstacle for molecules to pass through from blood to the brain. Focused ultrasound is a new method which temporarily opens the BBB, which makes pharmaceutical delivery or removal of neurodegenerative proteins possible. This study was demonstrated to review our BBB opening procedure with magnetic resonance guided images and find specific patterns in the BBB opening. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed the procedures and results of two clinical studies on BBB opening using focused ultrasound regarding its safety and clinical efficacy. Magnetic resonance images were also reviewed to discover any specific findings. RESULTS: Two clinical trials showed clinical benefits. All clinical trials demonstrated safe BBB opening, with no specific side effects. Magnetic resonance imaging showed temporary T1 contrast enhancement in the sonication area, verifying the BBB opening. Several low-signal intensity spots were observed in the T2 susceptibility-weighted angiography images, which were also reversible and temporary. Although these spots can be considered as microbleeding, evidence suggests these are not ordinary microbleeding but an indicator for adequate BBB opening. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance images proved safe and efficient BBB opening in humans, using focused ultrasound.",0
"Emerging holographic haptic interfaces focus ultrasound in air to enable their users to touch, feel, and manipulate three-dimensional virtual objects. However, current holographic haptic systems furnish tactile sensations that are diffuse and faint, with apparent spatial resolutions that are far coarser than would be theoretically predicted from acoustic focusing. Here, we show how the effective spatial resolution and dynamic range of holographic haptic displays are determined by ultrasound-driven elastic wave transport in soft tissues. Using time-resolved optical imaging and numerical simulations, we show that ultrasound-based holographic displays excite shear shock wave patterns in the skin. The spatial dimensions of these wave patterns can exceed nominal focal dimensions by more than an order of magnitude. Analyses of data from behavioral and vibrometry experiments indicate that shock formation diminishes perceptual acuity. For holographic haptic displays to attain their potential, techniques for circumventing shock wave artifacts, or for exploiting these phenomena, are needed.",0
"Low-intensity ultrasound (LI-US) is a non-invasive stimulation technique that has emerged in recent years and has been shown to have positive effects on neuromodulation, fracture healing, inflammation improvement, and metabolic regulation. This study reports the conclusions of a bibliometric analysis of LI-US. Input data for the period between 1995 and 2022, including 7209 related articles in the field of LI-US, were collected from the core library of the Web of Science (WOS) database. Using these data, a set of bibliometric indicators was obtained to gain knowledge on different aspects: global production, research areas, and sources analysis, contributions of countries and institutions, author analysis, citation analysis, and keyword analysis. This study combined the data analysis capabilities provided by the WOS database, making use of two bibliometric software tools: R software and VOS viewer to achieve analysis and data exploration visualization, and predicted the further development trends of LI-US. It turns out that the United States and China are co-leaders while Zhang ZG is the most significant author in LI-US. In the future, the hot spots of LI-US will continue to focus on parameter research, mechanism discussion, safety regulations, and neuromodulation applications.",0
"Ultrasound has been proven to enhance the mass transfer process and impact the fabrication of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO). However, the different effects of ultrasound propagating in different media make the specific target and process of ultrasound in AAO remain unclear, and the effects of ultrasound on AAO reported in previous studies are contradictory. These uncertainties have greatly limited the application of ultrasonic-assisted anodization (UAA) in practice. In this study, the bubble desorption and mass transfer enhancement effects were decoupled based on an anodizing system with focused ultrasound, such that the dual effects of ultrasound on different targets were distinguished. The results showed that ultrasound has the dual effects on AAO fabrication. Specifically, ultrasound focused on the anode has a nanopore-expansion effect on AAO, leading to a 12.24 % improvement in fabrication efficiency. This was attributed to the promotion of interfacial ion migration through ultrasonic-induced high-frequency vibrational bubble desorption. However, AAO nanopores were observed to shrink when ultrasound was focused on the electrolyte, accompanied by a 25.85 % reduction in fabrication efficiency. The effects of ultrasound on mass transfer through jet cavitation appeared to be the reason for this phenomenon. This study resolved the paradoxical phenomena of UAA in previous studies and is expected to guide AAO application in electrochemistry and surface treatments.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The ability to predict final lesion characteristics during magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy for the treatment of essential tremor remains technically challenging, yet it is essential in order to avoid off-target ablation and to ensure adequate treatment. The authors sought to evaluate the technical feasibility and utility of intraprocedural diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the prediction of final lesion size and location. METHODS: Lesion diameter and distance from the midline were measured on both intraprocedural and immediate postprocedural diffusion and T2-weighted sequences. Bland-Altman analysis was utilized to determine differences in measurement between intraprocedural and immediate postprocedural images with both sequences. RESULTS: Lesion size increased on both the postprocedural diffusion and T2-weighted sequences, although the difference was smaller on the T2-weighted sequence. There was only a small difference in intraprocedural and postprocedural lesion distance from the midline on both the diffusion and T2-weighted sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Intraprocedural DWI is both feasible and useful with regard to predicting final lesion size and providing an early indication of lesion location. Further research should determine the value of intraprocedural DWI in predicting delayed clinical outcomes.",0
"The principle of targeting brain circuits has drawn increasing attention with the growth of brain stimulation treatments such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and focused ultrasound (FUS). Each of these techniques can effectively treat different neuropsychiatric disorders, but treating any given disorder depends on choosing the right treatment target. Here, we propose a three-phase framework for identifying and modulating these targets. There are multiple approaches to identifying a target, including correlative neuroimaging, retrospective optimization based on existing stimulation sites, and lesion localization. These techniques can then be optimized using personalized neuroimaging, physiological monitoring, and engagement of a specific brain state using pharmacological or psychological interventions. Finally, a specific stimulation modality or combination of modalities can be chosen after considering the advantages and tradeoffs of each. While there is preliminary literature to support different components of this framework, there are still many unanswered questions. This presents an opportunity for the future growth of research and clinical care in brain circuit therapeutics.",0
"Cystic adenomyosis is a rare type of uterine adenomyosis, mainly seen in young women, which is often characterized by severe dysmenorrhea. The quality of life and reproductive function of young women could be affected by misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. At present, there are no universal guidelines and consensus. We report two cases of patients with cystic adenomyosis in juveniles treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation. In the first case, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated a cystic mass of 2.0 cm × 3.1 cm × 2.4 cm in the uterus. After she underwent HIFU treatment, her pelvic MRI showed a mass of 1.1 × 2.4 cm in size, and her dysmenorrhea symptoms gradually disappeared. In the second case, a pelvic MRI indicated a 5.1 cm × 3.3 cm × 4.7 cm cystic mass in the uterus. After she underwent HIFU and combined four consecutive cycles of GnRH-a treatment, the lesion shrunk 1.2 cm ×1.4 cm × 1.6 cm, without dysmenorrhea. Simultaneously, the report reviewed 14 cases of juvenile cystic adenomyosis over the last ten years. HIFU or HIFU-combined drugs were safe and effective in treating juvenile cystic adenomyosis, but multicenter and prospective studies may be necessary to validate this in the future.",0
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer acoustic output can vary over time as a result of an inconsistent power supply, damage to the transducer or deterioration over time. Therefore, easy implementation of a daily quality assurance (DQA) method is of great importance for pre-clinical research and clinical applications. We present here a thermochromic material-based phantom validated by thermal simulations and found to provide repeatable visual power output assessments in fewer than 15 s that are accurate to within 10%. Whereas current available methods such as radiation force balance measurements provide an estimate of the total acoustic power, we explain here that the thermochromic phantom is sensitive to the shape of the acoustic field at focus by changing the aperture of a multi-element transducer with a fixed acoustic power. The proposed phantom allows the end user to visually assess the transducer's functionality without resorting to expensive, time-consuming hydrophone measurements or image analysis.",0
"The role of interventional radiology (IR) is expanding. With new techniques being developed and tested, this radiology subspecialty is taking a step forward in different clinical scenarios, especially in oncology. Musculoskeletal tumoral diseases would definitely benefit from a low-invasive approach that could reduce mortality and morbidity in particular. Thermal ablation through IR has already become important in the palliation and consolidation of bone metastases, oligometastatic disease, local recurrences, and treating specific benign tumors, with a more tailored approach, considering the characteristics of every patient. As image-guided ablation techniques lower their invasiveness and increase their efficacy while the collateral effects and complications decrease, they become more relevant and need to be considered in patient care pathways and clinical management, to improve outcomes. We present a literature review of the different percutaneous and non-invasive image-guided thermal ablation methods that are currently available and that could in the future become relevant to manage musculoskeletal oncologic diseases.",0
"Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a new surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous experience with radiofrequency lesionectomy and deep brain stimulation (DBS) has identified several candidate targets for MRgFUS intended to alleviate the motor symptoms of PD. The main advantage of MRgFUS is that it is incisionless. MRgFUS has certain limitations and is associated with adverse effects. The present study reviews the literature on conventional surgical interventions for PD, discusses recent studies on MRgFUS, and the comparison between DBS and MRgFUS for PD. The reviews aims to provide an essential reference for neurologists to select the appropriate treatments for patients with PD.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Unilateral magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound subthalamotomy (FUS-STN) has been shown to improve the cardinal motor features of Parkinson disease (PD). Whether this effect is sustained is not known. This study aims to report the long-term outcome of patients with PD treated with unilateral FUS-STN. METHODS: We conducted a prospective open-label study of patients with asymmetrical PD who underwent unilateral FUS-STN. All patients were evaluated up to 36 months after treatment. The primary outcome was the difference from baseline to 36 months after FUS-STN in the score of the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor part (III) for the treated hemibody in the off-medication state. The safety outcome included all adverse events occurring during follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the change in the MDS-UPDRS III score on-medication; subscores of rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and axial features; total MDS-UPDRS III; and the MDS-UPDRS part IV. Functional disability and quality of life were assessed using the MDS-UPDRS II and the PDQ39, respectively. Patient impression of change and satisfaction with the treatment were self-assessed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test with subsequent Bonferroni's correction was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with PD were evaluated at 36 months after treatment. The mean (±SD) age at baseline was 56.0 ± 10.1 years, with a mean disease duration of 6.8 ± 2.8 years. The MDS-UPDRS III score for the treated hemibody off-medication was improved by 52.3% from baseline to 3 years (score reduction from 19.0 ± 3.2 to 8.9 ± 3.3, 95% CI 8.7 to 11.6, p < 0.001), and all specific motor features were improved from baseline. No disabling or delayed adverse events were reported. The total MDS-UPDRS III off-medication score was 22.9% lower at 3 years than before treatment (36.8 ± 7.4 vs 27.4 ± 6.2, 95% CI 6.0 to 11.5, p < 0.001). The MDS-UPDRS II, IV, and PDQ39 scores and levodopa dose were equivalent to those at baseline. DISCUSSION: The benefit of unilateral FUS-STN on PD motor features is sustained in the long term. FUS-STN contributes to better clinical control over several years of evolution. NCT02912871/03454425. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence on the utility of focused ultrasound unilateral subthalamotomy in the treatment of people with Parkinson disease.",0
"The invasiveness of neuromodulation technologies that require surgical implantation (e.g., electrical and optical stimulation) may limit their clinical application. Thus, alternative technologies that offer similar benefits without surgery are of paramount importance in the field of neuromodulation. Low-intensity ultrasound is an emerging modality for neural stimulation as ultrasound can be focused in deep tissues with millimeter resolution. Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) has already been demonstrated in a wide range of animals and even humans at different sonication frequencies (mostly in the sub-MHz range due to the presence of the skull). This article first provides some fundamental knowledge in ultrasound, and then reviews various examples of successful tFUS experiments in animals and humans using different stimulation patterns, as well as available tFUS technologies for generating, focusing, and steering ultrasound beams in neural tissues. In particular, phased array technologies for the ultrasound stimulation application are discussed with an emphasis on the design, fabrication, and integration of ultrasound transducer arrays as well as the design and development of phased array electronics with beamformer and high-voltage driver circuitry. The challenges in tFUS, such as its underlying mechanism, indirect auditory response, and skull aberration effects, are also discussed.",0
"PURPOSE: To describe the national-level patterns of care for local ablative therapy among men with PCa and identify patient- and hospital-level factors associated with the receipt of these techniques. METHODS: We retrospectively interrogated the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for men with clinically localized PCa between 2010 and 2017. The main outcome was receipt of local tumor ablation with either cryo- or laser-ablation, and ""other method of local tumor destruction including high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)"". Patient level, hospital level, and demographic variables were collected. Mixed effect logistic regression models were fitted to identify separately patient- and hospital-level predictors of receipt of local ablative therapy. RESULTS: Overall, 11,278 patients received ablative therapy, of whom 78.8% had cryotherapy, 15.6% had laser, and 5.7% had another method including HIFU. At the patient level, men with intermediate-risk PCa were more likely to be treated with local ablative therapy (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.00-1.11; p = 0.05), as were men with Charlson Comorbidity Index > 1 (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.29-1.43; p < 0.01), men between 71 and 80 years (OR 3.70; 95% CI 3.43-3.99; p < 0.01), men with Medicare insurance (OR 1.38; 95% 1.31-1.46; p < 0.01), and an income < $47,999 (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.06-1.21; p < 0.01). At the hospital-level, local ablative therapy was less likely to be performed in academic/research facilities (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.32-0.64; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Local ablative therapy for PCa treatment is more commonly offered among older and comorbid patients. Future studies should investigate the uptake of these technologies in non-hospital-based settings and in light of recent changes in insurance coverage.",0
"To compare the treatment efficacies of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), HIFU combined with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a), and HIFU combined with GnRH-a and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) for adenomyosis. We conducted a literature search in SCIENCE DIRECT, COCHRANE LIBRARY, WILLEY ONLINE LIBRARY, PUBMED, and TAYLOR FRANCIS. A total of 471 articles identified, 12 were included in a systematic review, and 11 of them deemed quantitively eligible included in the meta-analysis. The efficacies of the three treatment regimens were assessed using the dysmenorrhea and menstrual scores at 3, 6, 12, 24 months. Of the three regimens, HIFU combined with GnRH-a and LNG-IUS provides the best outcome. On dysmenorrhea score at 6 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity with P < 0.00001 (I2 = 100% WMD 21.44 [6.34, 36.53]) with statistical significance P = 0.005. At 12 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.00001 (I2 = 100% WMD 23.47 [6.00, 40.94]) with statistically significant P < 0.008. At 24 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.0005 (I2 = 92% WMD 6.05 [4.81, 7.30]) with statistical significance P < 0.00001. HIFU combined with GnRH-a and LNG-IUS on menstrual score at 3 months was significantly different higher heterogeneity with P < 0.00001 (I2 = 100% WMD 56.23 [16.01, 96.45]) with statistical significance P = 0.006. At 6 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.00001 (I2 = 99% WMD 93.86 [64.15, 123.57]) with statistical significance P < 0.00001. At 12 months there was significantly different higher heterogeneity P < 0.00001 (I2 = 99% WMD 97.13 [67.81, 126.46]) with statistical significance P < 0.00001 compared to treatments with only HIFU and HIFU combined with GnRH-a. HIFU combined with GnRH-a and LNG-IUS treatment is more effective than only HIFU monotherapy and HIFU combined with GnRH-a.",0
"BACKGROUND: The size of catheter-based ultrasound devices for delivering ultrasound energy to deep-seated tumors is constrained by the access pathway which limits their therapeutic capabilities. PURPOSE: To devise and investigate a deployable applicator suitable for minimally-invasive delivery of therapeutic ultrasound, consisting of a 2D cylindrical sectored-ring ultrasound phased array, integrated within an expandable paraboloid-shaped balloon-based reflector. The balloon can be collapsed for compact delivery and expanded close to the target position to mimic a larger-diameter concentric-ring sector-vortex array for enhanced dynamic control of focal depth and volume. METHODS: Acoustic and biothermal simulations were employed in 3D generalized homogeneous and patient-specific heterogeneous models, for three-phased array transducers with 32, 64, and 128 elements, composed of sectored 4, 8, and 16 tubular ring transducers, respectively. The applicator performance was characterized as a function of array configuration, focal depth, phasing modes, and balloon reflector geometry. A 16-element proof-of-concept phased array applicator assembly, consisting of four tubular transducers each divided into four sectors, was fabricated, and characterized with hydrophone measurements along and across the axis, and ablations in ex vivo tissue. RESULTS: Simulation results indicated that transducer arrays (1.5 MHz, 9 mm OD × 20 mm long), balloon sizes (41-50 mm expanded diameter, 20-60 mm focal depth), phasing mode (0-4) and sonication duration (30 s) can produce spatially localized acoustic intensity focal patterns (focal length: 3-22 mm, focal width: 0.7-8.7 mm) and ablative thermal lesions (width: 2.7-16 mm, length: 6-46 mm) in pancreatic tissue across a 10-90 mm focal depth range. Patient-specific studies indicated that 0.1, 0.46, and 1.2 cm3 volume of tumor can be ablated in the body of the pancreas for 120 s sonications using a single axial focus (Mode 0), or four, and eight simultaneous foci in a toroidal pattern (Mode 2 and 4, respectively). Hydrophone measurements demonstrated good agreement with simulation. Experiments in which chicken meat was thermally ablated indicated that volumetric ablation can be produced using single or multiple foci. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of a novel compact ultrasound applicator design capable of focusing, deep penetration, electronic steering, and volumetric thermal ablation. The proposed applicator can be used for compact endoluminal or laparoscopic delivery of localized ultrasound energy to deep-seated targets.",0
"Background.Noninvasive and cell-type-specific neuromodulation tools are critically needed for probing intact brain function. Sonogenetics for noninvasive activation of neurons engineered to express thermosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) by transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) was recently developed to address this need. However, using TRPV1-mediated sonogenetics to evoke behavior by targeting the cortex is challenged by its proximity to the skull due to high skull absorption of ultrasound and increased risks of thermal-induced tissue damage.Objective.This study evaluated the feasibility and safety of TRPV1-mediated sonogenetics in targeting the motor cortex to modulate the locomotor behavior of freely moving mice.Approach.Adeno-associated viral vectors was delivered to the mouse motor cortex via intracranial injection to express TRPV1 in excitatory neurons. A wearable FUS device was installed on the mouse head after a month to control neuronal activity by activating virally expressed TRPV1 through FUS sonication at different acoustic pressures. Immunohistochemistry staining ofex vivobrain slices was performed to verify neuron activation and evaluate safety.Results.TRPV1-mediated sonogenetic stimulation at 0.7 MPa successfully evoked rotational behavior in the direction contralateral to the stimulation site, activated cortical neurons as indicated by the upregulation of c-Fos, and did not induce significant changes in inflammatory or apoptotic markers (GFAP, Iba1, and Caspase-3). Sonogenetic stimulation of TRPV1 mice at a higher acoustic pressure, 1.1 MPa, induced significant changes in motor behavior and upregulation of c-Fos compared with FUS sonication of naïve mice at 1.1 MPa. However, signs of damage at the meninges were observed at 1.1 MPa.Significance.TRPV1-mediated sonogenetics can achieve effective and safe neuromodulation at the cortex with carefully selected FUS parameters. These findings expand the application of this technique to include superficial brain targets.",0
"PURPOSE: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an intractable disease for which various treatments have been attempted, but with little effect. This study aimed to measure the effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and sonodynamic therapy (SDT), which are currently being used to treat brain tumors, as well as sono-photodynamic therapy (SPDT), which is the combination of these two. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with C6 glioma cells in a cortical region and treated with PDT, SDT, and SPDT. Gd-MRI was monitored weekly and 18F-FDG-PET the day before and 1 week after the treatment. The acoustic power used during sonication was 5.5 W/cm² using a 0.5-MHz single-element transducer. The 633-nm laser was illuminated at 100 J/cm². Oxidative stress and apoptosis markers were evaluated 3 days after treatment using immunohistochemistry (IHC): 4-HNE, 8-OhdG, and Caspase-3. RESULTS: A decrease in tumor volume was observed in MRI imaging 12 days after the treatment in the PDT group (p<0.05), but the SDT group showed a slight increase compared to the 5-Ala group. The high expression rates of reactive oxygen species-related factors, such as 8-OhdG (p<0.001) and Caspase-3 (p<0.001), were observed in the SPDT group compared to other groups in IHC. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that light with sensitizers can inhibit GBM growth, but not ultrasound. Although SPDT did not show the combined effect in MRI, high oxidative stress was observed in IHC. Further studies are needed to investigate the safety parameters to apply ultrasound in GBM.",0
"OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative safety and effectiveness of 2 prostate cancer treatment ablation modalities: irreversible electroporation (IRE) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).  METHODS: Two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) on IRE and HIFU were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted in PubMed and EMBASE. Independent reviewers assessed literature eligibility and abstracted safety and effectiveness data. Oncological, safety, functional, and quality of life (QOL) outcomes were examined for each technology. MAs were conducted where data quality and availability allowed, using normal methods and a random/mixed effects model, and quality assessments performed. RESULTS: Fifty-five publications (n = 22 IRE; n = 33 HIFU) were included in the SLRs, and MAs were conducted on negative in-field post-procedure biopsy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level reduction, potency, urinary continence, and AE rate outcomes. MAs revealed that IRE patients had lower mean percent PSA level reductions, higher mean rates of in-field negative post-treatment biopsy, and higher rates of potency maintenance than HIFU patients. Most adverse events (AEs) reported were comparable and minor (Grades I, II), with urinary tract infection, dysuria, hematuria, and incontinence or urgency most frequently reported. The proportion of patients experiencing a severe AE (≥Grade III) ranged from 0 to 8% after IRE and HIFU. Both modalities were associated with positive functional outcomes as well as maintenance of QOL after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both IRE and HIFU were found to produce favorable effectiveness outcomes and have low complication rates while minimally impacting patient urinary and erectile function and maintaining overall QOL. These real-world findings can help guide clinical decision making and improve disease management for patients with prostate cancer.",0
"Focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with intravenous microbubbles (MBs) has been shown to increase drug delivery to the spinal cord in animal models. Eventual clinical translation of such a technique in the sensitive spinal cord requires robust treatment monitoring to ensure efficacy, localization, safety, and provide key intraprocedural feedback. Here, the use of passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of MB emissions with a spine-specific detector array in the context of transvertebral FUS sonications is investigated in silico. Using computed tomography-derived human vertebral geometry, transvertebral detection of MBs is evaluated over varying source locations with and without phase and amplitude corrections (PACs). The impact of prefocal cavitation is studied by simulating concurrent cavitation events in the canal and pre-laminar region. Spatially sensitive application of phase and amplitude is used to balance signal strengths emanating from different axial depths in combination with multiple dynamic ranges to elicit multisource viewing. Collectively, the results of this study encourage the use of PAM in transvertebral FUS applications with PACs to not only localize sources originating in the spinal canal but also multiple sources of innate amplitude mismatches when corrective methods are applied.",0
"Radical treatments and active surveillance are valid therapeutic approaches for low-risk prostate cancer. The oncologic effectiveness and morbidity of Radical Prostatectomy (RP) and radiotherapy have been broadly validated. Focal therapies pursue to reduce the morbidity observed after radical treatments, while preserving the oncologic effectiveness. This study aims to review the state-of-the-art about principles, oncologic effectiveness, morbidity, and side-effects associated with leading focal therapies. We review and summarize articles related with Cryotherapy, High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound (HIFU), Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), and Irreversible Electroporating (IRE) published in MEDLINE from 2000 to 2022. There is a wide heterogeneity in terms of the measurement of effectiveness and morbidity. Hence, comparing different energies, strategies and protocols seem to be unprecise and controversial. Cryosurgery and HIFU have reported more clinical experience than PDT and IRE. Biochemical recurrence rate after the first session varied from 4.5% to 23%, and up to 20% of patients underwent a salvage radical treatment. The reported incidence of erectile disfunction and urinary incontinence ranges from 3% to 50% and 0% to 34%, respectively. None randomized clinical trial comparing any focal therapy to any radical treatment has been published. We conclude that the expansion of focal therapies requires the consolidation of MRI-guided fusion biopsies in everyday clinical practice. Short-term oncologic effectiveness has been proved and supports their usefulness in low-risk patients unfit for surgical treatment. However, long-term effects and the clinical experience in intermediate and high-risk patients remains limited. Currently none of the focal therapies can be considered the Gold Standard for low-risk patients.",0
"We investigated the effect of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) on gene expression related to alcohol dependence and histological effects on brain tissue. We also aimed at determining the miRNA-mRNA relationship and their pathways in alcohol dependence-induced expression changes after focused ultrasound therapy. We designed a case-control study for 100 days of observation to investigate differences in gene expression in the short-term stimulation group (STS) and long-term stimulation group (LTS) compared with the control sham group (SG). The study was performed in our Experimental Research Laboratory. 24 male high alcohol-preferring rats 63 to 79 days old, weighing 270 to 300 g, were included in the experiment. LTS received 50-day LIFU and STS received 10-day LIFU and 40-day sham stimulation, while the SG received 50-day sham stimulation. In miRNA expression analysis, it was found that LIFU caused gene expression differences in NAc. Significant differences were found between the groups for gene expression. Compared to the SG, the expression of 454 genes in the NAc region was changed in the STS while the expression of 382 genes was changed in the LTS. In the LTS, the expression of 32 genes was changed in total compared to STS. Our data suggest that LIFU targeted on NAc may assist in the treatment of alcohol dependence, especially in the long term possibly through altering gene expression. Our immunohistochemical studies verified that LIFU does not cause any tissue damage. These findings may lead to new studies in investigating the efficacy of LIFU for the treatment of alcohol dependence and also for other psychiatric disorders.",1
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain but is also an important obstacle for the effective delivery of therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been shown to reversibly disrupt the BBB. However, treatment of diffuse regions across the brain along with the effect on Alzheimer's disease relevant pathology need to be better characterized. This study is an open-labelled single-arm trial (NCT04118764) to investigate the feasibility of modulating BBB permeability in the default mode network and the impact on cognition, amyloid and tau pathology as well as BBB integrity. Nine participants [mean age 70.2 ± 7.2 years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 21.9] underwent three biweekly procedures with follow-up visits up to 6 months. The BBB permeability of the bilateral hippocampi, anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus was transiently increased without grade 3 or higher adverse events. Participants did not experience worsening trajectory of cognitive decline (ADAS-cog11, MMSE). Whole brain vertex-based analysis of the 18F-florbetaben PET imaging demonstrated clusters of modest SUVR reduction in the right parahippocampal and inferior temporal lobe. However, CSF and blood biomarkers did not demonstrate any amelioration of Alzheimer's disease pathology (P-tau181, amyloid-β42/40 ratio), nor did it show persistent BBB dysfunction (plasma PDGFRbeta and CSF-to-plasma albumin ratio). This study provides neuroimaging and fluid biomarker data to characterize the safety profile of MRgFUS BBB modulation in neurodegeneration as a potential strategy for enhanced therapeutic delivery.",1
"OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, including agitation and aggressive behavior. These symptoms increase with disease severity, ranging from 10% in mild cognitive impairment to 50% in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, pose a great risk for self-injury and injury to caregivers, result in high rates of institutionalization and great suffering for patients and families. Current pharmacological therapies have limited efficacy and a high potential for severe side effects. Thus, there is a growing need to develop novel therapeutics tailored to safely and effectively reduce agitation and aggressive behavior in AD. Here, we investigate for the first time the use of focused ultrasound combined with anesthetic-loaded nanodroplets (nanoFUS) targeting the amygdala (key structure in the neurocircuitry of agitation) as a novel minimally invasive tool to modulate local neural activity and reduce agitation and aggressive behavior in the TgCRND8 AD transgenic mice. METHODS: Male and female animals were tested in the resident-intruder (i.e., aggressive behavior) and open-field tests (i.e., motor agitation) for baseline measures, followed by treatment with active- or sham-nanoFUS. Behavioral testing was then repeated after treatment. RESULTS: Active-nanoFUS neuromodulation reduced aggressive behavior and agitation in male mice, as compared to sham-treated controls. Treatment with active-nanoFUS increased the time male mice spent in social-non-aggressive behaviors. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that neuromodulation with active-nanoFUS may be a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms, with special focus on agitation and aggressive behaviors. Further studies are necessary to establish cellular, molecular and long-term behavioral changes following treatment with nanoFUS.",1
"Background Neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer disease) characterized by the deposition of various pathogenic forms of tau protein in the brain are collectively referred to as tauopathies. Identification of the molecular drivers and pathways of neurodegeneration is critical to individualized targeted treatment of these disorders. However, despite important advances in fluid biomarker detection, characterization of these molecular subtypes is limited by the blood-brain barrier. Purpose To evaluate the feasibility and safety of focused ultrasound-mediated liquid biopsy (sonobiopsy) in the detection of brain-derived protein biomarkers in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy (PS19 mice). Materials and Methods Sonobiopsy was performed by sonicating the cerebral hemisphere in 2-month-old PS19 and wild-type mice, followed by measurement of plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species (30 minutes after sonication in the sonobiopsy group). Next, spatially targeted sonobiopsy was performed by sonicating either the cerebral cortex or the hippocampus in 6-month-old PS19 mice. To detect changes in plasma neurofilament light chain (a biomarker of neurodegeneration) levels, blood samples were collected before and after sonication (15 and 45-60 minutes after sonication). Histologic staining was performed to evaluate tissue damage after sonobiopsy. The Shapiro-Wilk test, unpaired and paired t tests, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used. Results In the 2-month-old mice, sonobiopsy significantly increased the normalized levels of plasma p-tau species compared with the conventional blood-based liquid biopsy (p-tau-181-to-mouse tau [m-tau] ratio: 1.7-fold increase, P = .006; p-tau-231-to-m-tau ratio: 1.4-fold increase, P = .048). In the 6-month-old PS19 mice, spatially targeted sonobiopsy resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in plasma neurofilament light chain after sonication of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (P < .001). After optimization of the sonobiopsy parameters, no excess microhemorrhage was observed in the treated cerebral hemisphere compared with the contralateral side. Conclusion This study showed the feasibility of sonobiopsy to release phosphorylated tau species and neurofilament light chain to the blood circulation, potentially facilitating diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

"BACKGROUND: Coronary microthromboembolism after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) requires urgent and effective treatment. Early and effective recovery of coronary microcirculation perfusion for the management of AMI would be crucial for better prognosis. Ultrasound assisted thrombolysis in the in-vitro experiments have great potential for the elimination of acute coronary microthromboembolism, especially with stable cavitation using low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) and dodecafluoropentane-loaded acoustic phase-change nanoparticles (DDFP@NPs). Therefore, our study sought to perform animal experiments using this novel treatment method in a porcine model with acute coronary microthromboembolism for further investigation of potential therapeutic values. METHODS: Porcine model with acute coronary thromboembolism was established using percutaneous coronary intervention and autologous thrombus injection. For ultrasound assisted thrombolysis, DDFP@NPs were prepared by rotary evaporation and sonication process, and LIFU was optimized. Echocardiography and TTC staining were performed for the evaluation of porcine model establishment and treatment effect. RESULTS: The treatment using LIFU guided DDFP@NPs had almost completely recanalized culprit coronary branch after treatment procedure, and smaller infarcted size (5.4 ± 1.0%), better LVEF (52.5 ± 1.8%) and better coronary microcirculation after 28 days of treatment, which outperformed treatments using LIFU+SonoVue microbubbles (infarcted size: 26.4 ± 3.5% and LVEF: 37.2 ± 3.1%) and LIFU only (infarcted size: 32.2 ± 3.1% and LVEF: 32.2 ± 0.4%) (all P < 0.05), while the treatment effect were similar to treatment using intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator (infarcted size: 4.9 ± 0.9% and LVEF: 53.1 ± 1.1%) (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study has innovatively established a treatment method using DDFP@NPs combined with LIFU irradiation for coronary thrombolysis and verified its treatment effect with high-efficient thrombolysis in the in-vivo experiments, which can be considered as powerful experimental evident of the novel method for potential clinical use of acute coronary thrombolysis. Multidimensional experimental investigations and cautious verification may need before the method could be used as treatment before preliminary clinical trials.",1
"OBJECTIVES: MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) is an emerging non-invasive treatment. It is helpful in investigating the mid-term grading efficacy and safety of MRgFUS, and possible risk factors in participants with painful bone metastases. METHODS: This four-center prospective study enrolled 96 participants between June 2016 and May 2019 with painful bone metastases. The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Brief Pain Inventory-Quality of Life (BPI-QoL) score, morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD), and the adverse events (AEs) were recorded before and at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after MRgFUS. The repeated ANOVA tests were used to analyze the change in NRS and BPI-QoL, and logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the possible risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 82 participants completed the 3-month follow-up period. And 16 (19.5%) participants were complete responders (CR), 46 (56.1%) participants were effective responders (ER), and the other 20 (24.4%) participants were non-responders (NR). The NRS (2.67 ± 2.47 at 3 months compared to 6.38 ± 1.70 before treatment) and BPI-QoL score (3.11 ± 2.51 at 3 months compared to 5.40 ± 1.85 before treatment) significantly decreased after the treatment at all time points (p < 0.001). Eleven adverse events were recorded and they were all cured within 1 to 52 days after treatment. The non-perfused volume (NPV) ratio (p = 0.001) and the bone metastases lesion type (p = 0.025) were the key risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: MRgFUS can be used as a non-invasive, effective, and safe modality to treat painful bone metastases. NPV ratio and the lesion type may be used as affecting factors to predict the mid-term efficacy of MRgFUS. KEY POINTS: • MRgFUS can be considered a non-invasive, effective, and safe modality to treat painful bone metastases. • The NRS and BPI-QoL score at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months all decreased significantly (p < 0.001) after receiving MRgFUS. Among 82 participants, 16 (19.5%) were complete responders, 46 (56.1%) were effective responders, and the other 20 (24.4%) were non-responders. • According to logistic regression analysis, non-perfused volume ratio and the bone metastases lesion type were the affecting factors to predict the mid-term efficacy of MRgFUS. The adjusted OR of non-perfused volume ratio was 0.86 (p = 0.001), and osteoblastic lesion type was 0.06 (p = 0.025).",1
"Background Recent consensus statements and clinical trials have assessed the value of MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery for pain palliation of bone metastases; however, a comparison with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has not been performed. Purpose To compare safety and effectiveness data of MRI-guided focused ultrasound and EBRT in the treatment of bone metastases. Materials and Methods Participants with painful bone metastases, excluding skull and vertebral bodies, were enrolled in a prospective open-label nonrandomized phase II study between January 2017 and May 2019 and underwent either MRI-guided focused ultrasound or EBRT. The primary end point was the overall response rate at 1-month following treatment, assessed via the numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain (0-10 scale, with zero meaning ""no pain"" and 10 meaning ""the worst pain imaginable""). Secondary end points were improvements at 12-month follow-up in NRS and quality of life (QoL) measures, including the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), QoL-Questionnaire Cancer-15 Palliative Care (QLQ-C15-PAL), and QoL-Questionnaire Bone Metastases-22 (QLQ-BM22) and analysis of adverse events. Statistical analyses, including linear regression, χ2 test, and Student t test followed the per-protocol principle. Results Among 198 participants, 100 underwent MRI-guided focused ultrasound (mean age, 63 years ± 13 [SD]; 51 women), and 98 underwent EBRT (mean age, 65 years ± 14; 52 women). The overall response rates at 1-month follow-up were 91% (91 of 100) and 67% (66 of 98), respectively, in the focused ultrasound and EBRT arms (P < .001), and complete response rates were 43% (43 of 100) and 16% (16 of 98) (P < .001). The mean baseline NRS score was 7.0 ± 2.1 for focused ultrasound and 6.6 ± 2.4 for EBRT (P = .16); at 1-month follow-up, they were reduced to 3.2 ± 0.3 and 5.1 ± 0.3 (P < .001), respectively. QLQ-C15-PAL for physical function (P = .002), appetite (P < .001), nausea and vomiting (P < .001), dyspnea (P < .001), and QoL (P < .001) scores were lower in the focused ultrasound group. The overall adverse event rates were 15% (15 of 100) after focused ultrasound and 24% (24 of 98) after EBRT. Conclusion MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery and external beam radiation therapy showed similar improvements in pain palliation and quality of life, with low adverse event rates. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

"Magnetic resonance imaging-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is an innovative treatment for patients with painful bone metastases. The adoption of MR-HIFU will be influenced by several factors beyond its effectiveness. To identify contextual factors affecting the adoption of MR-HIFU, we conducted a group concept mapping (GCM) study in four European countries. The GCM was conducted in two phases. First, the participants brainstormed statements guided by the focus prompt ""One factor that may influence the uptake of MR-HIFU in clinical practice is..."". Second, the participants sorted statements into categories and rated the statements according to their importance and changeability. To generate a concept map, multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were conducted, and average ratings for each (cluster of) factors were calculated. Forty-five participants contributed to phase I and/or II (56% overall participation rate). The resulting concept map comprises 49 factors, organized in 12 clusters: ""competitive treatments"", ""physicians' attitudes"", ""alignment of resources"", ""logistics and workflow"", ""technical disadvantages"", ""radiotherapy as first-line therapy"", ""aggregating knowledge and improving awareness"", ""clinical effectiveness"", ""patients' preferences"", ""reimbursement"", ""cost-effectiveness"" and ""hospital costs"". The factors identified echo those from the literature, but their relevance and interrelationship are case-specific. Besides evidence on clinical effectiveness, contextual factors from 10 other clusters should be addressed to support adoption of MR-HIFU.",1
"The aim of this study was to ascertain the safety of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 (CIN 2/3) in patients with fertility requirements. This was a prospective one-arm study. Consecutive CIN 2/3 patients diagnosed with histopathology were screened, enrolled and treated from September 2019 to September 2020 in the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College. All patients were treated with a combination of HIFU and antiviral treatment with REBACIN. The scheduled follow-up visits were 1 week, 1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo and 12 mo after surgery. The primary outcomes included cure and human papillomavirus clearance rates. We screened 287 consecutive CIN 2/3 patients in our hospital, 29 of whom were enrolled and treated in this study. The cure rate reached 82.8% at 7 mo after treatment and 96.6% within 1 y. The HPV-negative rate reached 72.4% (21/29) around 6 mo after treatment, with mild side effects during and after the procedure. Our study suggests that in CIN 2/3 study participants with fertility requirements, HIFU + REBACIN therapy is a safe and effective therapeutic option with a high cure rate, HPV clearance and few side effects.",1
"BACKGROUND: In this study, the changes of vaginal microbiome after focused ultrasound (FU) treatment were evaluated to explore the possible mechanism of FU in the treatment of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. METHODS: This study was nested in the FU arm of a prospective cohort study. A total of 37 patients diagnosed with HR-HPV infection-related cervical low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study from October 2020 to November 2021, and these patients were treated with FU. We used 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing to profile the vaginal microbiota composition of patients before and 3 months after FU treatment. RESULTS: After FU treatment, HR-HPV was cleared in 24 patients, with a clearance rate of 75.0% (24/32). Lactobacillus iners was the predominant species among all samples. No significant difference was found in alpha-diversity index before and 3 months after FU treatment (P > 0.05), but the rarefaction curves showed that the vaginal microbial diversity before FU treatment was higher than that after FU treatment. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) showed that Bifidobacterium contributed the most to the difference between the two groups at the genus level, and the abundance after FU treatment was significantly higher than that before treatment (P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease of vaginal microbial diversity may be related to the clearance of HR-HPV infection, and FU treatment contributed to the decrease of vaginal microbial diversity. Increased Bifidobacterium abundance in the vaginal microbiome may be associated with clearance of HR-HPV infection, and FU treatment may contribute to the increase in Bifidobacterium abundance. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:  This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on 23/11/2020 (ChiCTR2000040162).",1
"Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) are high grade glioma (HGG) that occur primarily in children, and represent a leading cause of death in pediatric patients with brain tumors with a median overall survival of only 8-11 months. While these lesions were previously thought to behave similarly to adult HGG, emerging data have demonstrated that DIPG are a biologically distinct entity from adult HGG frequently driven by mutations in the histone genes H3.3 and H3.1 not found in adult glioma. While biopsy of DIPG was historically felt to confer unacceptable risk of morbidity and mortality, multiple studies have demonstrated that stereotactic biopsy of DIPG is safe, allowing not only for improved understanding of DIPG but also forming the basis for protocols for personalized medicine in DIPG. However, current options for personalized medicine in DIPG are limited by the lack of efficacious targeted therapies for the mutations commonly found in DIPG. Multiple treatment modalities including targeted therapies, immunotherapy, convection enhanced delivery (CED), and focused ultrasound, are in various stages of investigation.",1
"Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), now known as Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) is a devastating pediatric brain tumor with limited treatment options and a very poor prognosis. Despite more than 250 clinical trials aimed to treat children diagnosed with DMG, no curative therapies currently exist for this patient population. A major obstacle has been the intact blood brain barrier (BBB) which prevents most therapeutics from crossing into the tumor bed. Focused Ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging, noninvasive medical technology which has been shown in both preclinical and clinical research to disrupt the blood brain barrier safely and temporarily. FUS blood brain barrier opening has been studied in combination with chemotherapies in preclinical DMG models, and this technology is now being investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors. Focused ultrasound has additional mechanisms of action, including sonodynamic therapy and radiation sensitization, that hold promise as future DMG therapies as well. This paper, largely based off the proceedings from a workshop held by the Focused Ultrasound Foundation in October of 2021, summarizes the current state of the field of focused ultrasound for DIPG/DMG, including preclinical, technical, and clinical summaries in addition to recommended next steps for continued advancement of the game changing technology of Focused Ultrasound.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most prevalent movement disorders in adults and may be highly disabling for some. Magnetic resonance image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS) has been shown to control tremor efficaciously and with acceptable risk. To date, paresthesia and ataxia are the most common adverse effects (AE). Nevertheless, the impact of MRIgFUS thalamotomy on balance is not well established. METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent MRIgFUS for ET and completed 6 months of follow-up. Tremor severity and functional disability were assessed using the Essential Tremor Rating Scale and the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was applied to objectively measure balance status. RESULTS: All treatments were successful. The sonication target was 1-2 mm above the depth of the intercommissural line. Procedures lasted less the 2 h, with an average of 8 sonications per patient. Twenty-four patients were included in the tremor analysis. The hand tremor score was improved by 76% after 6 months of follow-up and 87% of patients self-reported marked improvement (≥75%). Disability scores showed marked improvement (78%), leading to a significant improvement in quality of life. At the final follow-up, 48% of the patients reported no side effects. When present, AE were generally transient and were considered mild in 96% of affected patients. Paresthesia and subjective feeling of unsteadiness were the most common persistent complaints (23% and 20%, respectively). Regarding objective ataxia, BBS scores remained stable throughout follow-up for most patients. Only 2 patients suffered a mild worsening of balance although no patients experienced moderate or severe ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective feeling of unsteadiness is one of the most frequent AE after MRIgFUS, although objective ataxia is infrequent and mild. Selecting the most appropriate lesion location and procedural parameters should increase treatment benefits while reducing side effects.",1
"OBJECTIVE: One of the key metrics that is used to predict the likelihood of success of MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy is the overall calvarial skull density ratio (SDR). However, this measure does not fully predict the sonication parameters that would be required or the technical success rates. The authors aimed to assess other skull characteristics that may also contribute to technical success. METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied consecutive patients with essential tremor who were treated by MRgFUS at their center between 2017 and 2021. They evaluated the correlation between the different treatment parameters, particularly maximum power and energy delivered, with a range of patients' skull metrics and demographics. Machine learning algorithms were applied to investigate whether sonication parameters could be predicted from skull density metrics alone and whether including combined local transducer SDRs with overall calvarial SDR would increase model accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 77.1 (SD 9.2) years, and 78% of treatments (49/63) were performed in males. The mean SDR was 0.51 (SD 0.10). Among the evaluated metrics, SDR had the highest correlation with the maximum power used in treatment (ρ = -0.626, p < 0.001; proportion of local SDR values ≤ 0.8 group also had ρ = +0.626, p < 0.001) and maximum energy delivered (ρ = -0.680, p < 0.001). Machine learning algorithms achieved a moderate ability to predict maximum power and energy required from the local and overall SDRs (accuracy of approximately 80% for maximum power and approximately 55% for maximum energy), and high ability to predict average maximum temperature reached from the local and overall SDRs (approximately 95% accuracy). CONCLUSIONS: The authors compared a number of skull metrics against SDR and showed that SDR was one of the best indicators of treatment parameters when used alone. In addition, a number of other machine learning algorithms are proposed that may be explored to improve its accuracy when additional data are obtained. Additional metrics related to eventual sonication parameters should also be identified and explored.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy is an innovative method for the unilateral treatment of essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) related tremor. Our aim was to assess cognitive changes following MRgFUS thalamotomy to better investigate its safety profile. METHODS: We prospectively investigated the cognitive and neurobehavioral profile of patients consecutively undergoing MRgFUS within a 2-year period. Patients had a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment before and six months after MRgFUS thalamotomy. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 40 patients (males 38; mean age±SD 67.7 ± 10.7; mean disease duration±SD 9.3 ± 5.6; ET 22, PD 18 patients). For the whole sample, improvements were detected in tremor (Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Rating Scale for tremor 35.79 ± 14.39 vs 23.03 ± 10.95; p < 0.001), anxiety feelings (Hamilton Anxiety rating scale 5.36 ± 3.80 vs 2.54 ± 3.28, p < 0.001), in the overall cognitive status (MMSE 25.93 ± 3.76 vs 27.54 ± 2.46, p 0.003; MOCA 22.80 ± 4.08 vs 24.48 ± 3.13, p < 0.001), and in quality of life (Quality of life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire 36.14 ± 12.91 vs 5.14 ± 6.90, p < 0.001 and PD Questionnaire-8 5.61 ± 4.65 vs 1.39 ± 2.33, p 0.001). No changes were detected in frontal and executive functions, verbal fluency and memory, abstract reasoning and problem-solving abilities. CONCLUSION: Our study moves a step forward in establishing the cognitive sequelae of MRgFUS thalamotomy and in endorsing effectiveness and safety.",1
"An orthotopically allografted mouse GL26 glioma model (Ccr2RFP/wt-Cx3cr1GFP/wt) was used to evaluate the effect of transient, focal opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) on the composition of tumor-associated macrophages and microglia (TAMs). BBB opening was induced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) combined with microbubbles. CX3CR1-GFP cells and CCR2-RFP cells in brain tumors were quantified in microscopic images. Tumors in animals treated with a single session of MRgFUS did not exhibit significant changes in cell numbers when compared with tumors in animals not receiving FUS. However, tumors that received two or three sessions of MRgFUS had significantly increased amounts of both CX3CR1-GFP and CCR2-RFP cells. The effect of MRgFUS on immune cell composition was also characterized and quantified using flow cytometry. Glioma implantation resulted in increased amounts of lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils in the brain parenchyma. Tumors administered MRgFUS exhibited increased numbers of monocytes and monocyte-derived TAMs. In addition, MRgFUS-treated tumors exhibited more CD80+ cells in monocytes and microglia. In summary, transient, focal opening of the BBB using MRgFUS combined with microbubbles can activate the homing and differentiation of monocytes and induce a shift toward a more pro-inflammatory status of the immune environment in glioblastoma.",1
"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine the effect of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) in ischemic heart failure (IHF) and explore the potential neuroimmune mechanism. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to ultrasound (US) with specific parameters, and electrocardiograms were recorded to analyze the effect of LIFU and/or vagal denervation on heart rate. Thereafter, myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by left anterior artery ligation, and LIFU was performed three times a day for 25 days after MI. Echocardiography, Masson staining, and ELISA were used to evaluate the effect of LIFU on the structure and function of the heart. Finally, ELISA, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis were performed to determine the effect of LIFU on the inflammation and the expression of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP)-related mediators. RESULTS: LIFU reduced heart rate in rats (control vs LIFU, P < .01), and vagotomy (VT) eliminated this effect of LIFU on heart rate (VT vs LIFU + VT, P > .01). LIFU-ameliorated IHF in terms of cardiac structure and function (MI vs MI + LIFU, P < .01), but VT abrogated the beneficial effect of LIFU (MI + VT vs MI + LIFU + VT, P > .01). After the treatment of LIFU, decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines, increased proportion of anti-inflammatory macrophages, and increased expression of CAP-related mediators (MI vs MI + LIFU, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: LIFU ameliorates IHF whereas the CAP plays a promising role. LIFU has the potential to be a novel nonpharmacological and noninvasive therapy for the treatment of coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular diseases.",1
"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of focused ultrasound (FU) at different focal depths in treating vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 84 patients with VLS. Among them, 43 cases were treated with FU at a focal depth of 2.5 mm and 41 cases at a focal depth of 4.0 mm. Therapeutic time, treatment energy, postoperative efficacy, complications and recurrence rates were compared. RESULTS: No statistically substantially differences in age, disease course, history of immune system diseases, lesion size and severity of symptoms were found between the two groups. All patients successfully received FU therapy. No significant difference in curative rate was observed between the two groups at 3, 6 and 12 months after FU therapy. At 12 months after FU therapy, the recurrence rate of the experimental group (FU treatment at 2.5 mm focal depth) was lower than the control group (FU treatment at 4.0 mm focal depth) (7.0% vs 24.4%, p = 0.027). The experimental group was treated for a shorter period of time [22.69 ± 0.64 (min) vs 24.93 ± 0.72(min), p = 0.022] and at a lower dose[5,026.05 ± 148.00(J) vs 5,484.26 ± 160.60(J) p = 0.039]. CONCLUSION: Compared with that at the routine focal depth (4.0 mm), FU therapy at a low treatment depth (2.5 mm) can achieve a similar therapeutic effect but lower recurrence rate, therapeutic time and treatment energy. This work provides insight into the optimization of clinical protocols.",1
"OBJECTIVE: To compare the acute and chronic safety and treatment effects of non-invasive hepatic histotripsy vs. percutaneous microwave (MW) ablation in a healthy porcine model. METHODS: This was a dual-arm study in which each animal (n = 14) received either a single hepatic microwave (n = 6) or histotripsy (n = 6 single treatment; n = 2 double treatment) under ultrasound guidance. The goal was to create 2.5-3.0 cm short-axis treatments in similar locations across modalities. Animals were survived for 1 month with contrast-enhanced CT imaging on days 0, 2, 7, 14, and 28. On day 28, necropsy and histopathology were performed. RESULTS: All procedures were well-tolerated. MW ablation zones were longer and more oblong, but equivalent in the short axes to histotripsy zones on immediate post-procedure CT (p < 0.001 and p = 0.45, respectively). Overall, MW volumes were larger (21.4 cm3 vs. 13.4 cm3; p = 0.001) and histotripsy treatment zones were more spherical (p = 0.007). Histotripsy zones were close to the prescribed size (p < 0.001). Over the study period, histotripsy treatment zones decreased in volume while microwave ablation zones slightly increased (-83% vs. +17%, p = 0.001). There were several imaging-only findings: Branch portal vein thrombus with both histotripsy (7/8) and MW (6/6), hematoma in 2/6 MW only, and a gallbladder injury in 1/6 MW animals. The ablation zones demonstrated complete cellular destruction for both modalities. CONCLUSION: Histotripsy was associated with more spherical treatments, fewer biliary complications, and greater treatment zone involution. Hepatic MW and histotripsy treatment in a normal porcine model appear at least equally effective for creating treatment zones with a similar safety profile. KEY POINTS: • Microwave ablation and histotripsy for liver treatment in a healthy porcine model yield equivalent procedural tolerance and cellular destruction. • Histotripsy was associated with more spherical treatments, fewer biliary complications, and greater treatment zone involution over the 28-day follow-up period. • These findings confirm the safety and efficacy of hepatic histotripsy and support the pursuit of clinical trials to further evaluate the translatability of these results.",1
"A toroidal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer was used to non-invasively treat liver tissues in vivo in a pig model. The transducer was divided into 32 concentric rings with equal surface areas operating at 2.5 MHz. First, attenuation of skin, fat, muscle and liver tissues was measured in fresh animal samples to adjust the energy delivered to the focal zone. Then, 8 animals were included in the present protocol and placed in a dorsal decubitus proclive position at an angle of 15°. The device was held by hand, and sonications were performed during apnea. Two thermal HIFU lesions were created in 40 s in each animal. The average abdominal wall thickness was 14.8 ± 1.3 mm (12.5-17.6 mm). The longest and shortest axes of the HIFU ablations were 20.9 ± 6.3 mm (14.0-33.7 mm) and 14.2 ± 5.5 mm (7.0-22.0 mm), respectively. All HIFU lesions were visible on sonograms. The correlation between the dimensions of the HIFU lesions observed on sonograms and those obtained during gross examination was r = 0.84. Creating large and fast ablations with reliable ultrasound imaging guidance in the liver using this handheld device may represent a new therapeutic option for patients with liver tumors.",1
"PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of histotripsy subcutaneous (SQ) fat treatment in an in-vivo porcine model, and evaluate evolution of the treated volume on MRI and pathology. METHODS/MATERIALS: 10 histotripsy SQ fat treatments were completed in 5 swine, divided into four groups based on pre-determined survival: day 0 (n = 4), day 7 (n = 2), day 28 (n = 2), and day 56 (n = 2). A 4.0 × 4.0x2.0 cm ovoid treatment was created in the fat pad of the posterior thorax. MRI of survived animals were obtained on day 7 (n = 6), day 28 (n = 4), and day 56 (n = 2), and reviewed for size and imaging characteristics. Technical success was defined as the creation of a treatment zone in the targeted SQ fat. Skin firmness and indentation were qualitatively scored. RESULTS: Histotripsy had a 100% (10/10) technical success for creation of SQ fat treatments. Mean treatment time was 35.5 min (range 35-36.5). The volume of treated SQ fat demonstrated 92% volume reduction over the study. Day 0 gross pathology treatment had a mean volume of 12.6 cm3 (± 2.1) (prescribed volume of 16.7 cm3), which decreased to 8.3 cm3 (± 2.8) by day 7 (34% overall decrease), 3.0 cm3 (± 0.5) by day 28 (76% overall decrease), and 1.0 cm3 (± 1.2) by day 56 (92% overall decrease). Mean firmness and indentation scores showed no change from baseline at all time points, with no overlying skin injury. CONCLUSION: Histotripsy safely and effectively treated SQ fat of an in-vivo porcine model, with volume reduction over time.",1
"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the effect of fat-layer thickness and focal depth on the pressure and temperature distribution of tissue. METHODS: Computer simulations were performed for the skin-fat layer models during high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment. The acoustic pressure field was calculated using the nonlinear Westervelt equation and coupled with the Pennes bioheat transfer equation to obtain the temperature distribution. To investigate the effect of the thickness of the fat layer on pressure and thermal distributions, the thickness of the fat layer behind the focal point (z = 13.5 mm) changed from 8 to 24 mm by 2 mm step. The pressure and temperature distribution spectra were extracted. RESULTS: The simulated results were validated using the experimental results with a 98% correlation coefficient (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference between the pressure amplitude and temperature distribution for the 8-14 mm thickness of the fat layer (p < 0.05). By changing the focal point from 11.5 to 13.5 mm, the maximum acoustic pressure at the focal point increased 66%, and the maximum temperature was 56%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Considering the specific treatment plan for each patient, according to the skin and fat layer thicknesses, can help prevent side effects and optimize the treatment process of HIFU.",1
"Bilateral thermal capsulotomy with magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS-capsulotomy) is a promising treatment option for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Herein, we investigated the effects of bilateral thermal capsulotomy with MRgFUS on neural oscillations in treatment-refractory OCD patients. Eight patients underwent resting-state MEG with repeated recordings before and 1 and 6 months after MRgFUS-capsulotomy, and the oscillatory power and phase coherence over the entire cortical sensor area were measured. After MRgFUS-capsulotomy, the high beta band power in the fronto-central and temporal areas decreased at 1 month and remained stable for 6 months. Cortical connectivity of the high beta band gradually decreased over the entire cortical area during the following 6 months. At 1 month, improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms was significantly correlated with changes in high beta band power in both the frontotemporal and temporal areas. The treatment effect of MRgFUS-capsulotomy may be attributed to the cortical high beta band. Our results provide an advanced understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying MRgFUS-capsulotomy and other neuromodulatory interventions for treatment-refractory OCD.",1
"OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in combination with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in treating patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). METHODS: The data of unresectable LAPC patients who received chemotherapy with or without HIFU ablation were retrieved retrospectively. The overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), cancer antigen 19-9 response rate, and safety were compared between these two groups before and after propensity score matching (PSM). RESULTS: Overall, 254 patients with LAPC were included, of whom 92 underwent HIFU ablation. After PSM to control for potential biases, HIFU was associated with improved OS (12.8 versus 12.2 months, log-rank P = .046), as compared to patients without HIFU ablation. Patients with numeric rating scale (NRS) less than 4, and receiving HIFU ablation were significantly associated with improved OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.365 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.148-0.655], P = .002; aHR = 0.490 [95% CI = 0.250-0.961], P = .038; respectively) by multivariate analyses with the adjustment of age, NRS, and tumor size. ORR was also observed to be higher in HIFU group of 30.0% than in the chemotherapy group of 13.3% (P = .039). No severe adverse events of special interest or HIFU-caused deaths were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with unresectable LAPC who received gemcitabine-based chemotherapy might benefit from additional HIFU ablation.",1
"Motor fluctuations (MF) are deemed by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) as the most troublesome disease feature resulting from the increasing impairment in responsiveness to dopaminergic drug treatments. MF are characterized by the loss of a stable response to levodopa over the nychthemeron with the reappearance of motor (and non-motor) parkinsonian clinical signs at various moments during the day and night. They normally appear after a few years of levodopa treatment and with a variable, though overall increasing severity, over the disease course. The armamentarium of first-line treatment options has widened in the last decade with new once-a-daily compounds, including a catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitor - Opicapone-, two MAO-B inhibitors plus channel blocker - Zonisamide and Safinamide and one amantadine extended-release formulation - ADS5012. In addition to apomorphine injection or oral levodopa dispersible tablets, which have been available for a long time, new on-demand therapies such as apomorphine sublingual or levodopa inhaled formulations have recently shown efficacy as rescue therapies for Off-time treatment. When the management of MF becomes difficult in spite of oral/on-demand options, more complex therapies should be considered, including surgical, i.e. deep brain stimulation, or device-aided therapies with pump systems delivering continuous subcutaneous or intestinal levodopa or subcutaneous apomorphine formulation. Older and less commonly used ablative techniques (radiofrequency pallidotomy) may also be effective while there is still scarce data regarding Off-time reduction using a new lesional approach, i.e. magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound. The choice between the different advanced therapies options is a shared decision that should consider physician opinion on contraindication/main target symptom, patients' preference, caregiver's availability together with public health systems and socio-economic environment. The choice of the right/first add-on treatment is still a matter of debate as well as the proper time for an advanced therapy to be considered. In this narrative review, we discuss all the above cited aspects of MF in patients with PD, including their phenomenology, management, by means of pharmacological and advanced therapies, on-going clinical trials and future research and treatment perspectives.",1
"Magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a rapidly developing technique used for tremor relief in tremor-predominant Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor that has demonstrated successful results. Here, we describe the neuropathological findings in a woman who died from a fall 10 days after successful MRgFUS for tremor-predominant PD. Histological analysis demonstrates the characteristic early postoperative MRI findings including 3 distinct zones on T2-weighted imaging: (1) a hypointense core, (2) a hyperintense region with hypointense rim, and (3) a slightly hyperintense, poorly marginated surrounding area. Histopathological analyses also demonstrate the suspected cellular processes composing each of these regions including central hemorrhagic necrosis with surrounding cytotoxic edema and a rim of mostly unaffected vasogenic edema with some reactive and reparative processes. Overall, this case demonstrates the correlation of postoperative imaging findings with the subacute neuropathological findings after MRgFUS for PD.",1
"Background: MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA) is under investigation for whole-gland ablation of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The ideal method for post-TULSA bladder drainage through postoperative suprapubic tube (SPT) vs indwelling urethral catheter (UC) has not been established. The objective of this study was to evaluate urinary outcomes after whole-gland TULSA, comparing postoperative SPT with UC. Materials and Methods: Two-institution retrospective analysis of whole-gland TULSA for men with grade group 1 and 2 prostate cancer. One institution placed SPT at the time of TULSA with clamp trials (day 10) and removal once voiding. The second placed UC until void trial (day 7). Outcomes included the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), urinary bother score, catheter reinsertion, stricture, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), and incontinence. Results: Forty-five patients (median age 67) were analyzed. The UC cohort (N = 26) was older (p = 0.007) than the SPT cohort (N = 19) but with similar baseline prostate volumes, IPSS, and urinary bother scores. Patients receiving UC had fewer days with catheter (p = 0.013). Although UC patients suffered more lower urinary tract symptoms at 1-month post-TULSA, there was no significant difference between IPSS scores at baseline and 6 months after surgery regardless of urinary management strategy, although the UC group noted significantly decreased urinary bother. Rates of infection were similar between groups. Six strictures were observed overall, with more in the SPT group, although the difference was not significant (4/19 [21.1%] SPT; 2/26 [7.7%] UC). At 6 months, incontinence rates were low and similar between groups (2/19 [10.5%] SPT; 4/26 [15.4%] UC) and only one patient (UC) required CIC. Conclusions: Our overall findings suggest that SPT and UC are both acceptable options for postoperative bladder drainage after whole-gland TULSA, with statistically similar rates of urinary complications but a slightly different side effect profile.",1
"Boiling histotripsy (BH) is a focused ultrasound technology that uses millisecond-long pulses with shock fronts to induce mechanical tissue ablation. The pulsing scheme and mechanisms of BH differ from those of cavitation cloud histotripsy, which was previously developed for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The goal of the work described here was to evaluate the feasibility of using BH to ablate fresh ex vivo human prostate tissue as a proof of principle for developing BH for prostate applications. Fresh human prostate samples (N = 24) were obtained via rapid autopsy (<24 h after death, institutional review board exempt). Samples were analyzed using shear wave elastography to ensure that mechanical properties of autopsy tissue were clinically representative. Samples were exposed to BH using 10- or 1-ms pulses with 1% duty cycle under real-time B-mode and Doppler imaging. Volumetric lesions were created by sonicating 1-4 rectangular planes spaced 1 mm apart, containing a grid of foci spaced 1-2 mm apart. Tissue then was evaluated grossly and histologically, and the lesion content was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Observed shear wave elastography characterization of ex vivo prostate tissue (37.9 ± 22.2 kPa) was within the typical range observed clinically. During BH, hyperechoic regions were visualized at the focus on B-mode, and BH-induced bubbles were also detected using power Doppler. As treatment progressed, hypoechoic regions of tissue appeared, suggesting successful tissue fractionation. BH treatment was twofold faster using shorter pulses (1 ms vs. 10 ms). Histological analysis revealed lesions containing completely homogenized cell debris, consistent with histotripsy-induced mechanical ablation. It was therefore determined that BH is feasible in fresh ex vivo human prostate tissue producing desired mechanical ablation. The study supports further work aimed at translating BH technology as a clinical option for prostate ablation.",1
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancer types. Early detection of PC offers the best chance of successful treatment. A noninvasive, image-guided therapy mediated by targeted nanoparticles (NPs) has the potential to improve the efficacy and safety of cancer therapies. Herein, we report a sonosensitive nanoparticle modified with anti-PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) antibodies to activate target prostate tumors. These nanoparticles (PFP@IR780@PTX@liposome NPs) were co-loaded with the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel and the sonosensitizer IR780, as well as phase-changeable perfluorocarbon (PFC) liquids. The liquid-gas phase change could be induced by low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) in vitro. We found that the PFP@IR780@PTX@liposome NPs can specifically accumulate in prostate tumors after LIFU irradiation, as monitored by ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. Meanwhile, docetaxel was controllably released from the nanoparticles to achieve enhanced chemotherapeutic therapy in vivo. These sonosensitive phase-changeable NPs can visually treat prostate cancers effectively and have a clinical potential.",1
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies in men, but patient outcomes are varied depending on extent of disease. Radical, whole-gland therapies, such as prostatectomy or radiotherapy, are definitive treatments for PCa, but they are associated with significant morbidity, including erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. Focal therapies for PCa, whereby the part of gland harboring disease is selectively treated, spares the normal surrounding structures, and minimizes the morbidity associated with whole gland treatment. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance provides advantages over ultrasound guidance, such as better localization and targeting of clinically significant PCa (csPCa), as well as MRI thermometry which optimizes tissue ablation temperatures. This review will discuss two MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) techniques - transrectal MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) and TULSA (transurethral ultrasound ablation) ablation for localized PCa. Overall, recent major trials for MRgFUS and TULSA have shown promising oncological and functional results in the treatment of low- to intermediate-risk PCa. Recent Phase II MRgFUS trials have shown better oncologic outcomes than the published results for focal ultrasound guided HIFU and may justify the additional costs associated with MRI guidance. While initial studies on TULSA have focused on subtotal gland ablation, recent trials assessing oncological outcomes for focal treatment of angular sectors have shown promise.",1
"UNLABELLED: The non-perfused volume (NPV) is an important indicator of treatment success immediately after prostate ablation. However, visualization of the NPV first requires an injection of MRI contrast agents into the bloodstream, which has many downsides. Purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning model capable of predicting the NPV immediately after prostate ablation therapy without the need for MRI contrast agents. A modified 2D deep learning UNet model was developed to predict the post-treatment NPV. MRI imaging data from 95 patients who had previously undergone prostate ablation therapy for treatment of localized prostate cancer were used to train, validate, and test the model. Model inputs were T1/T2-weighted and thermometry MRI images, which were always acquired without any MRI contrast agents and prior to the final NPV image on treatment-day. Model output was the predicted NPV. Model accuracy was assessed using the Dice-Similarity Coefficient (DSC) by comparing the predicted to ground truth NPV. A radiologist also performed a qualitative assessment of NPV. Mean (std) DSC score for predicted NPV was 85% ± 8.1% compared to ground truth. Model performance was significantly better for slices with larger prostate radii (> 24 mm) and for whole-gland rather than partial ablation slices. The predicted NPV was indistinguishable from ground truth for 31% of images. Feasibility of predicting NPV using a UNet model without MRI contrast agents was clearly established. If developed further, this could improve patient treatment outcomes and could obviate the need for contrast agents altogether. Trial Registration Numbers Three studies were used to populate the data: NCT02766543, NCT03814252 and NCT03350529.

"Magnetic resonance-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) is an established method for producing localized hyperthermia. Given the real-time imaging and acoustic energy modulation, this modality enables precise temperature control within a defined area. Many thermal applications are being explored with this noninvasive, nonionizing technology, such as hyperthermia generation, to release drugs from thermosensitive liposomal carriers. These drugs can include chemotherapies such as doxorubicin, for which targeted release is desired due to the dose-limiting systemic side effects, namely cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin is a mainstay for treating a variety of malignant tumors and is commonly used in relapsed or recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). RMS is the most common solid soft tissue extracranial tumor in children and young adults. Despite aggressive, multimodal therapy, RMS survival rates have remained the same for the past 30 years. To explore a solution for addressing this unmet need, an experimental protocol was developed to evaluate the release of thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (TLD) in an immunocompetent, syngeneic RMS mouse model using MRgHIFU as the source of hyperthermia for drug release.",1
"AIM: To explore the efficacy and possible mechanisms of Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) in alleviating spasticity caused by Spinal cord injury (SCI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We selected male Sprague?Dawley rats as subjects and performed transverse injuries on the T9 vertebra of their spinal cord (SC) to build SCI. On the 7th day after SCI, LIFU treatment was performed below the SCI segment once a day for 20 min, for 4 consecutive weeks. During treatment, a pressure sensor was used to assess the degree of spasticity. After treatment, the SC tissues from the treatment sites of the SCI+LIFU(-) and SCI+LIFU(+) groups were extracted, and high-throughput sequencing was performed to identify the changes in proteomics. In addition, expression of the growth associated protein 43 (Gap43) was validated by western blotting. RESULTS: The behavioral results suggested that after 2 weeks of SCI, the rats were significantly induced to have a spastic reaction (p < 0.05), while after 4 weeks of LIFU treatment, the spastic response of rats was significantly improved (p < 0.05). Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in Gap43 expression in the SCI+LIFU(-) group compared with the sham group, whereas after 4 weeks of LIFU treatment, Gap43 protein expression was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that LIFU is an alternative treatment that can effectively relieve spastic reactions caused by SCI, possibly by reducing abnormal neuroplasticity or axon regeneration below the SCI segment.",1
"BACKGROUND: We aimed to prepare a non-invasive, reproducible, and controllable rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage with focused ultrasound (FUS). METHODS: A rat intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) model was established by combining FUS and microbubbles (μBs), and edaravone was used to verify whether the free radical scavenger had a protective effect on the model. The brain tissue of each group was sectioned to observe the gross histology, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, cerebral infarction volume, and histopathological changes. RESULTS: Compared with the FUS group, the BBB permeability was significantly increased in the FUS + μBs (F&B) group (p = 0.0021). The second coronal slice in the F&B group had an obvious hemorrhage lesion, and the FUS + μBs + edaravone (F&B&E) group had smaller hemorrhage areas; however, ICH did not occur in the FUS group. The cerebral infarction volume in the F&B group was significantly larger than that in the FUS group (p = 0.0030) and F&B&E group (p = 0.0208). HE staining results showed that nerve fibrinolysis, neuronal necrosis, microglia production, and erythrocytes were found in both the F&B group and the F&B&E group, but the areas of the nerve fibrinolysis and neuronal necrosis in the F&B group were larger than the F&B&E group. CONCLUSIONS: A rat ICH model was successfully prepared using the μBs assisted FUS treatment, and edaravone had a therapeutic effect on this model. This model can be used to study the pathophysiological mechanism of ICH-related diseases and in preclinical research on related new drugs.",1
"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality around the world, and surgery is still the most direct and effective way to remove ICH. However, the potential risks brought by surgery, such as normal brain tissue damage, post-operative infection, and difficulty in removing deep hematoma, are still the main problems in the surgical treatment of ICH. Activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is reported to show a good therapeutic effect in hematoma clearance. Herein, a magnetic targeting nanocarrier loaded with a PPARγ agonist (15d-PGJ2-MNPs) is synthesized, which could be magnetically targeted and enriched in the area of the hematoma after intravenous injection. Subsequent application of focusing ultrasound (FUS) could enhance drug diffusion, which activates the PPARγ receptors on macrophages around the hematoma for better hematoma clearance. The 15d-PGJ2-MNP treatment alleviates brain injury, accelerates hematoma clearance, attenuates neuroinflammation, reduces brain edema and significantly improves the deficits in sensory and motor function and spatial learning ability in the ICH mouse model. This work proposes an effective magnetic targeting plus FUS method to treat ICH, highlighting its great potential in the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke.",1
"Objective.High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can induce thermal and mechanical mechanisms in a well-defined focal volume of tissues. Histotripsy is a form of mechanical HIFU that can initiate and interact with bubble(s) to cause shock scattering and perhaps atomization within the bubble(s) to fractionate most soft tissues. Ultrasonic atomization, or the ejection of fine droplets from an acoustically-excited liquid exposed to air, has been shown to erode planar soft tissue surfaces, which has led to theories that atomization is a mechanism in histotripsy. However, healthy tendons show resistance to conventional histotripsy; pre-treatment of tendons with heat increases susceptibility to histotripsy fractionation. This study investigates ultrasonic atomization and erosion from planar healthy and tendinopathic tendon surfaces as we evaluate HIFU parameters for histotripsy in tendons.Approach.Forty-sixex vivobovine tendon-air interfaces were pre-conditioned to surface wetting, heat baths of 20 °C (unaltered), 37 °C (body temperature), and 58 °C (collagen degradation), collagenase soaks for 1, 3, 5, and 24 h (mimicking tendinopathic tendons), and phosphate buffered saline soaks for 24 h. Ejected fragments, histology, and gross analysis determined erosion success. Tissue displacement from the HIFU radiation force was monitored with high-speed photography, and tissue relaxation was pixel-tracked and fit to a Kelvin-Voigt model to evaluate changes in viscoelastic properties.Main results.Results showed that atomization produced holes in 24 h collagenase tendons and surface pitting in 58 °C, 3 h, and 5 h collagenase tendons. Increased mound heights and viscoelastic constants in pre-heated (to 58 °C) and collagenase-soaking (3+ hours) tendinopathic models caused a decrease in elasticity and/or increase in viscosity, increasing susceptibility to erosion by HIFU atomization.Significance.Therefore, tendons with chronic tendinopathies may be more susceptible than healthy tendons to histotripsy fractionation.",1
"PURPOSE: To determine efficacy and safety of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation of uterine fibroids (UFs). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed women undergoing HIFU ablation for UFs between June 2018 and January 2020. Before and after HIFU, patients underwent CEUS and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. The relationship between CEUS features and ablation rate was analyzed. The time-intensity curves on CEUS were measured before and after HIFU ablation, and compared with those obtained using MRI. Adverse reactions were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included. The immediate HIFU ablation rate significantly differed between low-, iso-, and high-enhancement UFs (87.2% ± 1.6%, 83.3% ± 2.1%, and 72.9% ± 3.1%, respectively; p < 0.05). On CEUS, the peak time of the time-intensity curve was significantly longer after treatment than before treatment (32.2 ± 9.7 and 26.7 ± 9.4 s, respectively; p < 0.05). Peak intensity was significantly lower after treatment than before treatment (13.7 ± 7.5 and 30.9 ± 11.2 dB, respectively; p < 0.05). All measurements were comparable between CEUS and MRI. The most common peri- and post-procedure adverse reaction was pain, which was temporary. CONCLUSION: CEUS could dynamically and safely evaluate the immediate effects of the HIFU ablation of UFs.",1
"AIM: To study the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters in predicting the efficacy of ultrasonic ablation of fibroids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 91 patients were divided into groups based on non-perfused volume (NPV) ratio and blood supply type. The preoperative MRI parameters were measured and analysed. A correlation analysis between the MRI parameters and the NPV ratio was performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyse and determine the cut-off value of MRI parameters to predict the ablation rate of fibroids. RESULTS: The uterine fibroids group with an NPV ratio <80% and the group with an NPV ratio of ≥80% had significant differences in signal intensity (SI) at MRI T2-weighted imaging (WI), fibroid-to-rectus abdominis SI ratio (SIR) at T2WI, and blood supply type (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in fibroid volume, T2WI signal uniformity, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. The ADC value and SI and SIR at MRI T2WI in the group with poor blood supply were lower than those in the group with a rich blood supply (p<0.05). SI at MRI T2WI correlated negatively with the NPV ratio. The cut-off values for SI and SIR at MRI T2WI of fibroids whose NPV ratio exceeds 80% were 220.58 and 1.315, respectively. CONCLUSION: SI at MRI T2WI and blood supply type could be predictors of the efficacy of ablation. Ultrasonic ablation of fibroids with MRI T2WI hyperintensity and a rich blood supply had poor efficacy.",1
"INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in healthy women. High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a modern, noninvasive thermal ablation method for treating uterine fibroids. There is increasing evidence that ultrasound guided HIFU (US-HIFU) has no adverse impact on ovarian reserve but little data exists on magnetic resonance guided HIFU (MR-HIFU). There are different options to estimate ovarian reserve, perhaps the most reliable being the measurement of serum Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-four (74) premenopausal women with serum AMH 0.1 ug/L or over, aged 24-48 and with fibroids or adenomyosis treated with MR-HIFU were enrolled in our study. AMH levels were analyzed before and 3 months after the MR-HIFU treatment. Correlations between AMH level changes and position of fibroids, fibroid volume, non-perfused volume ratio, and treatment energies were studied. RESULTS: The median AMH level before the HIFU treatment was 1.20 (range: 0.1-7.75 ug/L) and after the treatment 1.23 (range: 0.1-8.51 ug/L). No significant change was detected (p = .90). The patients were divided in three subgroups depending on the baseline AMH levels. The changes were not significant in any of the subgroups. Neither did the location of the treated fibroid affect the change of AMH levels nor the total energy used during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MR-HIFU does not compromise the ovarian reserve. Neither the location of the treated fibroid nor the total energy used during MR-HIFU had any effect on the change of AMH levels.",1
"OBJECTIVES: To determine the value of dual-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics in predicting the efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation for hysteromyoma. METHODS: A total of 142 patients with 172 hysteromyomas (95 hysteromyomas from the sufficient ablation group, and 77 hysteromyomas from the insufficient ablation group) were enrolled in the study. The clinical-radiological model was constructed with independent clinical-radiological risk factors, the radiomics model was constructed based on the optimal radiomics features of hysteromyoma from dual sequences, and the two groups of features were incorporated to construct the combined model. A fivefold cross validation procedure was adopted to validate these models. A nomogram was constructed, applying the combined model in the training cohort. The models were assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). An independent test cohort comprising 40 patients was used to evaluate the performance of the optimal model. RESULTS: Among the three models, the average areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of the radiomics model and combined model were 0.803 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.726-0.881) and 0.841 (95% CI: 0.772-0.909), which were better than the clinical-radiological model in the training cohort. The IDI showed that the combined model had the best prediction accuracy. The combined model also showed good discrimination in both the validation cohort (AUC = 0.834) and the independent test cohort (AUC = 0.801). CONCLUSION: The combined model based on the dual-sequence MRI radiomics is the most promising tool from our study to assist clinicians in predicting HIFU ablation efficacy.",1
"BACKGROUND: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is used for the treatment of symptomatic leiomyomas. We aim to automate uterine volumetry for tracking changes after therapy with a 3D deep learning approach. METHODS: A 3D nnU-Net model in the default setting and in a modified version including convolutional block attention modules (CBAMs) was developed on 3D T2-weighted MRI scans. Uterine segmentation was performed in 44 patients with routine pelvic MRI (standard group) and 56 patients with uterine fibroids undergoing ultrasound-guided HIFU therapy (HIFU group). Here, preHIFU scans (n = 56), postHIFU imaging maximum one day after HIFU (n = 54), and the last available follow-up examination (n = 53, days after HIFU: 420 ± 377) were included. The training was performed on 80% of the data with fivefold cross-validation. The remaining data were used as a hold-out test set. Ground truth was generated by a board-certified radiologist and a radiology resident. For the assessment of inter-reader agreement, all preHIFU examinations were segmented independently by both. RESULTS: High segmentation performance was already observed for the default 3D nnU-Net (mean Dice score = 0.95 ± 0.05) on the validation sets. Since the CBAM nnU-Net showed no significant benefit, the less complex default model was applied to the hold-out test set, which resulted in accurate uterus segmentation (Dice scores: standard group 0.92 ± 0.07; HIFU group 0.96 ± 0.02), which was comparable to the agreement between the two readers. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a method for automatic uterus segmentation which allows a fast and consistent assessment of uterine volume. Therefore, this method could be used in the clinical setting for objective assessment of therapeutic response to HIFU therapy.",1
"OBJECTIVES: To compare pregnancy outcomes after high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation (HIFU), myomectomy and uterine artery embolization (UAE) for fertility-sparing patients with uterine fibroids and to investigate the possible mechanism of improving pregnancy by HIFU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis of 54 studies containing 12,367 patients was conducted to compare the pregnancy outcomes of three fertility-sparing therapies. And a retrospective self-control study of 26 patients with uterine fibroids from May 2019 to December 2020 was performed to assess the blood flow impedance of bilateral uterine arteries before and after HIFU. RESULTS: In the analysis by treatment option, the pregnancy rate after myomectomy was 0.43 (95% CI 0.36-0.49), which was higher than 0.18 (95% CI 0.10-0.26) after HIFU, the latter was significantly higher than that after UAE (ratio 0.08, 95% CI 0.06-0.10). The miscarriage rate after HIFU was 0.08 (95% CI 0.04-0.12), which was similar to 0.15 (95% CI 0.09-0.21) after myomectomy and also similar to 0.16 after UAE (95% CI 0.01-0.30). In the subgroup analysis, women who received ultrasound guided HIFU (USgHIFU) were more likely to have ideal pregnancy outcomes than that after magnetic resonance imaging-guided HIFU. The pulsatility index and resistance index on the right side were significantly higher 3 months after HIFU than before (1.637 ± 0.435 vs. 1.845 ± 0.469; p = 0.033; 0.729 ± 0.141 vs. 0.784 ± 0.081, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: HIFU, especially USgHIFU, may be an alternative fertility-sparing modality for patients with uterine fibroids over 40 years old. HIFU may contribute to improving pregnancy rates by elevating uterine blood flow impedance.",1
"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) for the treatment of an adenomyosis model of Bama pigs and the changes in the level of oxytocin receptor (OTR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the myometrium tissues of Bama pigs after MRgFUS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three Bama pig models of adenomyosis were established by autologous endometrial implantation and evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. After the successful construction of the model, the pigs underwent MRgFUS. Before the modeling surgery, three months after the modeling, and two months after ablation, the myometrium tissues were clipped, then embedded and H&E stained for immunohistochemical examination. The average optical density of OTR, VEGF, and COX-2 were semi-quantitatively analyzed. RESULTS: The adenomyosis models were established in all Bama pigs and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and H&E staining. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography examination showed that the uterine wall at the modeling site was significantly thickened with uneven enhancement after contrast injection. All Bama pigs with adenomyosis lesions underwent MRgFUS without complications. The expression level of OTR and COX-2 in the myometrium increased three months after modeling surgery and decreased two months after MRgFUS. The expression level of VEGF decreased two months after MRgFUS. CONCLUSION: Autologous endometrial implantation is effective in establishing the adenomyosis model of Bama pigs. It is feasible to treat adenomyosis in the Bama pig model with MRgFUS. The levels of OTR, COX-2 and VEGF in the local myometrium decreased after MRgFUS, which may be associated with symptom relief after treatment.",1
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of the combination of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), mifepristone, and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in adenomyosis treatment. METHODS: HIFU treatment was performed in 123 patients with symptomatic adenomyosis who had refused treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) at Anyang Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital. In the control group, 34 patients were treated with HIFU alone, 29 patients with HIFU combined with mifepristone, 10 patients with HIFU combined with LNG-IUS. In the study group, 50 patients were treated with HIFU combined with mifepristone and LNG-IUS. RESULTS: Uterine volume, dysmenorrhea pain score, menstruation volume score, and serum CA125 level were significantly lower after treatment with HIFU combined with mifepristone and LNG-IUS than before treatment (p < .05). Moreover, hemoglobin level was significantly higher than that before treatment (p < .05). After 24 months, the efficacy of HIFU combined with mifepristone and LNG-IUS was significantly higher than that of HIFU alone, HIFU combined with mifepristone or HIFU with LNG-IUS (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy of HIFU, mifepristone, and LNG-IUS is an effective, safe, and inexpensive treatment for patients with symptomatic adenomyosis. This combination therapy demonstrates superior efficacy to treatment with HIFU alone, HIFU combined with mifepristone, and HIFU combined with LNG-IUS.",1
