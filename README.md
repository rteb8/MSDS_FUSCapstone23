# Problem statement 
The current literature review process for the clinical team at Focused Ultrasound Foundation (FUSF) is timely, inefficient, and prone to error

# Proposed solution
The primary need for the clinical team is to determine if an article they are reviewing during their monthly literature review is related to focused ultrasound. In its simplest form, this is a binary text classification problem. Given an Excel file with article abstract and metadata features, our models need to accurately determine its relevance to focused ultrasound therapies. Our proposed solution is to fine-tune various pre-trained BERT models on a curated collection of scientific articles related to and not related to focused ultrasound. We will then select the best-performing for text classification.
